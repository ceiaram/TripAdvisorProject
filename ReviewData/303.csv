The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.   We went to our 6th floor double queen room.  The room was very clean and well appointed.  The bed was comfortable.   This Hilton is a short drive from Disneyland and most Uber / Lyft trips ran about 12 to 14 with a tip.  This place has a great little store and they serve breakfast.   We did not eat breakfast as we were always rushing out to get to the parks as fast as we could.  This Hilton Garden Inn is doing things right!

Probably not recommended if you are thinking of walking to Disneyland from there. Uber ride is around $7-9 during peak hours which is quite reasonable. There’s also regional bus shuttle which requires pre-paid tickets and is quite confusing to use the app. Hotel is going through renovation, some facilities are not completed yet. Those that are were spanking new. My room is on the high floor, newly renovated, very clean and spacious. There’s breakfast provided by the hotel but it is not free. Car parking overnight is also $20/night (expensive!). There’s a few nice restaurants within walking distance. It’s a busy area so feel kinda of secure.

I have never experienced this before: ever.  What I am annoyed about is that they were allowed to accept the reservation and not tell us about the limitations prior to our arrival.

We always  hope we are always considered a great value, as many of our customers say.  Our Internet is actually complimentary, and there is an upgraded version as well which is faster and at a cost, but most of our customers do not find a need to purchase it, as our standard is good for them.  Our breakfast is $13.95 for adults, and it is a breakfast buffet, but hat makes this an even better bargain (I go out to breakfast often with my family and friends and it is no longer a frugal treat for a party of 4), as you get the buffet, and also can pick one cooked to order item as well, such as an omelet, pancakes, or French Toast.   With tax it comes out to $15.00 for an adult, with no add on fees for extras.  Children are $6.95 which is also a good cost.  I see your point for parking fees and our hotel is currently at $15 per day, but is the least expensive in our area, unless you can find complimentary parking at one of the hotels.  I understand the frustration of paying for parking.   I just came back from San Diego and my parking fee was $47.00 per day.....that was incredibly high, but the average there was $30 and up.  If you are a regular traveler, I would also suggest that you join Hilton Honors.

In fact, one group did and they made so much food, they invited my boys and I too eat. Any place that brings good people together in this manner has my full support.
