Second, the room they first gave us was left under construction. Stained carpet, walls spackled, not painted, and a broken toilet seat. We moved our things to another room which was nicer. The next day we went to Disneyland. We don’t like anyone in our room, so we always put a “Do not disturb” sign on the door. I have never experienced this before, but when we returned to our room, we had noticed someone had entered our room. It was so uncomfortable for me.

The hotel itself looked very run down and I am not sure where they took the picture of it for the orbitz website.  The Tv barely got reception there was only two stations that mostly came in.  The bed was literally hard as a rock and had two thin as paper pillows on it.   The shower had a very little trickle of water that came out there was no pressure at all and the tub itself didn't drain until well after you were done.  There was no matt to step out on....only",May 2008,none,none,We want to first thank you taking the time in sharing your experience with the hotel.  It is a great concern when negative comments are experienced at our hotel. For the last year ownership had prided themselves on making a product that would be clean and convinient to ALL our guest.  For this reason the Hotel has done a COMPLETE renovation of the hotel and ALL our items have been changed to give the hotel a botique type of flavor.

I was very disappointed though!  My first clue should have been when they handed me an actual room KEY (I didnt know they still had these anywhere). I turn the corner to go up to my room and there was a child trying to light pieces of paper on fire in the breezeway.  There was no breakfast or even coffee (the owner told me to walk across the stree to the gas station if I wanted coffee), the pool was locked shut in 90 degree weather, and my linens were not changed once in the 5 nights I was there (I could tell by the placement of a 'mystery' stain on the sheet).  The room was dirty, there was a hole in the wall, the chain lock on the door was broken, and the maid insisted on",April 2008,none,none,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel.
