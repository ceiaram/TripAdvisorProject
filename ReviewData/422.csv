It was interesting to see such a natural area in such a built up part of the shoreline.  The waves were huge that day due to off shore storms, so there was a lot of flotsam on the beach but that did not bother us at all.  The cottages that seem to be condemned should be torn down.  They are ratty and terrible looking.  The ones on the bluff that they rent look interesting and somewhat quaint.  The ""historic"" area was interesting with a restaurant and picnic areas.  We felt ok about spending the $15 fee as we feel parks need to be supported and state funds are probably tight.  A user fee is appropriate.  We would go here again for a walk along the beach and to enjoy the birds and natural area.",April 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,47,422

The cottages looked awful and cramped also",May 2010,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,48,422
