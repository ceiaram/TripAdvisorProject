We booked a last minute trip and got a good deal. I stayed here once about 20 years ago and loved the convenience. Staying across the street is absolutely essential for families with young children. Mid day naps at the hotel spared us from the dinnertime melt downs we witnessed. It’s the only hotel that you see as you walk down the walkway to exit the parks and it’s a sight for sore eyes and sore feet. We were on the ground floor and didn’t have to hassle with stairs for our stroller which meant that the kiddos slept undisturbed after a long day.

I can assure you that your experience is highly uncharacteristic for our hotel. Upon further investigation, this seems to be the result of a miscommunication. As it turns out our reservation records indicate that you did call a week prior to your scheduled arrival and the conversation you had with our agent left them with the impression that you were canceling your reservation.  Per your request, we refunded your deposit and sent you a confirmation email for the refund and the cancellation. When your family arrived at our hotel a week later we explained that you had called and cancelled the reservation. We also shared the reservation record with the email confirmation of the cancellation and the refunded folio. We then made accommodations for your family at a neighboring hotel since we were now sold out. Upon their departure, your family did not leave our staff with the impression that they were upset and in fact they were very understanding. That said, I do realize how frustrating this must have been for you and I am truly sorry for what happened. My hope is that you can find a way to give us a chance to make it right.

I realize how important it is to get toddlers down for a nap and how frustrating it was for you to not have a room for a much needed afternoon break. Notes in our reservation system indicate that my staff did inform you when you made your reservation and during check in that you would need to move rooms. What made your room move more challenging was your specific request for a ground floor room. Due to our being sold out the night before and limited check outs on the first floor, there were very few options available. My front desk supervisor explained this to you when you called and our housekeeping staff did everything they could to expedite your room. I assure you this was made a priority, although to you it didn’t feel that it was. Your room was made ready shortly before 3pm, but certainly not as early as you requested. Please know that my staff did everything they could to get your room ready before 3pm. The following morning when your husband came into the lobby to check out, he very casually mentioned you found a bug in the vanity area and said “not a big deal” He just thought we should know. He was very friendly to the front desk agent and did not show any sign of being upset. We take every report seriously, so we had Ecolab inspect the room that afternoon and no pests were reported. The AC unit was also inspected and aside from a little wear on the weather sealing, no pests were found inside.

Regarding the AC unit, the air conditioner is set to turn off once the programed temperature is reached. That unit was also inspected and was found to be working properly. Although I am happy to participate in this public forum, I wish you would have brought your concerns to our attention during your stay or upon check out to give us the opportunity to properly address them with you.

Check in wasn't until 3pm but you can go in earlier to get a parking pass for the day so u can park there and then walk across the street to Disneyland then check-in later.  You just saved like $25. Second, the breakfast buffet is wonderful. It's not continental like most places with just toast, fruits and coffee. There was many varieties such as boiled eggs, sausage, scrambled eggs, waffles, oatmeal. My kids and I actually had a real hot free breakfast. Loved it. Just remember to try to not eat too much.

It's directly across the street from the entrance road to the Disneyland main gate plaza - it's closer to the main gates that any of the Disney properties (I've stayed at all three) that will cost you a lot more money.

If you're looking for a cost-effective place that is close to the parks, clean and comfortable, and has a decent (free) breakfast, well, look no more.   The walk to the plaza between the two Disney parks is maybe ten minutes at most.  It's a five minute walk to where the shuttles drop off, so there's really no advantage to taking the shuttle.  Of note, the Park Vue let us leave our car parked at the hotel the entire day AFTER we'd checked out.  So when we were done with our day at Disney we simply walked back to our car and took off.

I realize the room you stayed in felt a bit cramped. Room 115 can hardly be considered a closet; however if you have more than the recommended number of guests in that room I suppose it would feel like one. Room 115 is approximately 5 square feet smaller than the other rooms of the same type. When you arrived and notified my staff that you now had 4 adults and 1 child (teenagers would be considered adults in this case) they informed you that the room type you booked was too small and would not be suited for your needs. Because we were sold out and had no other room types available we offered to refund your deposit and book you a room in a neighboring hotel that could accommodate your need for a larger room.  My room division manager even walked you to the room and showed you how you may feel a bit cramped considering the number of people you had with you. You declined our offer to relocate and said the room would be fine. Contrary to your review there is ample space under the bunk bed for large suitcases and although this room only has an alcove, not a closet, there is space to hang items and storage for an extra pillow and blanket. In addition there is a credenza with 3 large drawers, and there is a luggage rack that can be set up near the bed for an additional bag. This room is really designed for 2 adults with 2 small children. In the future I would recommend that you be more specific about how many adults and children are traveling with you at the time of the reservation so the hotel can assign the appropriate room type.

I made the reservation months in advance and was told I could have a room downstairs to accommodate our needs. Once we checked in, they informed me that they didn't have the downstairs room available. There weren't really options at such short notice so we had to take their upstairs room.

I never like to leave a guest with a negative impression of our hotel or our services. I know that my staff did everything they could to accommodate your family and arrange for you to have a ground floor room. I realize your impression of the situation was vastly different. The difficulty in accommodating your request stems from the specialty room type you required. We only have 4 of those room types (2 up and 2 down). With overlapping reservations on a sold out week we were unable block the room. We offered you another room type on the first floor for the first night and would have been able to relocate you to the ground floor room you booked on the 2nd and 3rd nights of your stay, but you refused the offer.  I realize that it is not ideal to move rooms, but we were trying our best to accommodate your needs. In addition to that we arranged for the safe storage of your mother’s power scooter every night and we did offer compensation for the inconvenience. I have addressed your comments about the bathroom with my maintenance and housekeeping staff and those areas have been corrected. Overall you were unsatisfied with your stay and that is what is disappointing to me. We strive every day to provide exceptional services and accommodations to every guest. Our hope is that your will reconsider giving our hotel another opportunity to be of better service to you and your family.

From the hotel lobby to the park entrance the walk is 3 min and 40 sec.  Our primary reason for choosing this hotel is the closeness to the parks.  We stayed before at Disney's Grand Californian - yes, the special park entrance to CA Adventures is nice but you're paying 3 times the price.  Keep in mind that the other Disneyland hotels are at least a 10-15 min walk to the main park entrance (neither are connected to the parks).  Park Vue is a simple, motel-style lodging (2 floors, all room doors face out, no elevators).  Parking is included in your room rate as well as buffet breakfast and light dinners.

The closet was large and had 8 wooden hangers. The air conditioner was not loud but perfect for white noise, which we needed as you will read about on the negatives. The rooms were quite large and check-out was quick. Now for the negatives: Paper thin walls, almost as thin as the towels and toilet paper.
