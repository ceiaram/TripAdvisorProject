So if you have big family, you might want to check out the other hotels and compare.   Staff was very nice and responsive so overall we had a good stay.    Breakfast was not included in our hotel price but I checked their breakfast buffet and it looked pretty good.  Next time I might try out the breakfast buffet here.

14 helpful votes,26 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,1970s era hotel.,"I stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago in Anaheim, CA. This is a former Wyndham that is now rebranded as Delta.   You walk into a lot of expectations - the concierge has been revamped and looks decent. Once you get into room- you start to time travel. Yellow tiles, dinky bath tub, streaming shower (does not work if you are tall), old TV (not CRT!), flower carpets, elevators with doors. No complimentary breakfast either.  The only thing going for this place are nearby hotels, two of them that are this bad (friends were staying). The biggest pull for this place is Disney down the street.   So that’s that.

The Wyndham was the closest hotel that looked the nicest. Boy were we wrong. We arrived at 11:30 pm and the lobby was full of people and very very noisy. When we got to our room, we immediately noticed the constant and annoying sound of the elevators dinging and it persisted all night long. The shower had intermittent hot water. I took a mostly cold shower (which wasn't as bad as it sounds). The part that made me very upset was the fact that when I took a shower, I was standing in about three inches of water due to the drain being clogged.

4 helpful votes,5 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Totally run down room,"Not what we expected at all with the Wyndham name. Apparently the hotel is due for a renovation but the desk staff says they’ve been sold and so it hasn’t happened. Regardless when visiting Disneyland and choosing what you thought would be a high quality hotel and paying a premium for the name, you expect a clean room. The “free” shuttle to Disneyland is actually $20 a day with their resort fee. It’s really convenient but there are plenty of closer, cleaner, less expensive hotels in the area. I could go on and on. The cracks across the ceiling, the stained and worn out chairs in the room. The staff seemed friendly but frustrated, it’s not their fault this place is in disrepair.

Our bathtub looked really old and had rust spots around it. The bathtub drain and sink were both clogged then entire 5 days of our stay, despite reporting it and their promise to fix it. Other than that, check in was smooth, staff was nice, the hotel was clean, and the beds were comfortable. Whenever we needed something, they would bring it right up. I would stay there again.",December 2017,none,none,We sincerely apologize for the concerns that are mentioned in your review.  We certainly welcome the feedback for improvement.  The hotel will be going under renovations in the next few months. We hope to have the wear and tear items replaced.  The shuttle service will be an avenue we will look into regarding the time frames.  The hospitality fee is a charge unfortunately that is mandated. Being in the Disney resort this fee is throughout most hotels.  We are going through a transition and hope to remove this fee in the near future.  Thank  your again for your business and hope you will give us another try at a later time.,none,none,none,none,none,none,423,92

You can stay at the Marriot, or the Hyatt house nearby for roughly the same price, but with a much better experience.

The hotel sells a $10 package that includes self parking and a shuttle to Disney, as well as free wifi in common areas. FYI the WiFi is WIDE OPEN. Anyone can connect whether they paid the $10 or not. Second, the parking lot is completely open with no one monitoring it and you don't get a ticket for your window to show you paid. So don't waste your money. You can park in this open parking lot, and uber to disney for less than $10 a day.   Another issue was the cleanliness. Everything felt dirty and the tub had old mildew stains.

We go to great lengths to share the details of the taxes attached to all hotels in the area.....in fact, the City of Garden Grove charges 2% less in taxes than the city of Anaheim.  Unfortunately, we at the hotel don't have control over the taxes implemented by the state and the city.  We do have a hospitality fee of $23, however this is a bundled package which is a great advantage for our Disney guests as it includes the price of parking, unlimited shuttle to Disneyland, the fastest internet in the area, and 2 bottles of water.  A family of four would pay well over $30 for these charges at most of our competitors!  Our goal is not to trick or hide these costs from our guests, but offer the best package in the area.

none,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hotel,"We had a crappy experience with an Airbnb, so this hotel was the best price for the rating we could find last minute. We were pleasantly surprised. Comfy beds, fun pool with cabanas, and the asian kid who checked us in was very pleasant. Great attitude. Lots of events, but I think its great to see so many happy people getting married, etc. The extra daily fees suck, but not having to Lyft to and from Disney saved us money, and we took advantage of the pol as much as we could. They should just put that in the price though.

After an extremely long 15 hour flight, and arriving in Anaheim at 6am, all we wanted to do was get some rest! As I forgot to mention our arrival information at the time of making our accom booking, there were no rooms available for early check in on the day. Rather than send us on our way until our room was available, Kevin made calls and checked every avenue to find us a room at such short notice.

As with all hotels in the area there are lots of kids staying here due to the proximity of Disney Land. Overall we enjoyed our stay, but there were a few bumps in the road. As with many luxury or resort hotels, this one charges a resort fee in excess of $20.00 per night. The fee covers parking, shuttle buses to Disneyland, WiFi and use of the pool, excercise room and ""business center"". I asked the people at the front desk to direct me to their business center. The business center consisted of a stand up desk where you could use a computer to access the internet.

I think if you’re already paying that much for the room they shouldn’t add an extra fee per day. When I asked about it they told me its for wi-fi, parking and shuttle services. I never got the wifi password so I never used it. It was never brought up at check in. The front desk was also rude when my husband asked her to enter is reward points.

I had to ask what are you going to do to honour the discount I thought i was going to receive since I now need to buy them at the park.  It took a half an hour of the desk clerk running back and forth with the manager before finally the manager said they would apply the discount to my hotel bill.

The wallpaper is peeling and dirty, the furniture was really banged up, and there were no words for the tub. (I've attached pix for some examples.)  Now, the room was clean, the beds were comfortable and the water pressure was really great. The front desk folks were nice enough. It was just no where I felt happy to be away from home in.

none,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Wyndham Review,The customer service was great. The rooms are ok according to my discounted rate for a conference. However if the price was 200-250 a night it is not worth that price. The rooms need to be updated. Furniture scratched carpet is smelly like smoke and other smells. The bathroom door frame was rusted. The shower head was pouring too hard and you could not adjust it. The fridge seal would not allow the door to stay closed. They repaired it but the next day it continued to have problems. The tub was plugged as it filled when you took a shower. I advised them however the problem was not fixed. The tile in the bathroom was dirty. As I said before the rooms need updating.,July 2017,none,none,We're sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations and thank you for your feedback.

I was expecting some sort of breakfast buffet that other hotels typically do. It is always a nice convenience to have before hitting up the parks.  Another downside I felt was the front desk.

This is a very nice, clean, comfortable hotel with a great location next to Disneyland and other businesses. The wifi was amongst the fastest in any hotel in which I've stayed. The few things I didn't like are rather nit picky but they deserve a mention. -There's no breakfast offered -parking is ...interesting to say the least. As a lot of other travelers mentioned, the parking is shared and it's behind the building. I didn't see any security cameras so if your car got broken into for some reason, I don't think they'd catch the person.

One of our favorite things about this hotel is the free Disneyland shuttle included in the rooms.  The only reason that this property doesn't get 5 stars is because of the almost $85 in taxes we have to pay on our $210 bill for 2 nights.  I understand that tax but man.... it is really high.  I thought we got a great deal on our rooms but that was until the taxes got added on.,June 2017,none,none,We're sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations and thank you for your feedback.

Not too big of a deal since we were starving and decided to go eat. Arrived to finally check-in and was charged a 20 dollar resort fee. Useless when the business center charges to use to the computers and printers, we didn't use the pool, and there was absolutely NO parking. The cars were parked SO closely together in the tiny spaces that everyone bangs their doors on each other. I drove around for hours off and on trying to park and it made for an annoying first day, since we drove 7 hours to get there.  To top it off, the Marriot next door sold Disneyland tickets and had a starbucks, both of which were not offered by the Wyndham.

My drive to get there was 2 1/2 hours, and if I'd waited until later to leave my home, the freeway traffic would have been worse.

I did not feel that my car was in a secure area.  Then I was forced to drag my luggage around the entire hotel.  The hotel could have been cleaner, the hallways were not vacuumed.

There is a fridge but no microwave in the room. There are no vending machines on any of the floors this forces you to use their on site store which is very expensive. Also I booked through a discount site only to find out there is an 18.00 a day charge called a hospitality charge mainly for parking which is a joke. If you are out late expect to park far in an un monitored parking lot shared buy another hotel. The shuttles provided were consistently late and usally packed.

When checking in at the hotel, they again did not notify me of additional charges. You should expect: (1) Base room charge, (2) Occupancy tax of 14.5%, (3) 2.5% TID Assessment, (4) Hospitality fee, and (5) Hospitality fee tax of 14.5%.  ...This list of charges sucked because I had told my friends only the publicized base room charge for splitting the costs of our hotel room.

We do have a hospitality fee of $18 per day, however this is a bundled package which is a great advantage for our Disney guests as it includes the price of parking, unlimited shuttle to Disneyland, the fastest internet in the area, and 2 bottles of water.

The room was clean except for some rust spots near the drain.  The tub was concave, so I had to pay attention to how I was standing.  The water pressure was good.  The thermostat in the room was difficult to work, and I am not even sure if I got it right.  The top sheet on the bed felt like plastic.    For the brief visits to the desk for check-in and check-out, I was not impressed with customer service.

While the fee is mandatory, the value of this fee in relation to other hotels in the area is unparalleled and I apologize if we did not explain it better. Included in the fee is parking, internet, 2 bottles of water in your room upon arrival and unlimited daily shuttle to/from Disneyland.  We bundle these to offer a lower cost to our guests rather than charge you for each individual expense.  As such, many of our competitors charge $12 for parking, $5-$10 for internet, $3 per bottle of water and $5 for adults and $3 for children for one round trip to Disneyland.

The manager gave us complimentary drinks at the bar and breakfast as well and I couldn't be any more satisfied with my choice in hotels around Disneyland park.

As we pulled in to the parking lot however, I felt immensely frustrated over the lack of empty parking spaces. Merged with the Marriot, the parking lot was packed, leaving us circling around the lot for nearly 45 minutes before checking in. Once entering our hotel room, we were disappointed by the bathroom's poor plumbing system. The sink and toilet seemed to overfill each time they were used and the rest of the room seemed shabby in comparison to the lobby's contemporary design. As we tried to call for assistance, we were also shocked to find the phones were not working properly.

They have free transportation to the park and they offer free meals for the kids in the package that we purchased. I also really like that there is a check-in text number available. We were able to guarantee a room while still in park which made the check-in process a lot easier. Another great feature of the hotel is that it is right across the street from a target which is convenient for those with families.

She tried to select the best most convenient rooms for all in our part as we were traveling with my family. She and Vicki ended up checking us out and they both were just fantastic. We had a couple nice breakfasts at the hotel. They were buffet style and a little spendy but it was convenient. Our rooms on the other hand were just in OK condition. I think they just need a little TLC- there were cracked tiles on the floor and our faucet leaked. The furniture was also very banged up and the windows extremely dirty- in fact I noticed that through out the hotel. All of them just need a good washing.

Another $150.00 was placed on my credit card.  Spoke with manager the next day, he said charge would drop off in 3-5 business days.  And yes, it took the whole 5 days.  Also said, no other charges until I check out.  Two days later, checked credit card, guess what?  Another charge of $117.00.

It is slightly further from the magic kingdom than other choices, but I really do feel that elsewhere we would have paid a lot more for a lot less. And, it really isn't that far away - the free shuttle runs every half hour, and only takes 10-20 mins depending on traffic. We walked back one night - even with our little 5yo it wasn't too far (and it felt safe). The Wyndham has no gimmicks... it is just a very nice and comfortable place to stay. We spent 9 days staying in a family room (#203).

The rooms and lobby are very nice and the front desk staff is great and quite accommodating.

What I did not like about this hotel is the resort fee which i was told covers things like the shuttle parking (regardless even if you use valet) and other things. I was charged this fee for our first night there even though we checked in after 2:00 AM. there should be a point and time when this should not be charged like where this fee just doesn't make sense.

The 10-12 minutes we had been waiting with only two parties in front of us was not acceptable.  We didn't have the breakfast buffet and didn't know about it until we tried to actually eat a regular breakfast at the hotel.  Parking is not good...""behind the hotel"" is accurate.

Just a couple items to point out, one probably can't be changed, the other would be easily changed. A challenge is parking which for non-valet service could give one a hike to their car. On the easy to fix list -- complimentary water. The first day you find two 8oz bottles next to the nice coffee maker. Those are the only complimentary waters. Either make them complimentary every day or don't offer it at all. Charge an extra $0.50 per day for room if it's a cost thing because the customer will appreciate the attention to this detail.

The beds and pillows were amazing. My only issue were the staff up front. None of them seemed to know what they were talking about. No one was able to explain to us why we were overcharged and didn't explain deposits or extra fees to us. Instead they had us pay it up front and later call their billing department to get it fixed. And not to mention, we bought our Disneyland tickets there, and got double charged for it so our whole vacation was ruined because of lack of money. It has been a week and they still haven't gotten back to us about it and we still haven't gotten our money back. Overall, I'd say I wouldn't come back to this hotel.",June 2015,none,none,"We humbly apologize for any mistake that may have been made regarding your billing on your recent stay with us.

I usually upgrade to their executive floor rooms for a small additional fee. They did a major upgrade to property when they were bought from Crowne Plaza and it shows. The executive rooms offer in room safe, Keurig coffee makers, and are on highest floors. The grand kids love the heated pool. I like jacuzzi. They have towels at pool.

A lot has been said already on Trip Advisor about the rooms, and I’d have to agree with most of the recent reviews – very clean, very comfortable.  Having an in-room fridge was nice.  There was no view to speak of, but that’s okay – after playing at Disneyland all day it wasn’t a priority.     The hotel is in a resort complex with 3 other hotels, and there are several restaurants right in the parking lot.  There is also a Target store directly across the street.  They do offer a theme park shuttle to Disneyland, but it only runs every 30 minutes or so, and includes stops at other nearby hotels as well.

They had a charge that was called hospitality charge per day stay which I was a little annoyed about but was ok after hearing it included the parking ( still don't understand why hotels do that) and a free shuttle to disneyland ( saved us money on parking at disney). On the second day we decided to have their buffet breakfast and regretted it, the food was not very good and the price was high. All and all, I would recommend using this hotel.",June 2014,none,none,"Many thanks for being our guest and for your time in extending us this feedback, Gal.

While the hotel itself is nice the staff at the hotel are horrible.  After an 8 hour drive from Northern California we arrived about 4pm on 6/12/14.  As soon as I walked up to the front the desk the girl there just said how can I help you.  I told her I needed to check in.  She instantly asked for a credit card and my ID without any welcome to the hotel or anything.  Once she had my card and had swiped it she told me that there is a $150.00 security deposit that they charge upfront and it will not be refunded until up to 5 days after you have checked out ( a sign on their front desk says the same thing ), there is also an additional $14.03 resort fee added on to the nightly charge for self parking,",June 2014,none,none,"While we're glad to have welcomed you, we're sorry to hear that the experience missed the mark in so many ways for you.

The hotel is now Wyndham (not Crown plaza) it was nice and everyone we talked with was very friendly and helpful, I asked the maids if we get another water bottle on our second night and she had said you get them on the first night only and gave me 2 extra water anyways I thought it was nice. The water pressure in the shower is great and the room was clean the only thing I noticed is that there is no privacy sign so we were not sure how to get the room clean other than calling the front desk. The beds were good we slept great, one thing we noticed is the ding of the elevator when it stopped at our floor in the morning we were also 2 rooms away from the elevator. The shuttle is very reliable and was always on time for the most",June 2014,none,none,"Many thanks for being our guest and for taking the opportunity to lend such thoughtful feedback of the experience.

They are currently rebranding everything, but the new lobby looks great.  Elevators close faster than guillotines so make sure you have your running shoes on.  Pool area is also better than most neighboring hotels, but room service could do a better job of picking up dishes as I observed plates in the morning that were still there by dinner time.  Rooms are a bit dated.  I noticed a few outlets not working, a non-operational phone and a bath drain that was not connected whatsoever.  Beds are pretty firm but good pillows.  Bath shower head, though old, sprays a ton of pressurized water vs. some of the wimpy showers you see nowadays.
