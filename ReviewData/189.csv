This is a conference hotel, lobby and facilities often pretty crowded with conference attendees which was annoying at times. They were holding multiple different conferences every single day of my stay. Nothing remarkable about the rooms or amenities; just plain business hotel. The worst part was the unfair charges on my bill that left me feeling ripped off. I was very surprised to find self parking and valet fees were charged on same nights 7 times, which is of course impossible because I had one car.

I only booked this hotel due to low rates they were offering over the holiday season, presumably because they had few business travelers during that period of time. I quickly realized that my low rate really wasn’t that low when I was hit with a $27 a day parking fee, times two cars. We also booked two rooms for six nights each. If you do the math, it all adds up pretty quick. On top of that this hotel charges for Wi-Fi. And they tack on a fee for some sort of employee relief fund that you have to proactively decline.

Shopping was planned, good food, and we brought our three kids with us. For our reservation we requested connecting rooms, knowing full well this wouldn't happen, as they can't guarantee such things. Why? No clue.   Going in with this mindset, upon check-in, the staff member mentioned that we were ""given an upgrade"" to a suite and a $50 dining credit. Well, that sounds nice...until we get to the room and learn that we're adjacent to service elevators and an ""employee area."" Now I know what the suite was available.

Right off the 405 (though you can't hear the highway), 15 mins from Newport Beach and a footbridge connects to the fabulous South Coast Plaza mall.  Starwood also does a great job with service, food and you gotta love the Heavenly Beds and Showers.

First off, the location is even better than we had originally thought.  Not only is it a 2-minute walk across the Unity Bridge to SCP, but the hotel is also located in the same business park as South Coast Repertory and The Performing Arts Center.

From the time I pulled up to check in until I left this property, the service level was excellent in all regards.  The valet parking attendants at this hotel are by far the best I have encountered.  They were fast, courteous and attentive to guests' needs (e.g., directions, etc).  I had reserved a traditional king room and was very happy to be upgraded to the top floor of the hotel with a nice view of the surrounding area.  The bed, as usual with Westin hotels, was awesome.

AAA rates help make it a reasonable value for an upscale business hotel.

The huge South Coast Plaza shopping mall can be reached by pedestrian bridge.  The exercise facility is adequate.  The pool area is modest--in keeping with a business hotel, not a resort, but pleasant and welcoming.  Parking is expensive, in a covered ramp.

I requested a room overlooking the pool on a high floor and I was shocked to see from my room the condition of the pool.  It looked really dirty.
