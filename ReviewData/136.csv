Everyone that works here from the front desk, restaurant(bar),housekeeping, plumbing, cooks,were the kindest, warmest,most wonderful people ever!

The sweet people at the front desk always helped us with everything (even restaurant recommendations )with smiles and so much thoughtfulness.It’s right next to The Brea Mall, Target, Downtown Brea, and the world famous Brea Improv.

Not sure this happens occasionally or only happened on NYE. Second, the property is old.  I'm fine with that but the problem is not really maintained well. A bathtub faucet was leaking and wouldn't let you sleep. Third, there was not hot water on NYE. Fourth, AC works so well, but heater doesn't work at all. Fifth, the front desk staffs and GM aren't helpful or willing to help you at all. They were so passive when problems happened.  I just requested to return back my Free Night Reward, but the Hilton and GM just gave back me as points. I even didn't ask for compensation or something else.

The bed was very comfortable and the workspace was large and useful.  The breakfast was good and the omelet cooks were very friendly and capable.

Looked great on the outside and has been renovated but we were throughly disappointed with our stay. We had to switch rooms 4x due to our rooms smelling like cigarette smoke.

In the 3rd room, which still smelled like smoke my baby found toenail clippings on the carpet. In the 4th room I couldn't give her a bath because black specks were coming out of the faucet even though we drained and rinsed out the bath multiple times.

I was there alone on business and my stay can best be described as hassle-free.  The property had a lot to do with it.  Some specifics:  -- Really convenient location.  Adjacent to the Brea Mall.  Across the street (on the other side of the property) from a Target and TGIFridays.  About a mile from downtown Brea with great restaurants and shopping.    -- Using Hilton's new-ish early online check-in where you can choose your room ahead of time, I purposefully chose a room that faced the mall rather than Birch Street.  It was quiet, though my 7th floor view was that of the mall's parking lot.

Outside there's a heated lap pool.  It is so beautiful, surrounded by palm trees, grass, and lawn chairs.  Lovely even when the air temps are only in the 60's.

This authorization would only show as a pending transaction, not allowing the hotel to gain any interest during that time, and would be released by your bank/credit card company within 72 hours after departure.

The rooms were plush with great Egyptian decor.  We were able to check in at 11:30am with no questions asked.   The free breakfast buffet was wonderful!  There was an Omelet bar on one side, the other side consisted of potatoes, bacon, sausage, fruit, cereal, danishes, bagels, toast and all you can drink orange juice, milk, juices, coffee, etc.   The only little thing they did not mention was, at check in they give you a white card with your name and room number on it. You need to bring this card with you in order to have the Happy hour and the breakfast buffet.  Other than that, it was great!!!",November 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1140,136

However, due to proximity to a funeral we were attending, we opted to stay.  We are GLAD we did.  We arrived at noon, expecting to be told no room yet ready.  However, we were allowed early check-in.  Our room is one of the nicest we've had in the Embassy Suites chain (have probably stayed in 25 of them).  Immaculate, new carpet, granite-type bathroom and wet bar countertop, slate type tile bathroom floor, ""Egyptian"" motif with very nice bedding, curtains, towels.  ""Bloom"" amenities (better than the standard Neutrogena).  Did the happy hour - nachos, fancy chip mix, popcorn, 5 TVs with both football and baseball.

Hotel is under renovation, which we weren't warned about, with on going construction through out.  Which means, noise, smells, construction stuff every where.

It has gotten worse and worse every time I've stayed here and this was the last time I'm staying here.  The problems are very numerous.  First, the service is terrible.  The staff just plain lie to you.  Second, the whole hotel needs to be renovated.  The beds just killed my wife and me.  The exercise room had a lot of broken equipment, no AC, and I couldn't hear the TV (which had broken volume controls).  There were numerous noisy parties in guest rooms aroung the hotel and the staff did nothing about them.  The Manager's Reception is a joke.  I went to it one night 1/2 hour before it closed and there was no food.  The bartender actually told me that he couldn't",September 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1145,136
5 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very satisfied overall,"My girlfriend and I stayed in one of the lower penthouse suites and were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. The bedroom and bathroom alone were bigger than most hotel rooms. We thoroughly enjoyed the dual headed showers with glass enclosure, sunken Roman tub (although whirlpool jets would have been a definite plus) but most of all the large, feather down, pillow top mattress! This bed was actually hard to get out of! Very comfortable! It made up for the drab out of date furniture that needs to be replaced as the dressers and coffee table had old stains on them. Also the carpet under the bed looked like it hadn't been vaccumed in some time. The complimentary cooked to order breakfast was decent with a large variety of food to choose from.

I was surprised to see the quite negative reviews of this very nice hotel, so I'd better put my own review here, along with some pictures from some of my trips there (taken for testing new cameras). I think I have a pretty good idea about the quality of the place - I have stayed at the hotel 3 times: 1 week in 2002, 3 months in 2003 and 3 weeks in 2004. And I must say, I am a very, very satisfied guest. I cannot recognize ANYTHING with respect to mold, rude personnel etc. The three rooms, I have stayed in (and the rooms of my co-workers) have always been very high-standard and clean.

The hotel is pretty much a standard Embassy Suites (as another reviewer stated) with a reasonable breakfast and decent sized rooms. My main complaints are the parking structure which is challenging to negotiate unless you drive a small car and the rooms can be noisy if neighboring guests are throwing parties (there are wedding receptions and other events held here). This is a nice central location to stay if you plan on venturing out to the outlying areas like Los Angeles, Orange County (Disneyland, Knotts, etc.) and there are plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1151,136
