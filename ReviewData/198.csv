Upon arriving on the 2nd floor, we could tell the hotel had not aged well.  Big scrapes on wall, doors, and wallpaper going down the hall.  The wallpaper in the room was bubbled and torn.  Had to really look for outlets to plug in electronic devices.  Looking behind the nightstand and beds we found the baseboards covered in dust.  Pillows were lumpy.  Parking was inadequate.  We had to park in a nearby parking garage our last night.  We told the front desk and they said they would subtract the parking cost from our bill but did not.

Firstly as with all Hilton properties lately there was no upgrade for room. Just a standard for being a Diamond member. They said they only had a single housekeeper on staff and people were in The lobby waiting for a room. My first room would not open after reprogramming the keys twice, so I was given a second room.  Older, worn, but clean. Decent view, and surrounding area is nice. All rooms have the fridge removed, just a big empty cabinet. Even Hampton properties have a small fridge! Then They charged $20 a night for parking, when during the virus there is about 5 cars in the entire lot, no shuttle working. No restaurant, no gym, no pool, and no cookies.

So I'll give a quick review. If you're going to stay at a double tree it pays to be a Hilton honors member.   Why? Here's a few reasons. 1) Free Wi-Fi in your room, otherwise you'll pay $10 per day or you'll have to use it in the lobby.  2) Free breakfast buffet, which is otherwise $22 per person and is only worth about half that. Don't get me wrong it's a very nice spread of hot, cold, juices, fruits and prepared dishes to choose from, but that price is outrageous especially if you have a family.  The business center is excellent and has a very convenient and helpful coupon book that's a must for travelers which will be dining locally.   Valet and self parking is the same price $11 so",June 2012,none,none,"Thank you for your response on Tripadvisor.com!

45 helpful votes,52 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Solid Hotel,"Doubletree Club is a solid hotel.  Front desk staff were friendly and welcoming upon check-in, and the room was spotless.    The fitness room features an exercise bike, treadmill, and elliptical trainer, plus a weight bench and selection of free weights from 5 - 50 pounds--very nice, although the ceiling's a bit low if you're over 6'3"" on the elliptical trainer.  Watch your head!  Towels are provided both here and at the pool.  The pool is long enough to feel like you can do a few lengths (but not too long--maybe 40 feet?  Depth ranges from 3.5 - 5 feet), and there is a nice hot tub.  Both are in full view of the interstate and the adjacent office buildings, but I had them to myself on a night the hotel was fairly full.

none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,I was robbed!,"""I am so mad!  Ok. The hotel was clean, free parking, comfortable bed, decent room service. Whatever.  Here's the problem.  I was double charged for the room.  I called the hotel and was told first, that I checked out late.  Then, that I stayed an extra day.  Neither of which was true.  Then I was told that although I'd checked out on the TV I left my stuff in the room and therefore didn't really check out.  Not true either.    The desk guy proceeded to tell me that the computer isn't wrong and he didn't know what to tell me.  After talking to some chick named Steph and a guy named Andy I'm still waiting for ""approval"" from the GM to reverse the charges.    This is why I never leave home w/o my Amex.

The property is clean and well-run. The rooms were plenty large and the beds were comfortable. Breakfast included a smaller but better-quality selection of items than would be found in the brand-mate Hampton Inns. Parking is free.  Guests appeared to be a mix of families on vacation, individuals traveling for business, and teams traveling for athletic events.   Although we had a non-smoking room, the smell of cigarettes entered the bathroom via the vent. Covering the vent with a towel removed the problem. The outdoor public areas have more ashtrays than is typical for a California hotel.

The hotel is very close to Cal State Irvine and also very close to downtown Irvine.  I have stayed here on business trips and in conjunction with youth basketball league tournaments.  The staff is friendly every.single.time I call or ask for anything.  The buffet breakfast is completely acceptable and usually included in the price of the room at the rate I reserve.  Internet access in the room always works, and the room itself is comfortable and pleasant.  Central air-conditioning would be a bonus, becuase the window air conditioners now in use can be noisy.
