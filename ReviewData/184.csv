This review is false. Your reservation was not cancelled due to over booking but due to your behavior. We had to deny you a room. Our front desk had  called you  to notify you that your card had declined when we tried to validate/ authorize your credit card to ensure a guest provides us an authentic credit card. Usually a hotel will not give you a courtesy call or try and get in touch with the guest when this happens and cancels the reservation but we do give our guests a benefit of the doubt and allow them to give us another valid credit card and in your case this is what the front desk did. But instead of appreciating this phone call you verbally abused the front desk and was not cooperative, you started to use profanity and threatened to use the power of the internet to write  a negative review ( you succeeded, but I hope people read both sides to this story). Both the front desk and I were trying to explain to you what this call was for but for some reason you did not want to understand why you were being contacted. Once we finally just had to make a decision to not have you as our guest due to your behavior we had to say please do not come in and we will be cancelling your reservations. We cannot accommodate someone who is going to be screaming at us , using profanity through out their stay. This all happened due to a courtesy call that was benefiting you. It just didn't make sense to us. It still does not. We did notify your booking agency of this and they agreed we were in the right and we followed protocol.

The bed was squeaky. It seemed that they remodeled their lobby which was nice. Although, they should remodel their rooms too and change their comforters to modernize the room. The ocean view rooms are more like partial view. On the other hand, they have a pool and a jacuzzi which can be used anytime as long as you'll be quiet, the owner said. I called almost all the hotels around the area and all of them were way more expensive. This is the cheapest rate that we got for $89 for a monday night and she upgraded our room with a balcony ocean view. That was nice but still, I think it was a bit pricey for a Monday night and the room was small.

She was so helpful and friendly that  we felt as if we were staying with a friend. Mrs Duncan is keen to give the Hotel a character all its own (she and her husband have only recently taken over) and to that end there are interesting paintings around the hotel - an artist was at work on a fabulous mural while we were there.

During the course of remodeling her home, we needed a place to stay during the demolition.

We then found a small add in a weekly flying advertising a weekly rate at a Laguna Beach motel on the PCH.  We actually stumbled onto Best Inn by accident.  Wendy, the front desk receptionist was awesome and said she had a great weekly rate that was just a bit higher than the motel we were originally trying to find.

I was suckered into giving it a try....; My bad..... never again. It is NOT in a great location. You cannot see the beach. The major roadway is right out the door. The property is old with new paint....  The real beaches are to the south. The only upside is a nice bluff top park you can walk to, but if you go to the beaches below the bluff they are small and filled with rocks......  To get to any decent beach we had to drive and then parking took forever. Know what you want before you book.
