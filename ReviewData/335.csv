The hotel kindly upgraded us from a studio to a one bedroom suite due to our Spire status.  It was very crowded and almost fully booked. There was a team of student athletes checking in ahead of me and there was only one person manning the front desk in the evening so there was a bit of a wait. The sports team was very loud but thankfully we were not assigned a room near them. We were on the ground floor in the East side (I think that's where many people with pets are assigned) since we had our dog with us ($75 fee).

We made the reservation(system generated by your third party supplier) based on what was sent to us.

Because your kids were attempting to check-in with no one of legal age, we were left with no other options but to decline their reservation.

Yes, we are under renovation to make our guests experience better than ever. We also know how important it is to get a good nights rest. That's why we enforce a policy that our renovation crew start their day after 9am and end no later than 6pm with minimum noise requirements throughout the day. So, although noise during renovation is a necessity, we do our best to keep it to a minimum. As for noise in the hotel from 8pm to 6am(due to a clothing company), this is new to our entire staff. We would never knowingly condone or permit any business operating in the hotel, shipping and receiving packages throughout the night. This is the first time this has ever been mentioned. Packages are generally picked up at our front desk when our guests return from their day, not after midnight or into the early hours of the morning.

The hotel is located in a residential area in the hills about a 10 minute drive from the Irvine Spectrum.  The room was $150/night for a 1 king bedroom suite. They must have run out of rooms because I was given a sweet two bedroom suite. It was very spacious, clean, cool and comfortable. The staff was very helpful with recommending  nearby restaurants. I overheard one guest complaining about the traffic noise from Bake Parkway. The bedroom I slept in faced that road.  Other than the occasional loud motorcycle, traffic noise was not an issue.

It was clean and comfortable.  The room was fully stocked with all the amenities needed for an extended stay.  It even had a dishwasher!  Guest laundry facilities were complimentary (never heard of).   In addition, this hotel is in a residential location off the main road, so it was very quiet.  The front desk staff was very helpful about informing me of the local attractions and providing me with a map as well.  The price was better than any decent hotel I looked into in Irvine area.  Parking was plentiful and free (a plus).  The free hot breakfast was great with plenty to chose from.

Our room had a 2 burner range, a mircrowave, and a full size refrigerator w/ ice maker. The price of the room included breakfast which had a nice selection of fruit, cereals, and pastries as well as hot items such as, scrambled eggs, bacon, and waffles.      Adjacent to the lobby was a patio with BBQ grills, pool, several tables and chairs, and a basketball court! Our team had an impromptu BBQ and the staff was so unbelievably accommodating. Especially Cassie, one of the managers. She went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met. Her service rivals that of any 5 star hotel!

This impeccably maintained, well-managed property, nestled in the county’s most inland reaches, was a great find.    We are in the fifth week of our stay in a well-appointed, one-bedroom suite.  The room is equipped with a granite full kitchen comfy bedroom and sleeper-sofa-equipped living room.  Housekeeping is thorough and consistent.    The best aspect of this hotel is the staff.

The day that we checked out my daughter notioced that they had left a DVD case with 30 plus DVD's in it and called back to the Hotel front desk to have the go to the room and hold it for her. The front desk manager stated the she had the case and would lock it up so when my daughter returned to California in a two weeks she could pick up.  If anyone reading this has small children like my daughter with 4 small boys you know how important their movies are when you travel any distances.

The hotel, rooms and grounds are beautiful.    The rooms have the little kitchenette with the refrigerator and freezer so you can load up at the grocery store and cook for yourself.  Coffeemaker, dishes, utensils, etc. are all there.  No table for a family meal in the one bedroom suite, but a small counter with two chairs.  The living room is small, but more than ample.  Lots desk space if you are working.  The shower, though dark, had great water pressure.  Older TVs with not so great a picture, which is odd for such a new hotel, but it didn't bother us much.

14 helpful votes,21 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Was perfect for our family vacation.,We stayed here because it was the cheapest and best rated room in the Irvine area that I could find with a full kitchen.  The hotel is 3 years old so everything looks brand new.  We got a great rate (called the hotel the morning we checked in).  The breakfast buffet was really yummy and they served rice for breakfast too which is a plus.  On certain days during the week they also served something around dinner time.  We only had to provide our own food for lunch.  Service was excellent and I would stay there again.  At the time we had a 6 month old and a 2 and 1/2 year old.  The only downside is that the closest highway is a toll road.  It is a little ways to the other highway but we never used the toll road.,August 2009,none,none,"Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for the wonderful comments.

While preparing an excel chart so that I could objectively compare the facilities of the suite hotels in the Lake Forest area, I was unable to include one section – customer service – for at that time how was I to know how committed everyone at Staybridge would be to their guests?   Yes, I had a hint that this staff may be caring and truly concerned while making preliminary arrangements with Scott, but that was just a feeling. Cleo, the front desk manager, immediately addressed every concern and Blanca, also at the front desk, was extremely helpful.

1 helpful vote,6 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Perfect home away from home!,"I selected this hotel as a ""home base"" to use while visiting friends and family in the area. I did a bit of research before selecting this hotel, but it basically came down to a random selection between this and the other nearby suite hotels. I couldn't have been happier with my choice! The rooms are large and bright, the staff is friendly, and the location is great for getting around South Orange County. The hotel is located at the edge of a business park so it's off the main drag, but just minutes from a large shopping center with a supermarket, restaurants, Target, movie theater, etc. The hotel also has easy access to main freeways, the tollway and the Irvine Spectrum shopping center.

This hotel just opened earlier this year.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  They serve a great breakfast each morning (it isn't dry sweet rolls and bagels on a plate).  They also serve a light snack, beer and wine in the evening (free and served Mon-Thurs).  Although they call this a ""snack"" it has certainly can serve as dinner.  They have free laundry facilities.   During our stay (over 30 days, we were waiting for a home to be completed), we saw families on vacation and a lot of business people.
