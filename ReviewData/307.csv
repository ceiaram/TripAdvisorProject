Such nice rooms and a really nice (free) breakfast. I usually skip the Residence Inn breakfasts because they are not always edible. But this one pleasantly surprised me. Really good biscuits & gravy on Saturday morning and the scrambled eggs were good both days. Coffee was pretty good too!

Washers and Dryers available for laundry. Food was good.  A few things that need to be remediated:  We arrived at 3:00 pm and only one of our two rooms was ready.

It was a great place to stay for a family visit, 35(+/-) minutes from Disneyland and 35(+/-) minutes from Lego-land.  You can see Costco from the property so that is nice for less expensive gas and a quick cheap bite to eat.  Albertsons (grocery store) right up the street.  Beach was 5 minutes away.  With a family you should go to ""baby beach"" as the nice locals had recommended to us.  Pool was small, but no big deal it was not crowded and if you need more room the ocean is right down the street.  The staff was great!  Breakfast staff was all very friendly as well as the housekeepers and Front Desk staff.",June 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,238,307

I was pleasantly surprised at how new and clean the RI SJC is. My room was a studio with a King bed and was quite spacious for my three day stay.  The gym is small, but well equiped.  I noticed a family with a dog at the firepit, and the manager told me that any size dogs are allowed.  That makes like a mandatory stop for my family and our 60 lb 'puppy'.  While there is nothing in walking distance, the restaurants in San Juan Capistrano are only a 5 min drive.  And the cafes and shopping areas on Avenida Del Mar in San Clemente are only 10 mins by freeway.  I drove 3 min down the road to Doheny Beach for a run at sunset.  Very central to everything.

Being that it is owned by Marriott I was willing to give it another try. I was really impressed by how nice this hotel was!!  The front desk staff was very nice. When I book my room with Marriott I always ask for a feather free room. When we got to our room the pillows were not feather free even though they got us the feather free pillows I still woke up with red swollen eyes.  I guess I need to just travel with my own pillow! The bed was very comfortable! The kitchen and dining room area were adorable! It was clean and comfortable! The free breakfast was perfect- lots of choices!

There was a shuttle that provided transportation within a 5 mile radius. Nice location, close to San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, Doheny Beach.  Pool area was a little small but there was a firepit, putting green, basketball court, a jacuzzi - everything you would expect at a Residence inn.  Yes, the $12 parking fee was very annoying,   Comfy bed.   Breakfast was standard RI fare.   We faced the street, had a view of the car dealer across the street, but didn't hear any noise.   Would definitely stay here again if we return to the area.",June 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,241,307

Very good breakfast and they even serve dinner three nights a week to their guests.  How often do you see a staff member serve birthday cake for one of the extended stay guest with a big smile on her face ?? We only stayed two night at this location however I wish we could have stayed there the other 3 nights because it was far above the other hotel.

It was a wonderful stay. The hotel is new so it is sparkling and very clean. I loved the decor. The location was near enough to the beach, but not walking distance. There aren't many choices for food nearby that we could find. We were craving Japanese, but couldn't find one near enough to the hotel. We ended up having Chinese food, which was just okay. There is a Costco right next door. I'm sure it is walkable, but I decided to drive there. We bought a lunch of hot dogs and pizza from there and brought it back to the pool.   The pool area is small, but nice and clean. Again, since everything is brand new, the whole area looked nice.

Short, curt, not at all friendly. Was given a room facing Stonehill, a busy/ noisy street. Upon entering the room, went to freshen up and discovered the toilet was clogged. Called to the front desk to ask for it to be repaired, ""Laura"" said that if they couldn't fix it, that there were few options as they were full. I explained to her that I was not asking to be moved...snotty attitude.  Spent the first night in the room, figured out the following day that one of the reasons it was so noisy is that the windows did not fuly close/ seal. Faulty installation. Asked to be moved and got a first floor room facing the freeway. Suprisingly",April 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,244,307
7 helpful votes,20 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Objects are further than they appear,"Just know that, despite what your map may show, this hotel is truly not that close to almost anything.  On the flip side, It's not terribly far either from some wonderful communities.  The morning breakfast buffet is about what you'd expect ""par"" for most properties around this price.   $12.00/day is not par for self-service parking, however, and I don't think it's a fair deal given the already substantial price tag of the rooms. The room was very quiet, and the bathroom had a great, decent size shower.  It's a good property, but it's better if you know everything you'll be paying for.  Costco is right next door if you need some decent gas prices, but if you're going up toward Disney, the gas was a fair amount cheaper in Orange County.",March 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,245,307
37 helpful votes,67 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,New Property - Mixed Feelings,"This is a very new property - I believe it opened in early 2012 - so everything is new and clean. There is small pool and recreation area with ocean view and an outside lounge area including a firepit. The staff was friendly and efficient.  Knowing that this property was right on the 5 Freeway I requested a room that faced away from the freeway and the busy local road on the other side but it was hard to avoid noise. It wasn't too bad but I can't imagine there is a truly 'quiet' room given the location.  Surprisingly, there is a $12 charge for parking!! This property is not on the beach or even within walking distance. It is in an industrial/commercial area but not a metro area where parking is at a premium. So, this is basically a way of charging a guest $12 more without that",March 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,246,307

Having stayed in a number of Residence Inns, I found this to be among my best stays within the brand.  But it can get better.  The wireless Internet connectivity is spotty, the breakfast constantly runs out of necessities like tea bags, plates, etc., and there are some similar small issues.  The staff is also new and could use some seasonsing in terms of becoming familiar with the area.  I wasn't crazy about a $12/day parking fee - this is out on its own and not in a city setting where parking is at a premium.
