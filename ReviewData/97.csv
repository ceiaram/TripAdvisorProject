There is a small and useful gym and pool with a hot tub.  Not only is the room spacious and comfortable but it was relatively quiet and the breakfast is freshly made.

The sink is separated from the room with the toilet and tub which I always prefer.  Bed and bedding very comfortable.  The breakfast was fresh and complete with scrambled eggs and sausage.  Ample parking and free. Two deficits I will mention.  Although the picture shows a roaring fireplace - the fireplace was never roaring when we were there. It was a cold weekend and a crackling roaring fire in the lobby would have been nice. The desk staff said they’ve never seen it on. Also I don’t understand why the Ayres actually charges a breakage fee, then reimburses. Why don’t they just post the charge then delete it like other hotels?

Nice big rooms- bathtub is little old but has a Jacuzzi attachment (never used it though).Free wi-fi in the rooms, beautiful wooden furniture, microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker, LCD TV in the room. Comfy beds. Coin operated washing machine & dryer with washing fluid available on 2 floors near the elevators. Free beer & colas available in the lobby in the evening. Hot breakfast at lobby level- quite nice but repetitive after a couple of days. The hotel staff will drop you if needed to close by locations within limits. Very helpful reception staff.  Next door is olive garden (Italian) and El Torito (Mexican). A little further is Denny and down the hill to one side is McDonalds and other fast food places. Lots of shopping",December 2010,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,641,97

Breakfast is ok. There is an outside pool which you could not use in February. Right next to the hotel you find several restaurants. I recommend the Mexican Restaurant.

I spent days in class while she lounged at the super clean pool and hottub. The hotel is very clean and they are constantly cleaning and painting. Beds are very comfortable with Jacuzzi tubs in rooms. Full self serve breakfast daily with so good waffles, hash browns, eggs, fruit, etc. All the amenities plus a wine and snack freebie M-Th 5-7. Fresh baked cookies in the evenings. This is a 100 year old family business with 20 hotels throughout southern CA with a luxury look and a homey feel.

none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Stay!!,"We stayed at the Ayres Suites during our trip to Disneyland.  I was a bit worried it might be too far away, but it really wasn't.  It took less than 20 minutes to go to Disneyland.  At the end of each day, I was glad our hotel wasn't in the middle of all the madness surrounding DL.  There are also several close resturants, shopping and movie theaters.  Newport Beach is also less than 30 minutes away.  The hotel was quiet and we could only tell there were other guests there one night (the family above us came back around 10:30 and kids were jumping around the room.)  Our room was on the highway side, but we couldn't hear any traffic noise.  The room was big and very clean.  Housekeeping did a wonderful job making up the room.

We got a really great rate on this hotel ($69/nite) and were extremely pleased with the hotel.  The rooms were very clean and comfortable.    It was right off of the freeway, but our room was on the ""canyon side"" of the hotel - noise was not an issue.    The room was a ""suite"" of course (all rooms are here) and so it was pretty spacious and convenient to have a little living area/kitchenette.  It was very hot in CA when we were there - the public areas (hallways, stairwell) did not seem to have the AC on, but it worked fine in our room so it was comfortable.

The first room I got had a bad ordor from the carpets or BO from the workers, so I asked to be changed to another room and it was not as bad as the first room and they did spray it down which helped. The room was fine, Hot tub in the rooms are great when you had a long day. Make sure you get some soaking salts for your legs and feet. Don't use bubble bath cause you will be overflowing in bubbles and the currants in the tubs are very strong. Breakfast every morning was the best I had in years!

It had a microwave, refrigerator, and coffee pot in it. We were anticipating a flat screen TV as some of the other properties had listed it, but the Yorba Linda property is still in the process of renovating and up grading their rooms.
