Good rate.,"I've stayed at this place a few times now because it is super close to the airport and to the company I do business with in Costa Mesa.  I find the rooms comfortable.  Sure some of them could use a little touch up with paint here and there and some new tiles and grout in the tub area but overall it's a nice place.  Big rooms, very comfy beds (I always sleep well here), nice breakfast and a nice location with plenty of options to walk to for food etc.  Travelodge is not a 5 star hotel chain but if you are looking for a nice, clean, comfortable place to stay that has excellent rates, give this place a try.",February 2017,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,171,289
