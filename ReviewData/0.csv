We had a mix up with Expedia (which they were quick to fix)  and Kristopher made the check in personable and pleasant. He provided us a ready room upon arrival (which was great as we had a long morning of travel from Florida). Kristopher offered great local area dining recommendations and was very friendly. The hotel grounds were clean and anytime we requested an amenity it was delivered promptly. Housekeeping was always quick to refresh our room before we came back for an afternoon nap or pool time.

The mid century design is nice and the lobby has welcoming seating areas, water dispensers, and Matt at the bar is always friendly and gets us whatever we are looking for.

In my 5 years of being an  A/P or magic key holder as we are called now this is my favorite hotel and the best place to stay if you need to bring your Dog or if you have kids who love huge pool to play in !  My last 2 trips were  bitter sweet and were 4 weeks apart . The first trip was last minute because my dog Littleman  had passed away and I just needed to get away go to Disney and ugly cry. I left san jose at 1 am and arrived at the hotel at 7:30 am . Karen was so kind and  got my room right then at 7:30 so I could nap and relax before heading in the park. Sam and Leo  were both so kind and professional making sure I had a great trip both of them had met my dog on my trip in september and they made me feel at home,March 2022,none,none,"Hello!

California, and over the years have stayed in 7 different hotels on Harbor Blvd within walking distance to the Disneyland entrance. The Anaheim Hotel is the best one, by far, and we will definitely be coming back! Here are most the important points-  1.    SPACE = PEACE = PRIVACY  The Anaheim Hotel is on a HUGE lot, and the room wings are spread out over the property in between grass lawns. This makes for an extremely quiet property, and when you’ve spent 12+ hours being bumped and jostled at an amusement park, it’s nice to have some quiet.  2.   POOL  The Pool is Enormous!!!!

I must say my first stay was a bit better because our room was updated but this time we got a room which was noticeably dated and not renovated which was a bit of a downer. That being said I was still happy staying here since all we did was sleep there because we spend our days at the parks and just returned to sleep. This time we got a ground floor room but I would recommend a top floor room (if you are okay with stairs) because they are less noisy and I prefer having a balcony instead of a ground floor patio.

The location is solid but other than that it's not great for a Disneyland trip if thats your intention. Here are some pros and cons to this hotel.  Pros:  - Cute lobby update and pizza place right next door. - Cost, it was cheap and we snagged it on Hotwire. - Bed was actually pretty comfortable.  Cons:  - Photos online are very flattering, rooms are pretty beat up in person. - Super thin walls and doors. - Shower has evidence of things like mold and rust. - Rooms are pretty spread out and are far away from the lobby.

I've stayed in a number of them, and what differentiates the good from the bad is customer service.  Unfortunately, The Anaheim Hotel falls into the bad category.  Good customer service stems from managements attitude toward, not only it's customers, but it's employees as well, and the unempathetic attitude of management at The Aneiheim Hotel is pervasive.

If that’s all you’re looking for, you’re in luck. Based on that alone, I would have given five stars but there were a few aspects that knocked it down to four stars. First, it is a motel with outdoor entrances to rooms, not a hotel with indoor corridors. I prefer the latter and was disappointed to see this. Parking wasn’t great for the $12/night fee, but that falls within the average cost for the area ($10-$20/night). Parking is very limited, so you might not be anywhere near your building.

The front lobby has a mid century modern vibe to it with a well stocked bar and connects to The Pizza Press Restaurant.  We walked to our room which was past the large sized pool and was mostly all outside which is a refreshing change and definitely a throw back to the past.    Our room had new carpet and and a nice size bathroom.  The furniture was a few decades old but still good.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Clean & Close,Great hotel value. Very short walk to DL. Pleasant staff who greet us each time we walk by and are helpful with questions. The remodel that happened recently really improved the layout of the rooms since our last visit. The rooms are big enough for our family of three and a jogging stroller to fit comfortably. They’re also very clean and quiet.,March 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,959,0

The concierge helped to arrange all of our transportation to and from the airport and booked us on a tour of LA.  Everything was seamless!  The hotel was clean and we enjoyed our two night stay very much.  Our walk to the Disney parks was just a few minutes.  There is also a lot to do in the area.  I would definitely stay there again.,March 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,960,0

I was fortunate to arrange a room only two weeks before the Expo, which I did through a travel group associated with the event I attended.  I arrived at 3 p.m. to find their check in is normally at 4 p.m. though a staff member was kind enough to accommodate me checking in. The hotel has a very retro vibe (mid century modern) in the two story architecture, the fonts used (think 'The Jetsons'), colors, furnishings in the lobby (the rooms aren't really decorated in the same style but they are nice).   When checking into my room I could see they had done recent rennovations through there were several small things that were in disrepair and dated. This did not negatively impact my stay. When the room next to me",March 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,963,0

Thanks to Leo and Steve it was all sorted out and I was thrilled. Leo is such a fantastic employee he really pulled out trip our of the fire and turned it around. In my opinion being able to fix a problem and the way it is fixed says more than staying someplace where everything goes smooth until something goes wrong and no one knows how to act.  Well here they knew how to handle it. I will be giving this hotel another try thanks to these two gentlemen",March 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,966,0

We got a room with two king beds and there was ample space for our one night stay. The room was clean and very decent for the price we paid and the proximity to Disneyland.
