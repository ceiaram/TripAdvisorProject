none,6 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Horrific! Go somewhere else...,"This is a completely NO FRILLS Motel.  There is NO POOL, no breakfast, nothing!  The beds were absolutely horrible! Definitely not what you want after a day at Disney.  First room had peeling paint, and a warm fridge.  Got moved to a different room and that fridge froze everything!  The mattress felt more like a broken down box spring.  The floor may have been more comfortable.  There are people who seem to be long term residents and they have loud motorcycles that were revving up at 7 am every morning!  I should have never booked this place and will spend more money next time to get a better place to stay.  You should do the same!",November 2022,none,none,"Dear Guest,  Thanks for commenting.

70 helpful votes,135 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Clean but bare bones,"The place was clean. The desk staff very courteous and helpful. Location was convenient to the convention center. The price wasn't inexpensive but it was the least expensive one of our choices. It has fake hardwood floors instead of obnoxious dirty carpet and they were clean. This was the most bareboned motel room I have ever stayed out. It was like Motel 6 in the 60s (I stayed at one then and didn't like it for the same reasons I'm putting down here). There was no box of tissues, no shampoo or lotion. There was no radio/alarm clock (I like it because when you wake up in the middle of the night, you can see what time it is). There were no lamps. If you are reading in bed, you have to get out, go to the door to turn off the lights and then stumble back to your bed.

78 helpful votes,206 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great price and location for Disneyland,"We stayed at Motel 6 on a whim - our current accommodation was in Hollywood which was a good 50min drive in either direction to Disneyland, and considering we had a 2-day ticket to the parks we decided to pack a backpack and find a cheap motel to stay for the night.  We found this motel at the last minute and so glad we chose to stay here - the room was simple but it was spacious and clean and that's all that we really needed for a good nights sleep. The aircon in the room was great and the staff member that checked us in was very polite and helpful.  The area was quite nice also - if we ever return to LA I would more than likely stay in the Anaheim area again.  Overall a good stay with a great price tag, we certainly weren't disappointed.",August 2019,none,none,"Dear Valued Guest,  It is really nice to note that you liked the stay and services at our hotel during your visit.

47 helpful votes,30 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,DO NOT STAY HERE! UNSAFE AND MOTEL 6 DONT LISTEN TO COMPLAINTS,"This motel is absolutely disgusting. Don't put yourself through what we had to endure. First room the aircon flooded our room. Room we were moved to after being told we couldn’t have a refund the air con didn’t work in and it was stifling. The tap wasn’t fixed to the sink, the floor boards were coming up and trapped your feet and the pictures that had obviously been on the wall left holes. There are huge black cables hanging from the walls outside the rooms that children can easily touch. Reception was also impossible to find due to building work and the receptionist was young and inexperienced. No one cares if you're unhappy. People had things stolen from their rooms during our stay and there are nails coming from the walls where they've taken pictures downd and left the nails",July 2019,All rooms are noisy and dirty- don't stay here!,none,"Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback on your recent stay.
