The Hilton chain added the right touches and put life back into what was becoming just another “freeway adjacent” hotel. It is a prime location, just walking distance from the CSU Fullerton campus. Staff are always attentive and friendly. The cocktail lounge and dining area seem underutilized, but that more than likely has to do with scaling back per covid protocol. It is definitely a commuter hotel, but serves that purpose perfectly being close to 3 major Los Angeles freeways. The room appointments are what keep me coming back.
