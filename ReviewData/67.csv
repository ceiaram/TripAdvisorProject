But, they charge 'resort fees' and are higher priced than just a normal Marriott - without having any real reason to do so.  The check in desk located 10 feet inside the front door.  There is hardly much of a lobby to speak of, and the convenience 'store' area is just there for show.  No one was even working at it when I needed some waters, and it was located behind the front desk in a way that hid it mostly from view.  The bar was SUPER loud, and their main restaurant is located right next to the bar, so close that it also was SUPER loud as a result.

The bad:  the music throughout the resort is terrible.  It's as if a bad Abercrombie and Vegas Club had a baby.  I was at the pool by myself and the music was blaring.  I stayed on the 8th floor and could hear the music all night until 10:00.  Doesn't sound late, but for those of us traveling from East coast or Central time, it's obnoxious.  Even when it was playing loud at night; with the base bumping...there was nobody at the pool.  Whatever branding and vibe they are trying to create, doesn't match or fit the resort.
