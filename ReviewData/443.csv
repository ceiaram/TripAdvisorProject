6 helpful votes,34 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Upper Moro Campsite-Wake up to the Ocean View!!,"This is primitive camping where you need to bring in everything you need, food, water etc.  There are pit toilets and that is what you get.  You will need to bike or hike your way in but if you like to camp with a view this is the place to do it.  We MTB'd in and carrying all the amenities you need can weigh you down but it was great just the same.  We've camped twice here Upper and Lower Moro and I highly recommend Upper Moro to anyone.  It really is a great spot!",November 2017,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,443

We have a 38 ft class A motorhome and had no trouble getting around and backing into the campsite.  The restrooms and showers are private and very well made and kept.   The camp staff are very friendly and helpful.  We will be going back soon.,May 2016,Campsite 23 has white water views of the waves.,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,2,443

My husband and I were visiting my parents and wanted to do something different one night, so we lucked out and got a spot in the Sage Loop of the campground.  We invited a few more local friends, BBQed some chicken, marinated veggies, and home-made tamales on our little gas grill, watched the sun set, and sipped Pacifico and Corona in our little folding chairs.  There are no open fires allowed, and for good reason- the place is extremely dry.  Lucky for us, a windy day had swept away the marine layer that often times blocks stars, so we had a pretty clear (for Orange County) sky.  The wind typically dies down around 7, and it stayed warm enough to keep our rain fly off and fall asleep to star-gazing and hearing the",July 2014,"All campsites are set on a terraced hill, so every single one has an ocean view.

They tiered the campground so that every site has full views of the ocean.  We were in site 23 which has electrical and water and there is a dump station on site.  The sites are huge and the bathrooms are new and clean.  The only real cons are the strict 3 pm check in (no matter if someone's in your site or not) and the weeds in the campsite.  The cost is $75 per night!!!  So for that I would expect to have NO weeds all over my campsite.    The beach access is great and you have full parking priviledges at all of the Crystal Cove State Beach parking lots.  Overall it's a great place to stay with the beach, hiking and amazing views.
