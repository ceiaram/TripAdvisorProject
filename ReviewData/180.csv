It’s like being in Montana near the beach. Temps are 10 degrees cooler but you drive your car n in 2 minutes your at the beach. Staff is excellent, well informed and the restaurant is very good. But place still has a motel feeling which it was in its former life. Spa is very small, no real facilities like u would get at other resorts that say spa. If there’s an event/wedding don’t book a massage because the music goes straight into the spa so u feel like your at the wedding. Gym is too small and no bathroom.

Complaints about music even though o was trying to drown out the unsupervised children in the room next door.,February 2019,none,none,"NicolecY86OP,  You are correct that you had additional charges on your folio at check-out. These were due to a number of issues that we experienced with you and your guests during your visit. First and foremost there was a considerable mess in the room upon check-out including smoke residue, ashes, destroyed linens, marijuana smoke odor, and very badly stained carpets. Due to this we had to put the room out of order for several days to deep clean and make the room rentable again. In addition, we had complaints from every single guest that lodged near you during your visit due to the excessive noise coming from your room. Our front desk team had to put the rooms around you out of order so that we could save other guests from having their stays impacted. The suspicious activity of multiple unregistered guests in and out of the room through all hours of the day along with large quantity of marijuana found in your room at check-out was also a major bother to our other guests. Furthermore, our front desk team did give a courtesy call reminder to your guests that we are a non-smoking property – this was ignored and your guests continued to smoke in the room as well as on the patio where the smell of marijuana was bothersome to other guests. Due to these issues as well as others there were extra cleaning fees added to your account. These fees covered the excessive damage to the room as well as to help cover the refunds that were given to other upset guests. Please do reach out to me at Chris@ranchlb.com if you would like to discuss further and per our discussion on the phone you are no longer allowed here on property.

Whilst the Ranch was good, it was not as good as some other cheaper places that we stayed at in California and it was a bit of a disappointment.  The rooms are nice and clean, with plenty of space near the bathroom, but not spectacular.  The rows of rooms feel very close together and the patio outside the room lacked privacy.  There was never a parking space near the room, which meant that I needed to valet the car and then walk back down to the room each time.

1 helpful vote,9 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,What a JOKE,Seriously I must assume these good reviews are paid. Let me break it down for you as I wait for clean pillows to be delivered to a room I'm paying $745 a night for.  1. Before arriving I'm called by the spa bc due to the fact my reservation needed to be changed last minute from a facial to a massage bc this place apparently has one facialist.

Buyer beware.,"On the website The Ranch advertises lots of actives (golf, the beach, walking trails and biking) and a property were canyon meets sea.  They neglect to tell you you there is a 4 lane highway separating the two.  Upon checking in the only active on site was the golf course.  Every other activity, including the beach, needed a car to get to and you have to pay a third party for any equipment needed.  Unless you like golf there's nothing to do except pool. The resort is set in the middle of canyon which felt like being in the bottom of a bowl with only a small road to access which would not be safe for children to walk.

The cons are there is zero cell service, the dining room was very backed up and was disorganized during dinner time, the spa is much smaller than they make it out to be with not much of a quiet room and the hotel rooms are set up like camp bunks throughout the property.  Other than the happy hour location and dining room there is something lacking about the overall vibe and location of the hotel.   I think eventually they will work this stuff out, but you can certainly tell it is newer and not at the status that it should be at this price point.",February 2017,none,none,"Sean L, Manager at The Ranch at Laguna Beach, responded to this review Snathan13,  Thank you for choosing to stay with us. We appreciate the kind words and also the feedback as it is very important to our operation.   Regarding the cell service, due to the immediacy of our magnificent stone canyon walls, there are pockets on the property that have limited cell service. However, we do offer Complimentary Wi-Fi that allows compatible devices to use Wi-Fi calling and our team can help provide other solutions as well.   As for the “camp bunks,” we took the buildings down to the studs and did a complete renovation. We liked the scattered campus layout and most of our guests seem to appreciate the intimacy of the vignette groupings it creates as opposed to the standard big box hotels.   We apologize for Harvest restaurant being busy. Most restaurants in Laguna in general have a rush period and our Harvest restaurant has proven extremely popular with the locals and has become the “go to” spot for fine dining in an atmosphere where tables are generously spaced and acoustics allow for conversation.

The reviews on TripAdvisor were very good and there were many many hotels to choose from and I couldn't be happier that I decided on this one.

I was excited to try the newly renovated version and overall was very happy with my stay.  I paid for a suite and came with a party of five.

When we arrived, the bed was not made and when we called the front desk and they sent us sheets for the bed, but we had to make it ourselves!

In the Ranch's case, the cottage turns out to be a 2 story apartment in a long track building of other apartments.

We do not control all the content on third party booking sites, but do work with them to communicate as much as we can regarding our construction phase.  We also personally call each guest prior to arrival and go over the construction impact that may occur during their stay.  Again this call is made to guests who book directly through us or a travel agent, and not via a third party booking site.    We understand that our style will not be everyone’s taste. Our owners and local Laguna Beach design team have done an incredible job maintaining the history of a 50 year old property, protecting the canyon and wildness while simultaneously updating a beloved, community resort and clubhouse built in the 60s.  Guests will soon see our property featured in several design, travel and lifestyle magazines – so many do indeed find our property incredible.    The Two Bedroom Cottages got their name from the style of design which is reminiscent of the Crystal Cove Cottages many locals visited for summer staycations, also the detailing of the board-and-batten paneling and beach residential design has been one of the highlights of our hotel as guests have said they feel as if they are at their own vacation home or cottage. It has less to do with the exterior of the building however images of those are located all over our website and readily available. We do appreciate this feedback, however, and will further display the exteriors of the hotel on our website and marketing materials.  Our goal for our guests is to experience Laguna as a local. Every detail from the Sand Volleyball Court to the Palapa Bar at The Pond Pool is quirky, fun and distinctive to Laguna’s bohemian style. Again, we anticipate that it is not everyone’s taste but know that for many families and travelers it’s exactly the retreat they are looking for.

It was gorgeous, well appointed, spacious, and very relaxing.

When you made your room reservation, you were expressly told that under no circumstances was wedding photography allowed to take place anywhere on property.  We reserve that only for weddings actually occurring at our facility to protect the integrity of our wedding clientele.    Unfortunately you did not choose to adhere to our policy and proceeded to use our resort and golf course grounds to photograph your party.  Our clients who had spent months planning their special wedding with us were shocked to see another bride and groom taking photos right next to their ceremony area - within moments of taking their vows.  We had no choice but to ask your group to leave and respect the policy that had been clearly communicated to you during the reservation process. As far as your comments go regarding our facility - our resort was completely restored at incredible cost and last year and has received worldwide accolades.  Your comments about referring to our resort as a trailer park and having 1970’s era décor is simply untrue and malicious.
