We chose this hotel because it was close to our home. This Ayers property was new, clean and modern, tastefully decorated with dark woods, teal and tan/brown color scheme with Asian accents.

The desk clerk upon recognizing that we were local residents of the city offered a generous discount, which was greatly appreciated.

I chose the Ayres as I was visiting a friend down the street in Fountain Valley. Great location, with access to the 405, made for a good home base to get around SoCal.   I booked my room through Expedia and accidentally booked an accessible room that I didn't need. After the first night, the front desk was kind enough to move us to a regular room. Our room was spacious, with high ceilings and a great sofa bed for the little one. The room was immaculate. I've stayed in alot of hotels around the world and this is probably the cleanest one I've been in. I loved the soaker tub and will miss it the most!

none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very nice hotel,"Stayed 2 nights with just me and my 5 month old on the first floor close to the entrance and eating area of the hotel.   PROS:  Clean, upscale all around. Very nice rooms, large, lots of space, high ceilings. Comfortable beds and pillows, huge tub, big bathroom. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Parking is free and great, hotel conveniently located in city. Great little cantina of snacks next to the front desk.   Neutral: Pool is outside (it was too cold to use)   CONS: Smoking is allowed right outside the front entrance so if people are smoking you have to walk through their cloud to get inside; rude and gross.  Also since smoking is allowed so close to the building your AC unit if on, will suck that up and right into your room. So that was fun.

Right off of the 405 and very quiet we did not hear any Highway noise. Very friendly staff clean wonderful Hotel. Breakfast on the patio is very nice as well. My only complaint which would be the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the doors slam every time they are closed. That makes a big problem for someone trying to sleep. If you try to close them quietly they still makes a slamming noise that is just how they close.

I use the exercise room regularly - it has a couple treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes and a weight room with a exercise machine and free weights. More than sufficient for me. Never used the pool but I do see guests use it frequently.  The in house restaurant is a good option - as I’m vegetarian they fixed me some pasta that wasn’t on the menu.

Here are some highlights to point out:  1. Affordable. They even had a AAA discount. 2. Clean. Everything was new, updated, well designed and clean. 3. The restaurant downstairs had great food so we didn't even have to leave the hotel. 4. The hot tub was nice. Although the way to get to the pool entrance was very odd. 5. The beds and pillows were amazing. (And I am a snob in regards to this). 6. The hotel was easily found right off the 405 and was directly next to a police station and fire station which gave me the feeling of added security and safety.  7.

51 helpful votes,20 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Wonderful brand new hotel. Great stay,"This is the third Ayres Hotel we've stayed at in Southern California. We've previously stayed at the Seal Beach location (WONDERFUL), as well as the Costa Mesa location(Beautiful, but customer service and breakfast need improvement). And now the Fountain Valley location too. The hotel is beautiful and in pristine condition. Just as a matter of aesthetics and personal preference, We preferred the lavish European style of the Seal Beach and Costa Mesa hotels. Those lobbies are absolutely fabulous!! Fountain Valley has a distinctively Asian inspired décor, that although lovely, wasn't as appealing to us. And we did find the room to have an off odor, upon entering. I thought earthy bamboo smell, my husband thought maybe it's because it's new... either way, it wasn't necessarily",March 2014,none,none,"Dear 6boys4me,  Thank you very much for taking the time to leave a thorough review of our new hotel on TripAdvisor.

This is a brand new location and it is very very nice. The staff are all very kind and give excellent customer service. We are in a room with a King bed and a pull out leather sofa bed. The rooms are spacious and very very clean. The pool/spa and outdoor seating area are very nice. They serve a full buffet hot breakfast every morning! And it's yummy! There is also a light lunch and dinner for purchase in a dining area.  Lobby is decorated beautifully. The only thing I wish it had was room service but other than that I am loving this hotel!

Excellent location right off the I-405 and 15-20 mins from Disneyland or Huntington Beach!! We liked the location because we weren't planning on staying every day at Disney and we appreciated the low-key atmosphere after a day at the park. Since we have been to Disneyland several times before, we figured out that taking a break between days at the park helps everyone get their batteries re-charged and you also experience more of what So-Cal has to offer. The staff was amazing, the 'free' breakfast had an omelet bar, Belgian waffles and plenty of fruit, yogurt and cereal as well!  Since the property is so new, it is not crowded and everything is sparkling!
