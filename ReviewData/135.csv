Although you felt management did not provide you with solutions to your issues, we certainly did our best to try and address all of your concerns. During your stay you asked for a room that did not look onto our back building, which we did provide you with an option to move to a back building overlooking our greenbelt. This option to move was declined. Because Management knew you were not happy with your accommodations, we tried to partner with you and the exchange company (RCI) that you traded into the property with to assist you in potentially being located to another property. However, without your participation during this process we were unable to assist you further with this. Unfortunately, RCI requires the guest also be in communication during potential relocation's, which you stated you did not have the time to wait on the phone for this process. In regards to the water this was an unforeseen event that the Resort worked to repair as quickly as possible. Without warning one buildings water heater failed. This required a plumber be called and the water heater be replaced. Yes, this did require the Resort turn water off a couple times over a two day period to replace the water heater in that building, which staff called to notify each client. The water each day was turned off no more than two hours the first day and three hours the next day when the tank was replaced. Although we know this was an unfortunate inconvenience to our clients, as I am sure you can imagine, without turning the water off there is no way to replace the water heater and fix the problem. Our staff did contact everyone in that building when we were able to identify the issue and offered each guest to relocate to another room in a different building or offered them to minimally shower in another room, so each guest did not have to move all of their belongings. Many of our other clients took advantage of this offer, but your party declined.  Again, we thank you for taking the time to review your stay. We are very sorry it was not up to the standards you expected. We hope we have an opportunity to serve you and your family again in the future.

We housed all 6 of our family members easily with the very nice master bedroom, 2 twin beds that pulled down from the wall, and a couch pullout bed.  The staff was absolutely fantastic.

We walked about 3-4 blocks down to the San Clemente beach from the San Clemente Inn.  We also visited Disneyland and San Diego.

I would recommend doing this because I read reviews of others who used third party sites and had issues or paid much more than I did.

We are sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your stay with us. That said, charging a guest additional fees for cleaning their room is not a normal occurrence or something done for normal cleaning. This is only done, when an excessive amount of cleaning is necessary to prepare the room for an incoming guest. In some circumstances there are also additional fees if we are unable to rent the room for a certain amount of days due to the need for furniture, carpet, window treatment, etc cleaning especially if a third party upholstery cleaner is hired to resolve the issue. In cases where a guest is charged for additional cleaning, our staff is asked to photograph the room so that we can provide this with our backup to show the client in question.

We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the property, grounds, and our housekeeping services. In regards to your review of the Front Desk staff, it can be challenging for group reservations to be tracked properly when all reservations are booked under a single name with no guest information included for those staying in each individual room. Unfortunately, due to our policies surrounding privacy and identity security, we cannot allow a guest that is not listed on the registration card to check in for a reservation. We require the person on the reservation to be present with proper identification. If the point of contact for the group block does not provide a list of people who will be checking in for each reservation in advance and states that they intend to check in for each of the rooms and provide information of the guests staying in each room, we can only assume to follow that request. When some of your guests arrived a day earlier for one night under a separate reservation and stated that the following days would be covered under your block of rooms and paid for by you, we simply requested that we confirm with you the next day as we were told you would be checking in for all of your reservations personally. Your guests were never denied access or told they would be asked to check out the next morning. We simply asked that we reconfirm with you prior to extending their reservation the next day using a room from your group block.  It was never our intent to make your trip stressful or to offend you or any of your guests. Please feel free to discuss this with Management further by calling 949-492-6103.",none,none,none,none,none,none,237,135

We are disappointed to hear that you did not enjoy your stay, but appreciate your feedback.  The San Clemente Inn rooms, as you mentioned, have individual A/C units not central air. This is commonly found in older properties. That said, although we are considered to be an older property we strive to keep our grounds and rooms well maintained and are consistently undergoing renovations to improve the property. The San Clemente Inn has a long presence within the community and is considered a staple to San Clemente locals.  We were also disappointed to hear that you felt you received poor service from Management. If this was the impression you were given it certainly was not our intent. The Management team strives to work with our guests in any situation in which they may be dissatisfied to provide a quick resolution to the issue at hand. Unfortunately, Management does not have the ability to purchase personal items for guests for the rooms. However, we do try to find alternative resolutions that will work for our guests in situations such as the one you encountered. We regret that Management was not able to address the manner in a way you felt appropriate.  Again, we thank you for staying at the San Clemente Inn and for taking the time to review your stay.

In regards to your statements about Groupon, the resort does do four sales a year with them, however, we are also listed on many other sites such as Expedia, Orbitz, and Booking.com. Guests are also welcome to call the resort directly to reserve or go on our website. In addition, as you stated we did have signs up around the property reminding our guests to place their parking pass on the dash of their car. These signs were only up for the week of Fourth of July. Unfortunately, due to our proximity to the beach, we do encounter a significant amount of traffic from beach goers who are not staying at the resort, but try to park in our lot. This is especially prevalent during Summer holidays. Therefore, we do everything we can to remind our guests to make sure their pass is visible, to avoid accidental towing.

If you do choose to stay with us in the future, please ask the morning of departure if a later check out is available.

Our three boys enjoy the ammenities found here.  Each year there has been upgrades that we've seen, such as the rooms and Adele's restuarant!  The San Clemente State Beach is a short walk and the City of San Clemente is what a beach town should be in So Cal!

Uphill on the way back, or drive down to the metered parking (bring your quarters) $1/hr.  There are very few units with an Ocean view, these are on the third level of the North Rear building.  The rear units have  nice views of the manicured grounds to the West.  Be warned that the units at the front of the complex, adjacent to the parking lot, have absolutely no view.  They look directly into the rear building about 20 ft off your balcony!  The common areas can be quite noisy with family reunions and parties in the adjacent rooms.  The bedroom faces the noisy walkway with people constantly walking by. Request a room away from the stairs and Bring your earplugs!

The inn is an older location but makes up for it with a bunch of amenities such as two spas, pool, recreation room and the ability to check out a variety of games, shuffleboard, and more.  The rooms are nice with a kitchenette and full refrigerator which helped us with our little one and all of his food.  Its nothing too fancy but works for the price of the room.  Finally, the location is just up the hill from the San Clemente Beach which was a nice beach minus the petroleum in the water which sticks to your skin...  Free Wi-Fi is also a plus as it allows me to write this review!  :-)",May 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,647,135

Clean, well maintained property, almost full kitchen, (no oven).  Large rooms, sparkling clean pools, great weather year-round.

The rooms have all that you need although they are not luxurious by any means.  Good bed, 2 TVs, kitchen, morning paper, etc.   Location between SD and LA is good, but I'd go South if choosing.  Traffic north to LA is poor any time of the day.  Easy access to PCH and beach towns is a big plus.    Looks like they're doing lots of renovating, so it should be even better in the future.  All of the staff people were friendly, helpful, and effecient.",April 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,649,135
8 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice location,"We stayed for a week and traveled the beaches along the Pacific Coast Highway.  It's a great location -- near a very nice beach (san clemenete beach).  The rooms aren't exactly the Ritz Carleton but they're clean and well laid out.  We liked the big balcony with view of the ocean (request it!).  Staff was very nice--they have free movies to rent and activities during the day.  Only problem we had was that it was hot at night and our AC unit didn't work well--it took us awhile to get them to fix the problem right.  Otherwise, we'd recommend it for the location -- good base for traveling north and south, price, and condition.",June 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,650,135
12 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice Place,"Our stay was very nice. the resort is locate almost in the middle between LA and San Diego. The beach is just a short walk down the hill. The suites are nice, a little small, but nice. The park is very green and was nice to walk around in. The pool area was a little small, but very clean. We have 2 small children, and they don't real have a kids area in the pool. They don't let kids in the main pool. So overall our only complant, but just a small one, was the pool area.",June 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,651,135

Just at the end of the road is a wonderful secluded beach - follow that beach all the way into town and to the pier.  The rooms were well maintained - ours had a view of the park.  We very much liked the convenience of the area with easy access to the freeways and just blocks from the downtown area.  The resort itself is very quiet with nice pool and garden area.  Its a wonderful homebase for exploring the surrounding areas - there is much to see.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,652,135
