Distance to the park: If you're walking, you're gonna be disappointed because it's pretty far in terms of the "" a couple of blocks from the park"" estimate most travel sites give you. If you have the parking pass, it's perfect, no more than a 5 minute drive with lights and intersections, you take longer to find in a spot in the garage or whatever parking area Disney decides they want to fill up first.  Food: The continental breakfast is pretty basic fare, but it's free so if you're on a budget it'll be like eating breakfast at home so plus points for that.

We asked for another room and told them we felt unsafe.  It was also located in a dark dirty corner.  The second room was much better looking,  but had a terrible smell.  The towels were dingy, the blankets smelled.  We had to go buy a blanket, just so we wouldn't use theirs.  The shower was terrible, you would either get scolded with hot water or freezing cold.  It would fluctuate during a shower.  I think anytime someone turned on water or flushed the toilet it made the water go either real hot or cold.  The location is awful.  The shuttle service had descent times to and from the hotel, but one of the reasons we chose this, was if we wanted to leave in",August 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,280,172
