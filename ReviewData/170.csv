I really enjoyed my previous stay but the hotel is not as good as it used to be.   To start with, the booking process through the Sonesta website was not easy and a little frustrating. The cheapest rates shown as available would not let me book. I had to book a more expensive rate. I proceeded with the booking as I remember the hotel and liked location and the 2 bedroom suites. I did contact customer services about this issue, they were unwilling to help.  The first impression at the hotel was very good, little had changed since my last visit, essentially the same as the old IHG hotel with the odd Sonesta logo.

The location is right between Disneyland and Angels stadium. Right by the freeway so you can be ANYWHERE in the L A area in an hour. Good pool for the kids and breakfast is definitely a money savor. Only suggestion I would have is that the pool bar does not open until 4 (which is 6 or 7 by the body clock to most) and might want to open earlier as there more adults out by pool afternoon. We had a 2 bedroom suite that had plenty of room and could relax in the living room as a family before going to bed.

So your accommodation really is just a means to an end.    You need breakfast in the morning to fuel up for a big day out, then a way to get to and from the theme park (regular bus that comes about every half hour and then takes about 15 minutes to get to the Park entry) and then a comfortable bed when you return.  And this is what you get at Staybridge. Spacious rooms, a nice pool and spa to ease the tired feet and body, full cooking facilities (there's not much in the way of restaurants in the immediate area, if that's what you are looking for - we were happy to cook some pasta and chop up some salad).

The hotel has a bus/shuttle that picks up about every 20 minutes to Disneyland, so no need to pay for parking or walk all that way.  It is very convenient, especially for large groups that would require several vehicles.  The shuttle ride is only about 10 minutes and you get dropped off right at the Park entrance.  Also, we bought our 2-day park hopper passes right at the front desk.  Saved time when we got to the Park. Another great thing about staying at Staybridge is the free breakfast.  It's not 5-star food, but definitely good enough to fuel you up in the morning before heading out the the Park.

Before the posted time of the kitchen area closing, they placed a chain across the entrance stated they were closed and baring guests from getting any food.

This is a food service violation,  and the management",June 2013,none,none,The breakfast closes promptly at 9:30am during the weekdays.  Often times guests arrive late but we still allow them to go in and grab what is still available.  Typically they will allow one or two family members go in and get food for the rest of their family.  We can’t let multiple families come into the buffet area after it has closed otherwise the staff would never be able to clean and go home on time.  We feel that three hours is more than enough time to come down and enjoy breakfast.  While staff members have taken advantage of what was left over after breakfast we never replenish items specifically for them.  I spoke with our kitchen staff and they informed me that any eggs that are on the buffet line at the close of breakfast are discarded.  The eggs that were on ice were cooked prior to the end of breakfast but were not used so they were placed on ice.  They remained covered and were cooled down to the proper temperature in accordance with local health regulations.  Typically we have between 500-700 people in-house each day during our peak season and we have not had any reports this year of guests becoming ill due to the food from breakfast or evening managers reception.  We receive surprise inspections a minimum of twice a year and have always passed.  We are very proud of the hospitality as well as the services we provide and I feel that is reflected in the outstanding reviews we have received via TripAdvisor.

No problems with plumbing or housekeeping. In fact, the housekeeping was excellent (and cleanliness is really important to me - bathrooms were always clean and nice...good/thick towels,  soft beige/gold color theme.  Liked the sink and vanity area right outside of the tub/shower & toilet area, and adjacent the bedroom.  The 2 private bedrooms with their own bathrooms are seperated by a small living room for extra space (nice to have when you're with kids), and a great kitchen/dining area for eating in!  Von's grocery store is around the block and up the road...not far, real convenient.  Laundry room was busy with only four washers and four dryers-but it's free.

Earlier negative reviews almost made us move our reservations.  We are very glad we didn't.  We found the suites to be a wonderful family gathering spot.    The facilities were very well kept, the rooms exceeded expectations.  One bedroom contained a king-size bed with a full bathroom and TV.  The other bedroom contained two full-size beds with a full bathroom and TV.  The living area had a full-size hideabed with a TV.  The kitchen had a full-size refrigerator, microwave, stove top and dishwasher with all the dishes, pots and pans.

5 helpful votes,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Rude Staff!!,I really enjoyed the rooms and locations of this hotel...it is great for families...but the service and attitude of the staff in this hotel is horrible.  We checked in over christmas holiday with our extended family.  We had requested months early that the rooms be joined or on the same floor.  When we checked in we had our rooms spread out the hotel on many different floors...not one of us were on the same floor.  The staff offered no apology...just said they are busy.  When we had billing problems...all that was offered was that we could leave the hotel if we are not happy.

We shopped for food at Von's which is a regular grocery store about a $7 cab ride away. Ate breakfast at the buffet. Wasn't absolutely fantastic, but perfectly adequate. Fair bit of variety. Kids can eat at separate times. Took lunches to Disneyland in pack. Food very expensive (and crappy) in Disneyland/California/Universal Studios.  Fair amount of storage space in room.

I felt good about it until I read some of the Trip Advisor reviews. Then I got a little nervous because they were pretty mixed. Yet, I'm happy to report my concerns were unfounded. We were pleasantly surprised. We can't think of a single negative thing to say. We had a great time and would gladly go there again. Our room was very clean, comfortable, and attractively decorated. It was awesome to get up in the morning and have breakfast right there and ready, (a great bonus with young children).

Sofabed not only wasn't comfy, it wasn't clean. The blanket had crusty stuff that looked like vomit on it. Complained to the front desk, after almost an hour the dropped off a new blanket but didn't take the old one away, and didn't change the sheets on the sofabed which obviously weren't changed from the last guests.

The breakfasts are not 4 star material but still I did not pay for a 4 star breakfast. We arrived a day earlier than planned, and the management was very accomadating in getting us a room.

We loved the full kitchen and it was very helpful when dealing with small children, however the refrigerator leaked several cups of water all over our food every day.  The TV in the main room was not working well. We reported this to the fornt desk but no one ever came to fix it. The fold away sofa in the living area was so horrible I was embarassed that my brother who came for a few days had to sleep on it. He ended up sleeping on the floor with some blankets.
