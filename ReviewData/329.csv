I blame Expedia for not letting me know that there is only one bed (queen or king) in the room, ESPECIALLY after telling the agent we were bringing our 5-yr-old grandson. We did not find out until arrival about the sleeping arrangements.  Kudos are given to the staff member who tried very hard to help us out, and although we agreed to it then, it was not truly acceptable. We had arrived early, our king-sized room was not ready.

The motel is located very close to Pacific Coast Highway, so guests at the Oceanview Motel have to put up with traffic noise all night and all day.  And except for a few rooms on third and maybe the second floor of the motel, the homes on the beach side of PCH block the view of the ocean.    However, my wife and I found the traffic noise to be ""white noise"" that didn't interrupt our sleep.  And for the price we paid - $50 a night including tax - we didn't really expect an ocean view.
