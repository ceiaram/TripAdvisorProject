Parking was really good. When you first walk in you smell the cleaning products used. For the price might not be a issues for some. Personally I’d paid the extra 40 not to deal with it again. Unfortunately for me when I got to the room it had some issues. No Wi-Fi, was told it didn’t reach all rooms. One of my  TVs did not  work and they never sent anyone to fix it. They had leaks and power issues and didn’t communicate or apologize for any inconvenience I experienced. The walls and floor mold needs a lot of TLC. Didn’t have the mattresses zipped in protective cases, mattress was filthy, luckily Walmart and Target is close bought our own sleeping stuff.

No visitor policy and if you do they want to charge $20 for each day you have a visitor and then if you check out past 11am they will charge $15 per hour. There was mold in the room the toilet top didnt fit the tank, walls were all patched up. If you have kids don't bring them here, they could get sick from anything, the walls, mold or sticky carpet. And if you're from out of town and have family in Anaheim remember they CANNOT visit you there at the motel.  Unfortunately we had already paid for a week 287.50 and ended up stuck here plus they wanted a $50 cash deposit and didnt want to give a receipt so they basically want you to hand over cash money and not give any",October 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,39,59

When we went up to our room it smelled like cigarette smoke and pot. The air was damp and hot and smelled like filth and drugs. We asked to be moved, but they only put us in the room next door, and, of course, still smelled like smoke. The inside of both rooms were filthy! Stains everywhere and a crust of oil, dirt and sludge on every fabric surface. There were unfinished corners and wood trim and weird pipes sticking put of the walls. We wanted to make tea, but the coffee pot was missing the pot. The number buttons were torn out of the phone. We were exhausted and slept anyways. The bed was rock hard and i could feel every spring in my back. The bed was stained",September 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,40,59

We had travel issues and they helped us no end, use of their phone and suggested further travel help. We stayed 2 nights to go to Disneyland with 12yr child. Location good,$15 taxi each way. Price for motel cheap for area. It was older, but we had a good room upstairs, 2 queen beds, very adequate. A pool too, nice after a long day.",July 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,41,59

We get to hotel and they say we booked only for 2 people and wanted to charge us an extra 200 for my parents to stay in my room. Then the guy was so rude and yelling at us making it seem like we were scamming him and after all was said and done they had to get another room next to us and we get inside our room and it is so Big plenty of room for all of us. The rooms are old and not kept up with you can tell they don't care all they want is your money , you have to pay for ice which is the craziest thing I ever heard of and the beds are like sleeping on a concrete slab.

It was WAY further away from Disnelyland than we thought, and is in great need of regular maintenance and lots of repair. I had ahard time not wanting to wash my hands after touching the stairwell rail. No room anywhere else so we made the best of it. My friend was charged $93 per night thru AARP online. Definitely NOT worth it!",March 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,43,59

This room was very large and well kept! The only thing I was curious about was why they didn't come in and make the beds after we left for the day??? Other than that, it was a very comfortable place to stay and well worth the money! I would stay there again.",July 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,44,59
5 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,I should of postponed my trip for a better hotel,Our family stayed at this hotel because the one we usually stay at was booked.  The beds were hard as a rock..The laundry room was dissssgusting..coin operated and dirty..looks as if it has never been cleaned..our room was upstairs and we asked if we could have a down stairs room and we were told no...too many people live in the hotel. People smoking weed in the room next to us. The maid forgot to give us towels and blankets for our bed. They double charged my card and I didn't find out until the day before we were leaving. They didn't believe me and told me i was lying.  i had to get my laptop and show them my account and the double charge.  they said the money would be back on my card in 15 minutes..it took 3-10 days.  we ended up having to have money wired to us so we could,March 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,45,59
4 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Do not stay there!,"I went here because it was close to Disneyland.  Pictures online looked amazing.  We got inside and it was terrible!  The bed hurt my back, there was gum on the headboard.  The couch was ripped open with nasty stains on it.  They had a small desk and the chair had brown stains all over it.  The hot water took 30 mins to get warm because they said their pipes were bad.  They refused to get us a different room.  The coffee table was  garbage.  Then they gave us less then half a roll of toilet paper, course we ran out and nobody was in the office.  I will never go back!!!",February 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,46,59

Don't think I'm exagerating THE BED WAS             THE WORST IV EVER SLEPT ON. I didn't sleep at all. Try the towels they have hanging, I dare you. The cooler smelled horrible when you turn it on. Wear black socks, Any other color turns black anyway....the headboard has stains on it........and there are smeary brown stains around the toilet area, not IN the toilet bowl, around the toilet itself, on the lower walls. There was only one open outlet and it was broken, we could only charge one phone At a time or both phones and not watch tv....and the ice machine was COIN OPPERATED!!!!! please believe me when I say that this place will upset you if you stay here.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,47,59
