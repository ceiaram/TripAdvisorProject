The hotel is currently under slight renovations so this won't be a factor to anyone who's staying after June. Now for the positive. The staff could not be more accommodating and friendly.

I paid $156 a night (tax included) for a room for two with a king sized bed. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were terrible. The towels in the bathroom are really coarse, leading me to believe that they were old and had been washed many times in harsh detergent. An investment in new towels and pillows would go a long way in improving the rooms. One other thing that bothered me was housekeeping. I had a candy bar our first night here and left the wrapper on the night stand. It was still there when I got back the next evening. They didn't change the sheets and instead just made the bed.
