Near a freeway, but not overly close to the center of town if you are walking as I did. Freeway noise was surprisingly not the issue I expected it to be, however neighbor-noise was. Went to sleep around 9PM. At ~10PM the people above us arrived. They stomped, dropped heavy objects, made tapping sounds, were running back and forth (?) and sounding like they were dismantling their room. We kept expecting it to end but after 45 minutes I called the desk to complain. Staff said she'd take care of it.

While your hotel technically met these requirements I was disappointed and unsettled by the arrest that was made one night in the room next to mine. The officers took the better part of an hour dealing with the situation, keeping me awake and very uneasy for the rest of the night. I am very grateful to the police force for upholding their duty but the whole night made me feel extremely vulnerable and not at all safe as a single woman staying at the hotel.
