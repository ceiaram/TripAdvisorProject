Pros: The hotel is well located, with a 15-minute walk door to security. The rooms are spacious and modern. The elevator is conveniently fast, and has the added security of needing room keys, which is nice. There is a CVS downstairs and a Walgreens across the street. The staff was welcoming.

In the middle of the night when additional staff is not readily available, we do use our security as an extension of ourselves to assist with housekeeping requests, maintenance requests, and the occasional rare room move.  When transferring a guest to a new room location, we like to send an employee to ensure that the guest is able to gain access to their old room and to be readily available should they need any help with luggage or further communication with our front desk.  It can be very frustrating for a guest who needs to get back into the old room because they forgot an item and their keys have already been timed out within minutes due to the transfer.  Normally we only have one security guard at a time but we were also introducing a new security guard to the team that evening and they were shadowing the other officer for training purposes. We are sorry if their uniform made you feel like they were not there to ensure that you made it to your new room location comfortably.  We have never had a guest in the past feel this way about our security staff but we will bring it up to their supervisors to make sure there is no miscommunication like this in the future.  I hope this helped clear up some of the concerns you had with our security staff that night. Kind Regards, Lisa D., Operations",none,none,none,none,none,none,331,227

We are very sorry to hear about the issues you encountered.  Our hotel is currently being repainted on the outside of the property.  We do try our very hardest to make sure that the painting of property is done in times when it’s most convenient for guests and we are looking forward to the fresh look of our hotel once it is completed.  We have also relayed your feedback regarding housekeeping to the department manager and we really appreciate that you brought it to our attention.  During major conventions like Vidcon that sell out the Anaheim Resort, self parking can get full at times.  This is why we’ve made self parking and Valet parking the same cost; to try and alleviate our guests of any stress of finding a parking space, especially during the busy summer season and during major conventions.    We’re very glad that you were able to partake in our breakfast buffet during your stay.  We have worked very hard trying to offer a wide variety of options for our breakfast items.  We also pride ourselves on the view of the fireworks from Disneyland up by the pool area.  We are glad you got up there in time for the fireworks show.

We understand these rooms are very popular with families that have young children and age and size can definitely affect an accommodation experience.

We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the size and layout of the room and that you found your beds to be comfortable.  Please accept our apologies in regards to the poor experience you had due to the noise from the guests above you.  As a hotel that caters to families heading to the Disneyland Resort, we do have insulation throughout the rooms and we actually do not get noise complaints often between guest rooms.  Please never hesitate to speak with the front desk should your travels be negatively affected by noise such as this.  We do take these issues very seriously and we do ask that our guests be considerate to those around them and below them.  We are also sorry to find that there were also some maintenance issues in the room regarding the loose shower handle.  Again, we sincerely apologize and have informed the engineering staff so that it may be remedied as soon as possible. During our busy leisure season our complimentary breakfast buffet area can get heavily impacted especially towards the end of the buffet hours.  Most businessmen and guests that head down earlier in the morning tend to experience the buffet in a quieter setting which we attempt to inform our guests at check-in so those that may not welcome the morning bustle can avoid it by heading down a little bit earlier.  I will make sure to remind the front desk staff to inform our guests of this in case this was not mentioned at your check-in. Because of our close proximity to the resort and the impact of parking in the general area, hotels within the Anaheim Resort do charge for parking.  Our parking is $14 a night plus tax and in comparison to the surrounding properties within walking distance to Disneyland and the convention center, we are actually on the lower end of the parking fee spectrum.  If you were misinformed in any way by your travel agent or a call center, we apologize.  We attempt to do our best to be as up front as possible with the parking fee on our websites, with their call center and at the front desk.

First, I would like to take a moment to address your concerns about our linens by giving you a little background on our linens and the detergents used to clean them, as reports of this type are rare.  Please be assured that we use the Marriott brand specified linens and that our laundry solutions are commonly used in hotels and come from Marriott's main supplier whose technicians regularly service, test and calibrate the equipment.  I would encourage you to report adverse reactions to anything in our facilities right away so that we can properly investigate and determine the root cause.  As to parking, we do have a limited number of spaces until the main parking garage for this complex is completed next year.  In the meantime, we are offering 24-hour valet service at no additional charge to make this process smoother and more efficient.  Finally, for the breakfast buffet, we do review both our offerings and hours of operation regularly.  We have made adjustments in the past and will undoubtedly do so again in the future based upon the needs of our guests.  On most weekdays for instance, we have found that the majority of guests come down to breakfast between 8:00-9:00, following the patterns of the theme parks, regardless of our posted hours.

I am disappointed to hear about the issues that you encountered.  With regards to parking upon your arrival, we offer valet parking during our busiest peak times, such as over Spring Break or high convention dates, in order to speed up service as there can be a great many guests arriving and departing at the same time.  I am sorry that this seems to have had the opposite affect in your situation.  During off peak times, we offer self parking, which is what I believe is at the heart of the seemingly conflicting messages.  I will share your feedback with my team so that we can learn from it and make improvements going forward.  As you have noted, the lobby can be very busy at times.  Given our close proximity to Disneyland and the Anaheim Convention Center, guests who are heading to the park or to a convention tend to all come down to the lobby for breakfast during the same small window of time, which can make keeping everything in perfect order a bit of a challenge.  As we have only been open a short amount of time, we are still fine-tuning our processes and procedures as well as looking at adjusting our equipment and the layout of the lobby to better serve our customers during all hours of the day.    Despite these challenges, I am glad to hear that you were happy with the cleanliness of your room.    Our housekeeping team takes pride in the important job they do everyday.  I will be sure to pass on your positive message in this area to them.    Thank you again for sharing your experience with us.
