I mentioned to you that I couldn’t process your card and would do it on the day of arrival.  Then you said you had contacted Hotels.com two days prior because you found a lower rate on booking.com but hadn’t heard back from hotels.com.

First you say you don't know who you booked through, and then you say you contacted hotels.com after you found a lower rate on booking.com?   I went on my website and told you what my rates were.  I offered to honor what you found on booking.com if you sent me that screenshot.  You then asked about what type of accommodations you had booked, so I sent you photos.

Here are my responses to some of the red flag lies in the review:  1.	Always Inn cannot accommodate four guests in a room. Our maximum occupancy is three and is posted on every partner website. If guests come with more than three guests, I offer them an upgrade to my two-bedroom, two-bath Always San Clemente Beach Rentals. 2.	We do not have a “pull out couch: in any of our inn rooms. We subscribe to a regular Terminex service, so there definitely would NOT be roaches, dead or otherwise, at our inn. 3.	We do not serve hotdogs for breakfast, ever! I have purchased Angus beef hot dogs for my neighbor’s two dogs. 4.	We send out a lengthy email to each guest letting them know their room name and location, where to park, etc.  We have three clearly designated parking spaces on site.  5.	We do not have any metal racks with onions, veggies, etc. in the hallway.  Never have, never will. 6.	Each guest room is cleaned using a 27 item checklist prior to guest arrival. 7.	Our stellar reviews from guests who truly HAVE stayed at Always Inn speak for themselves.

There are breakfasts to convert any coffee-only late riser, local expertise and sight-seeing suggestions -- and that fireplace.

You are within walking distance of shopping, food and best of all the beach.  During our stay, we enjoyed the recommendations of the Inn Keepers.  Trust me, they know what they are talking about.  Breakfast was wonderful as you get to enjoy it outside while the town is still waking up.  Always Inn is very beautiful and has a lot to offer.  This was our first time doing a B&B and it will not be our last.  We will come back and stay again at Always Inn.  The only thing I would say to watch out for is if you park in their driveway.  Make sure you pull all the way forward, my boyfriend let the back of my truck hang out in the sidewalk and we got a ticket.  LOL.  Overall, very relaxing but plenty to do.

They are dog friendly so we (hesitantly) brought our two Golden Retrievers with us. We went to dinner and the Innkeepers offered to sit wih our dogs. When we returned several hours later, the dogs ignored us! Craig and Sonia, the innkeepers took them out for a walk and played with them until we got back. At the end of our stay, none of us wanted to leave. We all fell in love with the Inn and the Innkeepers.  It is right in the middle of downtown San Clemente,with wonderful stores to shop, The rooms are spacious and clean and they serve the most fantastic breakfast I have ever eaten. In the evenings, we sit around the fireplace with our hosts, sip wine and and have a great time.

Craig and Sonia are the newer (since the end of 08' if I remember correctly) property managers and are doing an excellent job of running the place. Unfortunately Sonia was on a personal trip so we did not get to meet her but Craig took great care of us. We stayed in the ""Palm Whisper"" room which was just big enough for the two of us. Comfortable bed, nice flat screen with a very nice selection of DVDs to watch if there was nothing on TV. They had several patios to relax on and have breakfast on, if you so choose.

1 helpful vote,5 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great romantic getaway,"What a great place for a romantic getaway. The house sits as a garden oaisis on what would otherwise be a lonely corner. A short walk up the slightly winding brick and stone walkway with gardens to each side leads you to the front door. The first thing that I said when I walked into the rather eclectically furnished front room was ""Honey, I'm home"". This place gives you a warm comfortable feeling. This tone matches the owners personalities as well, very friendly and down to earth. Our room was a bit on the small side, but there are at least two other rooms available, one larger, and another very large but the semi-private patio and lush gardens more than make up for it. We were treated to a full breakfast on both mornings of our stay. We could have eaten in the dining room, but",October 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,196,345

Not that I didn't have a nice stay the first time around, especially with breakfast made by the owner herself.

We showed up at 3:00pm (check-in time) for our check-in and waited an hour in the ""lobby"" (living room of their house) for them--no one around. Finally got a call back an hour later, and received directions to the studio apt. (off-site, a mile or so from inn, in a residential neighborhood a ways from main downtown area--not scenic), where the key was under the mat. The studio was just fine and well stocked with everything you need. Not in the most picturesque neighborhood, but it was just fine. No complaints.  The rooms in the ""Inn"" are just fine, but it's not like any B&B I've ever been to--really feels like someone's house and a little too close quarters for it to be all that comfortable.

If their idea of a Spanish and Tuscany style resort is a wood lap sided, asphalt shingled roof rental triplex nestled within a major rental district then the local Pizza Hut is authentic Italian food.  The picture on the internet is that of a ""resort"" that doesn't exist however the room photos are correct.  Again, the photo does not match the actual building.  What is with the Beach Club photos?

The bed and Breakfast is a 5 bedroom house, of which Frida, the owner, rents out three of the bedrooms.  The hotel is about 1 block from Del Mar, which is the main street in San Clemente, and about 4 blocks from the Beach.  Frida is a very sweet lady with eclectic tastes that suit her abode.  She does not lock her doors, but San Clemente is little SoCal beach town, and at first might be strange, but becomes refreshing when you think about it.  Your room does have a key though.
