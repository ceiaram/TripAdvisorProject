Over the years one thing has proven consistent: the amenities continue to shrink...,and the service continues to deteriorate. I remember when daily maid service was provided. Now there is none unless you pay a steep price for it. I remember when the shuttle took you to the local Trader Joe's. Not anymore. I remember when the staff were there for more than a few months. I recognized no one from previous stays. I remember when a full service kitchen was provided. Now place mats are 'on request' as are shower amenities since what's provided would not be enough to wash a cat. Early checkin? Good luck. Being encouraged with a few useless Marriott Bonvoy points to check out early? Absolutely. Noise from the loud cars speeding up and down the highways a constant din.

There are about 700 flats, not just rooms, in the many buildings and easy parking outside each. Why do I point this out? Well, if you search the well-known  websites it's sometimes difficult to understand that you're getting a two- bedroomed flat with a livingroom and a diningroom area with a large table and a fully equipped kitchen with tea and coffee.  A balcony and two bathrooms ensuite. And if need be, the sofa in the livingroom may be turned into a double bed. So a flat easily sleeps six. And then the price isn't too bad.

Any time of day there were only a few residents at pool.   Tip 2: sadly took me a few days to figure this one out but I didn’t need to take Toll road out of villa each day.

The villas are really spacious with wonderful views of the coast.  One negative is the lack of a fine dining onsite restauarant but there are many a short drive away.  The shop onsite is also very expensive - only buy there if it's an emergency!  Concierge is great and so helpful but one thing they don't mention that we would recommend is a day trip to LA as independent travellers. Irvine Amtrak rail station is only 13 miles away and an easy 25 minute drive from the resort.  Great free parking at the station and only $18 each way to LA.  In just over an hour you arrive at the beautiful historic Union Station.  From there it's easy to get to lots of great sights in the Downtown area.

The view is magnificent, the location of the resort is fantastic.  The good news stops there.  It feels like the furnishings have not been updated in many years.  I'm sure that they are the same as when we last visited.  But now they are old, tired, saggy and, in some cases, threadbare.  The cabinets in the kitchen are old and do not close.

Multiple villas and several pools.  Ask for a renovated room, near the main pool with ocean views and a higher up floor.  We are owners in Orlando and usually we are accommodated. Tonnes of on site activities if you are interested.  This place might be too big for some and it doesn't have a full service restaurant.  Like many vacation club properties, renting a car would probably be helpful.  This resort and grounds are very well maintained.  It was at capacity the week we were there and it did not seem crowded.    It's fairly close to Disney if you are so inclined.  Close to Newport beach and Balboa Island.

9 helpful votes,21 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Short Holiday,Came out on a Marriott promotion on our way to San Diego. We try to avoid promotions as you never get a good room. This time was no exception. The first room was in a building without an elevator and the room was down two long flights. It had a dehumidifier running on the counter full of water. The second room was in a renovated building and lovely. Still no view but it is a promotion however we are owners at another property. If Marriott really wants us to increase our level then give us a good room with no hassles. When I am trying to sell someone something I treat them like royalty.

We also had a smaller pool right next to the building which had an equally gorgeous view and was very convenient.   The condos were nice and well laid out.

However,  the size of the property is its own worst enemy. To get to the pools, hot tub (and Lobby) from the building where we stayed, one must either walk or wait for a shuttle ride. Its easily 200 yards down a hill from this building. I don't know... I like a smaller property. We can hear footsteps in the room above us and when the air-conditioning kicks on it sounds like a washing machine during the spin cycle.

The resort is beautifully designed, with comfortable, fresh, two bedroom villas many (but not all) of which have great views of the hills or Pacific Ocean.  The landscaping is beautiful and there are several large pools in the complex for you to enjoy.    But by far the greatest attraction is its proximity to the Newport Coast.  Situated on the lower part of a large hill rising from the Pacific, the resort is about a five minute walk from Crystal Cove State park, one of the largest stretches of natural beach in California.  The beach stretches for miles and there's tide pools you can explore and great sand beaches for the kids to play in.

I requested both a room with a view and a unit on a high floor (to help ensure a good view), but got neither.  Instead, first floor by the resort entrance.  It seems obvious to me they allocate the more desirable rooms for those in the Marriott time-share program.  We rented thru Expedia.

I say the Resort is good, not quite as great as some of the others, but still recommend it.  Bar area is a bit too small around the main pool.  We did have a good room location and we could see fireworks from where we were staying which was great.  I would rate the rooms as very good.  2 bed/2bath is nice when you have young kids.  The beaches though were really fun.  Waves are larger than in Gulf of Mexico and the kids just thought that was a blast.

As is often the case you are at the mercy of chance in getting your villa assignment.  As owners, we have been very lucky when staying at other MVCI locations (Hawaii/Tahoe/Myrtle Beach), but that was not the case here.

That amounts to about $21,000 a year in charges per unit exluding real estate taxes. That is where Marriott is making their large profit margin - they get $21000 a year, every year, for each unit.
