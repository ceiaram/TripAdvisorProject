41 helpful votes,75 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good experience to updated room,"The hotel has had a makeover. From the outside you might be afraid to walk in, but is actually is a nice room. Large,roomy and clean. The people at the front desk are very nice. The only complaints are, only 2 bath towels in the room and that there was no shampoo!?!? I have never stay in any motel/hotel that did not get shampoo. LOL. The area is pretty nice. I felt safe and secure. The bed was comfortable and they have a lot of channels on the TV. The price was right for a busy weekend compared to the other hotels in the area.",July 2018,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,379

4 helpful votes,9 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Modern rooms for the most part but severe parking issues,"Stayed here 5 nights with my wife and a friend while visiting Disneyland and Knotts Berry Farm.  Let's start with the room. The rooms at this motel have the new modern Motel 6 look with the green/gray colors and faux wood floors. The first room we were given had a bad lock on the door that wouldnt work and the second latch lock was missing. Luckily, I asked if there was another room available and was able to move. This room had a working lock and latch. The room itself was clean. Drapes had some holes in them, and it appears someone had broke the lock on the bathroom door at some point. The door was pretty beat up and the metal cover was missing from the lock. Not a big deal though. I am assuming this room was vacant for a while as there was a daddy long legs spider living in",June 2016,Don't get here late during the busy season or you wont be able to park.,Traveled with friends,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,4,379
1 helpful vote,11 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"""IMPRESSED NONETHELESS""","Studio 6 is a great hotel...the reviews do not reveal the great interiors of the facility. The rooms are clean, comfy and cozy. The beds will take you to dreamland like magic. I slept very well and in some cases over relaxed. I got a lot of work done with the free wifi service and managed to get in some tv time also. The housekeeping staff is very courteous and will keep you stocked with towels, soap and whatever necessities you need. Ask for Rosalinda. She is quite a peach and does her job to perfection. The housekeeping staff will check on you everyday to tidy up your room and restock it. This is probably the first hotel i have felt okay with to walk around on the laminated wood floors barefoot. Another benefit of this area everyone fails to mention is that the food trucks",June 2016,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the hard work the employees put into maintaining...,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,379
5 helpful votes,11 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great for the Price,We found this on a holiday weekend. We were surprised at the price and availability for the holiday. Staff was very helpful and room was very nice. Loved the location and didn't realize we had a kitchenette until we entered the room. It was very crowded due to the holiday weekend so parking was not good at all. Otherwise it was a great room with good service.

90 helpful votes,129 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Surprisingly Impressed,"I read the other reviews before booking, and have to agree - the exterior appearance of the Studio 6 is ""tired"".  But the other reviews were also correct - my one-king room was clean, orderly, and comfortable.  And i mean CLEAN: the sleeping/table area, the bathroom, and the kitchen were all orderly and spotless.  The platform-type bed was comfortable.  The furniture looked new, the cable TV had channels galore.  Although I only stayed one night/left early in the AM, and only used the refrigerator (5-foot size), the kitchenette was well stocked.  I would have had no trouble fixing breakfast or lunch.  And the bathroom was better tended then many more upscale places I have stayed.  The room was quiet - no neighbor noises (next door was occupied), maybe a little traffic noise",April 2016,none,Traveled solo,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,8,379

5 helpful votes,3 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Some good, some bad","First, the good - recently updated rooms with a mini kitchen, and the convenient location made a good home base for our stay in the LA area.  The bad - as other reviewers here and elsewhere on the web have pointed out, there are far too many inconsiderate people hanging around in the parking lot and outside the rooms at all hours of the night, slamming doors, laughing, yelling, and loud talking like it's the middle of the day, setting off fireworks, drinking, and who knows what else.There seems to be many long term residents who treat the common area like its their own front yard, including dragging furniture out of the rooms to sit around outside at night, hang out, and call down at each other from the balcony walkway. Our neighbors were right outside our door every night, loud",July 2014,none,Traveled with family,"Dear Jso R,  Thank you for your Review of our property it is much appreciated.

The beds and blankets were very clean, I didn't need to use my own linens. The towels were clean and new. Great kitchenette and restroom. The shower can double as an exfoliator, it felt great after a day at the beach.  The only thing that bothered me was that there are so many people in the parking lot and hanging around at night. There were also loud music and laughter at 3am. It was still better than the neighboring hotel",July 2014,none,none,"Dear Vcastlara,  Thank you for your Kind review.

10 helpful votes,18 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Never Again,"i know when you book at a Motel 6/Studio 6 you don't expect much. That's what happened. As soon as we pulled in to the motel, my wife got nervous because the outside of the building was outdated and dirty. The complex was empty which was okay. Check-in was easy and quick.  When we walked into our room we were amazed. It was nice, The room was perfect for what we needed. it looked just like the photos. except the room never cooled down comfortably because there is a floor A/C unit. The bed sucks!! didn't get a good nights rest the whole time. we didn't use the kitchen part. The bathroom was okay the towel rack fell off the first day and the maid just left it on the ground. There was molding and light-switch covers missing. I was asked at check-in if we wanted Housekeeping",May 2014,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,13,379
