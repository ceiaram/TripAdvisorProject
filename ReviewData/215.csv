The rooms at Hyatt House are perfect, and the amenities the hotel offers are great. Breakfast, clean hotel, lots of space, and great rooms. I think the main issue with the hotel is just make sure that this fits your trip. First, you may not necessarily need the amenities that Hyatt House provides. For example, the full kitchen, island/desk. Second, the location may not be ideal for you. The beaches are still a bit of a trek via ride share/your own car, and some of the entertainment in the area (Disney/Angels/etc.) is a bit far compared to other hotels.
