We understand that one of the wonders of yoga is that there are wonderful and different ways to teaching yoga. Obviously my approach is not for you.  We do however have to answer some of your complaints.  Your first complaint was about herbal laxatives.  We do have them available along with other herbs and plants that are helpful during the cleansing process. We do not push them on anyone for weight loss. Just like with any diet, the colon does get backed up and most people find an herbal laxative helpful.    I would like to mention that Katresha, my wife, is always lovely - just not to make up for my abruptness.  The week you were here four of the seven people were returnees.  They loved their week retreat and have since returned again.  One lady did leave on Thursday, completing a five-day retreat (which we also offer) rather than a seven-day retreat.   Concerning our yoga, we are very firm about certain things.  We address these on the very first morning that you are here.  Everyone is different and at The Pearl Laguna, we stress moving the pose to the body, not the body to the pose.  We believe that the perfect pose is where the body goes naturally today, not what is in some yoga book.  To me the strongest pose in yoga is the Madonna gesture. The whole week is built around you standing strongly on your path, arms to the side, palms up facing the front with a fearless, wide, open heart.  Unlike most yoga teachers we understand that most people are hurt in yoga doing forward bends. So we protect the back by insisting that you do not come up or go down with a rounded back.  We understand that if you bend your knees and sit back, keeping a flat back until your belly touches your thighs, then roll forward into the forward bend, it is helpful. When you come out of the forward bend - you bend your knees, sit back, raise your head first so that your back muscles activate and flatten your back and after that you will never hurt your back.  Also, there will be a secondary benefit of strengthening the back, thighs and buns.   We feel that most people injury their shoulders during Chaturanga (or a push up in the gym) because it is not done properly.  Most people should use their knees. Their elbows should be tight to the side of their bodies with their shoulders back and down.   Their chin should be furthest from the ground and they should only drop down to 90 degrees on their arms.  Our yoga is specifically designed to aid our program and to compensate for three hours a day of hiking in the hills.  We do Power Yoga in the AM to wake you up and get things going.  We do gentle yoga at night to bring you down.  Our program is built on positive, loving energy.  If you didn’t feel that, I’m sorry.  Geo",none,none,none,none,none,none,37,423
