The rooms are larger than most hotel rooms, which is great for families. There's a big closet for storing luggage, too. Rooms were clean, comfortable, and had the basics.

The rooms are small, but we did not use it for anything other than sleeping and bathing and it was perfectly fine. The sofa bed was very helpful for us as our two kids are used to not sharing a bed. If you have kids that can share a bed, you can easily sleep 4 kids and 2 adults using the 2 queen beds and the sofa bed. We requested service one of the 4 days.   We used the pool one afternoon, it was clearly used a lot and I could see people thinking it was dirty. We were not here for the pool, so it was fine.   The breakfast was fine. Simple, but it worked for us. Same thing every morning and enough to get us through the morning at Disney.  Parking is $20 per night at this hotel.  Getting to Disney is a trek.

Location is excellent as the park is literally down the street from the hotel.   Giving 4 stars because:  1) the AC works too well. If you set it to even 72 or 73 your room will be an igloo in about 5 minutes. But if you turn it off then the room gets too stuffy. I spoke with other members of my party an ALL of their ACs had this same issue   2) calling the front desk proved to be a tedious chore at times. Many times the phone would ring and ring or we would be placed on hold than hung up on. Had to follow up an hour after an initial request for some items to be brought up.

The rooms were comfortable and clean, pool was a nice respite from Disney chaos, parking was easy, wifi reliable and breakfast was pretty good! Overall, we had a great time. My only negative comment is that the walk from hotel to the tram is too far for my four-year old, especially after a long day at Disneyland. We ended up driving and paying for parking at the Mickey Mouse parkade after the first day. Uber/Lyft would be an inexpensive alternative except we would require a booster seat so that was not an option for us. We may do the paid shuttle from hotel door to Disneyland next time.

Our only complaint has nothing to do with the actual hotel but with the shuttle to Disney.  We bought our tickets at the hotel and took the shuttle from hotel to Disney (about a 7 min trip).  Problem was there was only one shuttle it seemed.  The wait time were horrendous, especially on the way back to hotel from Disney.  At one point there were about 50 people waiting for the shuttle which could only take so many and had to leave the remaining people behind until they took us to hotel and came back.

We care deeply about each guest’s experience and take hotel cleanliness and sanitation very seriously at our hotel. As a result, Marriott has established very strict standards of cleanliness for all of its hotels that either meet or exceed public health department regulations, including pest control. Our staff is trained to routinely inspect and monitor all areas of the hotel including guest rooms for any evidence of bed bugs in conjunction with our independent pest control company. In the rare instance that bugs are identified, our protocols call for, amongst other steps, to immediately remove that room from inventory until such time that room has been treated by our experts at the pest control company and re-inspected to ensure they have been eliminated. We understand that this issue is of great concern to our guests and are actively doing everything we can to prevent and eliminate this problem if it occurs. I would like to thank you once again for staying with us and I will be happy to discuss this matter with you further should you wish.

I didn't walk because of my babies, but I saw a lot of people leaving and returning to the hotel on foot.  Here are things I loved about this hotel: 1. It has a CVS right next to it 2. The breakfast was delicious. Without doubt, they need to keep that chef. My kids really enjoyed the food. 3. It is close to the roadside, but we did not hear any noise from our room. We booked a room facing the convention center. 4. Customer service was awesome.  What i did not like 1. The bathroom design did not work for me. Am just being picky here.

Fabulous room (although I would have preferred a higher floor and theme park view instead of right over the entrance to the hotel). We were able to a pre-check in and leave our luggage with the front desk so we could walk to a nearby place and get lunch. And the front desk clerk called us when the room was ready (right when we sat down to eat, so less than 15 minutes from the time we left). We did have to request extra towels every day, but that's not a huge deal to me. I was a little worried about breakfast every morning with everyone going down at the same time to eat before hitting the theme parks, but it worked out nicely.

But the price can be seen when you get to the room.  Lots of space.  Pull out couch bed if you have extra people.  Bathroom is very nice.  Beds are comfy.  Pool is small but good.  Small fitness center with cardio and little bit of free weights.  Walking distance to disney or you can buy a bus Pass from the hotel.  Bus pickups in the parking lot of the hotel.  Bus runs every 20 minutes until 30 minutes after park close.   If you drive here you will pay for parking per night.  It's 14 dollars a night.

We do have a large portion of rooms that do have the tub shower combination though, I apologize that you did not get one of those rooms.

Those hotels feature long walks, indescribable smells (in a bad way), and screaming kids. This hotel is on the ""back"" side of the parks, and is probably an equal distance to walk through the Disney parking garage to get on the trams. The plus side is the trams let you off in Downtown Disney by Starbucks, which we usually visit before going to the parks, so it ends up being less walking for us.

My complaint is with the design of the room we stayed in (it had 2 queens and a pull-out).  We were 3 women participating in an event at Disneyland.

If someone had to use the restroom at night, the light would shine right through the door onto the beds.

Normally we stay a bit closer to the parks; the larger Marriott near the Convention Center.  This time we opted for the Spring Hill because it's new and could accommodate five people.    LOCATION: The location isn't bad - walking an additional 1 1/2 - 2 miles isn't that bad to start the day - it's a long haul at the end of a long day of walking.  I say 1 1/2 to 2 miles because from the hotel to the parks entrance plaza...it's longer than what Google maps has for the Disneyland Resort.

We stayed here in April to go to Disneyland.  Let's get the 'name' out of the way first.  The hotel is about a mile from the entrance to Disneyland – not what I would expect with a name like “Maingate”.  There are many hotels on Harbor Blvd. that could call themselves “Maingate” since they are right across the street from Disneyland. I did not expect to walk to Disney, I doubt that many did.
