The property is centrally located in the heart of BP close to Knotts Berry Farm and more... and it‚Äôs literally a few steps next to my favorite bakery Porto‚Äôs. Although I skipped the included breakfast, decided to eat at Porto‚Äôs instead. I just couldn‚Äôt resist but I‚Äôm sure the hotel breakfast is divine! The people at the reception desk were also very attentive and kind. They all acknowledged me and my pet Max. MIKE who helped check me in at 2am made for a very good impression albeit after driving for about 8hrs. The process was expedited and he gave concise instructions and answered all my inquiries.

They were all pleasant, super nice and helpful. They helped us out with anything that we needed.   The rooms were huge and the beds super comfy.

I‚Äôll start with the good:  great location, FREE PARKING, good room layout with a separate living and bedroom, and so much potential if they invested a little money into cleaning it up.  We stayed on the 4th floor and it looks like they have been updating the rooms.  They are decent for a 3 star hotel.  The not so good:  the sleeper couch is big enough for one person.  I got the king suite thinking the kids could share the pull out couch but it wasn‚Äôt big enough.  Also, I stood in the lobby waiting to check in with 3 people behind the front desk and I wasn‚Äôt even acknowledged for almost 15 minutes.

I am aware of the situation that you faced that night and I do understand that the front desk manager went over the mistakes that were made in regards to the ""noise"" incident that was reported by the guests in the room below you. The correct procedure would have been to call your room to report to you about a noise complaint from another guest to give you a warning before security would come knocking on your door (I am also aware that he did not identify himself).   As for the huge water bug in your room, again, that was a lack of procedure on our end and that problem should have been taken care of as soon as possible when you called the front desk and there is no excuse for that. We did drop the ball on our end.   As you were made aware and experienced when you spoke to our front desk manager, Melissa, and were refunded your money for that night, all Carlson/Radisson properties have a 100% Guest Satisfction Guarantee which states the following: If you aren't satisfied with something, please let one of our staff know during your stay and we'll make it right or you won't pay. It's guaranteed.   We have noted your comments and these matters were discussed, addressed with all of our management team and the appropriate corrective training took place to prevent this from happening again! We take pride in our hotel, customer service, and attention to details to ensure our guest have the best experience here.

However, this hotel is pretty well maintained and I would say that some upgrades have been made to the bathrooms and room decor fairly recently.  The pool is very clean, with plenty of seating around the pool and pool towels are plentiful; at 10 pm sharp every night a security guard closes the pool.  The grounds are nice with lots of plants and trees but could be a little cleaner.  We were able to check in a little earlier than the 3 pm check in time.

We have noted your comments about our complimentary breakfast buffet and I am happy to announce that all breakfast meats are now available on the main buffet line which means that you no longer have to settle for the cook giving you only two peices of bacon or sausages.

The buffet breakfast is free because we want to give you a better value for your hard earned dollar.  Here is a little hint to help make the time go by just a little faster while you are waiting for your cook to order eggs. Put your egg order in first before you go to the buffet line, this which will help keep you busy and kill a little time until your eggs are ready.

It was such a far cry from what I had expected. We stayed there from November 14-21 and it was 7 nights too long.  When we walked into our suite it was so unattractive, and the sofa and armchair tired and dirty-looking, that I almost cried. THIS is where I was supposed to relax after a long day at Disneyland?  The room was dingy and never really seemed to warm up. Please do not plan to have your kids sleep on a pullout in this hotel. It's torture.  My boys, who are usually oblivious to the softness of a bed, came in to our room and said they couldn't sleep because the bed was too 'springy'.

We had a few minor complaints, but in general this is a lovely hotel and a great family value. The tropical pool/courtyard is great and it provides a nice oasis after a theme park day. The pool was well heated and my kids used it daily even on cool March days. During our stay, on a couple of nights, large high school groups stayed as guests, but the one night I voiced a complaint about noisy teens in the hall, security was sent and the problem was taken care of right away. The complimentary breakfast is great. The location is convenient to expressway, but not bothered by expressway noise. We would stay here again.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1890,206

I didn't realize that the rooms had outdoor entrances. I was on the first floor and did not feel very secure, as I was travelling alone. The furniture and bathroom fixtures were old. The lock on my door was loose and the door rattled. I ended up putting a chair in front of it.  The courtyard is very pretty and the breakfast was great. The staff were extremely nice. This is a good hotel for families with children.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1891,206

In summary, we were extremely pleased with our stay and the value of this hotel. With so many kids, we are limited to staying in hotels with suites, but have a limited budget. The room was well equipped in this price range, clean and fresh for our entire stay. All rooms face/overlook the large pool and tropical courtyard. The free made-to-order breakfast every morning (eggs, pancakes, hash browns, cereal, fruit, etc.) really made our stay that much better. The staff was friendly and helpful during our entire stay. The hotel is in a very safe and convenient location--a couple of blocks from the freeway and within a block from",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1892,206
