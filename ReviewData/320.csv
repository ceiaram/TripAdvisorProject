We stayed here so we could walk to Anaheim Stadium and save me the aggravation of parking there. It was EXTREMELY overpriced for what we got. For about the same price we could have stayed in a ""real"" hotel and driven to the game. A very bare-bones room, nothing in the ""kitchen"" (no plates, cookware, silverware, glasses, or even paper towels). No coffeemaker. Just one chair at the table, so when we brought dinner back to the room I had to stand. There was no hair dryer (a big issue for my wife)… a request at the front desk was unsuccessful.

I come back to Extended Stay feeling like I am returning to my second home.

Probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. First, we reserved a non-smoking with a king bed. We arrived to find we had been put in a ""smoking optional"" room. The only thing optional is if we wanted to breathe or not. If a chain-smoker convention was held in that room, it could not have been as smoky-smelling as this. Went down to tell them to move us and were told there were no other rooms as we had our dogs with us.  After much complaining, she ""found"" one that had two double beds. We took the room, and it still smelled funny, as if someone was smoking something they would need a medical card for. The bathroom sink was clogged and the toilet paper holder was missing.

The beds were made and we had clean towels but the toilet was filthy and no one had taken out the garbage from the last guest.  It was suppose to be a non-smoking room but there was a smoky smell that didn't get better even when we opened the windows.  There were however, two staff members that were exceptional.  The young lady that staffed the front desk in the afternoon was very friendly and the woman who cleaned our room after we complained about the dirty room was very professional.",May 2012,none,none,"I recently received a copy of your review of the Extended Stay America Orange County - Katella Ave..
