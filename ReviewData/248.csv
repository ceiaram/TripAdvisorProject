It is our standard to have rooms ready by 3 PM and we understand that missing this goal not only starts your vacation off on the wrong foot, it is a true inconvenience. We believe there may be confusion in terms of staff as we have one Maintenance Manager who does not smoke. Any staff member found smoking on this property would be immediately disciplined as we take our no-smoking policies very seriously. While we cannot control the members of our community, we can control our actions and how we treat our guests. As manager of the property, I want to personally apologize for any interaction that we may have had that resulted in you finding me rude and unwelcoming. Unwelcome is the absolute last thing on earth I'd want a guest to walk away from our resort feeling and for that I cannot apologize enough.

50 helpful votes,6 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst place that I have ever stayed,"I find it difficult to express, adequately, and in words, how horrible a place the Seahorse Resort is. The accommodations are poorly maintained; the towels and bedding are dirty and full of holes. The units smell awefully of mold and mildew and the managers are nasty and uninterested in the condition of the units. I felt as though I was staying in a slum unit. Additionally, they permit unlimited numbers of people in certain units, with some sleeping on terraces. This place violates an unusual number of board of health and occupancy rules.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,215,248
none,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,A Dump at the Ocean,"The Sea Horse Resort in San Clemente, CA is one of the most disgusting, disgraceful, and unhealthy accommodation at which I have every stayed.  The bathroom is full of mold and mildew.  The towels are torn and shabby. The closet in the bedroom has a stench that is truly gross.  The kitchenware is sticky.  The furniture is worn and smells.  Doors are full of holes. I would hardly call this a resort.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,216,248
