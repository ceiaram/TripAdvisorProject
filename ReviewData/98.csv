They did give us a complimentary bottle of champagne for our anniversary and my husband’s 60th bday. This was a nice treat.

After the Pelican Hill Resort, this place is the most expensive hotel in the area. Rooms are easily twice the price as those at other upscale hotels in the area.

The bad… there are a limited number of rooms facing the bay, and they are the most expensive.  The next nicer view rooms overlook the courtyard and swimming pool. A large portion of the rooms overlook the super busy and noisy Pacific Coast Hwy or the driveway entrance to the resort.

This was even during a weekend with two weddings.  Hats off to the valet staff they were consistently the highlight of the service during our stay. - Check-in, they offered us two options for a room at check-in.  One room right next to the lobby or a room furthest away from the elevator which they warned was a 5-minute walk.  With a young son who needs to nap, we opted for the less than ideal walk.

Nothing too far from home, yet close enough to feel like she has been away. I did some Googling and with the process of elimination, great reviews and photos, I selected this place. What a mistake.   When you drive up to the resort it is absolutely beautiful. The valet service is quick and professional. We walk into the main building to check-in and I speak with the person who checks us in. (I can't remember her name but her daughter's name is the same as mine but spelled with an E). Nevertheless, we begin the check-in procedure.

First off, we want to start by apologizing that your stay did not meet expectations. We can understand how frustrating it can be to checked into a room that appears damp or musty. Although we did have a room available for you to move to, we apologize about your delayed room move the following day. If customers request to move rooms at this time, we are typically not able to have the move complete until between 2pm-4pm the following day on a sold out evening. The ADA room type was offered as an alternative as it does come equipped with more space and the same view. Due to COVID 19, we do heavily stress cleanliness and fog each room before a new guest checks in. This is about a 2 hour process, which is why rooms for moves may not be ready until later in the afternoon. We only ask that you pack your luggage so that we can hold the items for you while the new room is being serviced. Furthermore, after reports of there being a pest in your room, we did contact our pest control to be sure the room was sprayed and clean after your massage. We take this very seriously as it does not occur often to be certain our property is clean and sanitary during these times. We have followed up with the front desk agent in regards to your room rate, and she did express that she had a very pleasant conversation with you about your family and your reason for travel. She did express when quoting the breakfast package that weekend prices would inflate. Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this caused during your departure. Overall, we are happy that you enjoyed your time at the spa as well as the views from your guest room. We hope that in the future you will give us another opportunity to serve you again so that we can exceed expectations during your next visit.

As admitted by their staff, they don’t have the staff to make things run normally.  This would be ok for a regular hotel, but for a premium hotel charging a premium that is not great.

At 4:15 went again to front desk and the room was ready then- this was the first apology for being understaffed.  The valet brought up the bags and just left them just inside the door- weird.

It’s unfortunate, as we spent a good amount of money just to check in at 11pm and sleep for the night in what we expected would be a nice place.   When I googled the rooms, I saw patio doors which opened to the bay. It looked peaceful and quiet. The room we got was in the furthest corner of the hotel from the bay, closest to the street. We were surprised, when we arrived, to see we were in a room with a handicapped shower. As I was checking in, the only other lady I saw in the hotel was at the front mentioning they had just checked into their room, and they wanted to know if they could get a room with a bath tub.

On top of that they charge you 40.00 a day for parking and an extra 35.00 a day for the resort fee.  For 440 a night I had an amazing view of a Taco Bell. For 100 more a night I was offered a room with a view of the marina. I’m an idiot and took it. Basically that let me look at parked boats and enjoy the noise of all the people maintaining them.   Let's talk about the resort fee. I actually called to see what all that entailed. Because all I saw was a pool about as nice as a Hampton inn. The nice young lady told me it also covers the two bottles of water in my room and the gym. I get free water when I stay at Hilton and a gym just as nice. So this resort fee is total crap.

The kids decided to warm up in the jacuzzi. My son was asked to leave the jacuzzi since they do NOT allow kids under 14 in the jacuzzi. We asked if me or my husband sat with them, would it be ok and they said the GM said ""No"" and he was watching the pool area.

Example of this is finding dirty, blood stained sheets that were left on our sofa bed from the previous guest, never something you want to encounter in a hotel stay. It is unsanitary and unsettling. We had housekeeping come up to make up the sofa bed for our kids and when they opened it there were messed up bloody sheets. It was so disgusting.

It was pretty cool to see the yachts docked up just outside the rear of the building all lit up and decked out for the holidays.  Our room was nice, modern & clean.  However after a ridiculous, pretentious resort fee and valet parking fee this night got pricey quick.  The only thing that half way made up for it was the complimentary full bottle of red wine and bottled water in our room.    I didn't get the best night sleep due to someone in the room above us that sounded like they were pacing the floor all night in high heels.

7 helpful votes,33 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A fabulous stay!!,"We had to be in California unexpectedly and flew in and out of LAX but stayed in San Diego. Traffic being what it is, (horrible), between SD and LA we decided to travel back up to LA the day before our flight so we would be closer to the airport. I started an Internet search of places to stay, we were just looking for something reasonable, nothing fancy. I checked Dana Point, Laguna, and a couple other areas but being spring break many places were booked. Our son was with us and he had a buddy in Newport Beach so we tried there and am I glad I did!!! Balboa Bay Resort is fabulous!!! Right on the water with gorgeous rooms and facilities.

Cost cutting and low level staff is obvious. What was a classy establishment has become a middle of the road hotel.
