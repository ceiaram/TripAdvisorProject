Some minor problems—air conditioning didn’t reach master bedroom. We were told it starts in the second bedroom, then cools the living area and ends in the master. The solution was to give us a huge, loud fan for the master bedroom.   Also, there are NO dressers in the master bedroom. There is a desk just like the one in the living room. This needs to be rectified.   The snacks from 5:30-7:30 pm are things like quesadillas, meatball sandwiches and burgers. There are cookies and a small salad bar. Beer, wine and soda are available.

About $400 worth of items - gone.  I have called several times and not a priority for management.  We filed a police report.

I found the facilities to be very clean and the team to be very helpful and accommodating.  I had some flowers delivered to the hotel prior to my arrival and the team was happy to set them up in our room before we arrived.  The team also upgraded our room for my wife's special day.  I have had some poor experiences in the past traveling on an employee rate.  Some hotels can treat you as ""less than"" because you are receiving an employee discount.  That was not the case at all here.  Gary and Liliana at the Front Desk were awesome.  They answered all our questions with a smile.

We arrived around Midnight to check in and had two people in front of us. Due to others arguing about the cost of parking and the front desk agent ( older lady did not get name) who seemed confused and flustered it took almost 30 minutes to check in - which would unfortunately set the pace for everything.  We always have a electric scooter delivered for mobility issues and when we asked about it she looked dumbfounded, we had to ask to  please check for the delivery of it. She claimed nothing was here so we had to call the place in the morning. When we did they confirmed the scooter WAS DELIVERED, yet no one even the manager couldn't find it!!

It started by me calling Saturday around 12:30 to see if they could check and see if a room was available early. After about 20 rings Ray the front desk clerk picks up. I ask him as an IHG rewards platinum member can you check and see if a room is available early and he says nope, 3 pm. We have a big group. I am guessing from his voice and the number of rings that he is stressed with a big group. I tell my wife that we will check one more time before going to the theme park.   I pull up about an hour later and go into the hotel to find the lobby empty and no one around. After waiting 5 minutes the clerk Ray runs over. I ask again and he says nope, 3 pm or I can give you a call. He brought up the group again.  I",May 2017,none,none,"Dear CAFL1: Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay with us.

The rooms are all suites, kitchen, full size fridge, plates, silverware, etc are provided. They have complimentary breakfast which was great. The rooms were very spacious and clean. Would recommend, very affordable and if you want to cut cost of eating out. This is the place for you. You can bring food and cook. The room does not have an oven, but has a microwave and one electric burner built in hot stove. Enough to cook meals. They have a parking garage you can park for a minimal fee per day.
