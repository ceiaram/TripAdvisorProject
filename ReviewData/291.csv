Allow me to explain, as follows:  Our guaranteed check-in time is 3 PM. As part of our Housekeeping procedures, our head housekeeper is required to check all rooms that are not rented the night before, and this starts @ 9 AM.  Our night audit process starts after 5 AM, and this is when all charges (including room & tax) are posted for the business day. As such, anyone who checks in on or before 5 AM would still be charged for room & tax for the night before; if you therefore check in, as you mentioned, between 12 midnight and 5 AM, you will still be charged for the night before.   I am not sure how the previous manager (he tendered his resignation in June 2016) or the Front Desk then handled this situation, but we no longer - for lack of a better term - do it the same way. If our current staff did not fully explain the matter, I would like to request for your understanding.",none,none,none,none,none,none,205,291

Normally, I like staying in nicer places, but in this case that would mean either sharing a room or paying a lot for two rooms.  I didn’t like either of those options.  So, I did a little research and found that I could get two rooms at this motel for the price of one room at a nicer place.  Perfect!  I was able to have my own room without paying a fortune.  Surprisingly, the rooms were actually pretty nice, and not that much different from some of the much more expensive rooms I often get.  The bed was comfortable.  The room was clean.  Internet was free.  There was even a pool, although we didn’t swim.

Our room was dirty and smelled like urine. Front desk staff on the night we checked in was a young lady that was rude and obviously hated her job. One thing I loved about this hotel was it's heated pool and hot jacuzzi. When we pulled in to the hotel I got excited as it was advertised on the sign that they had a heated pool, sauna, and jaccuzi. After we checked in I quickly hurried to my room to change into my suit. I went out to the pool area to find 'out of order' sign and the whole area locked up. I was so dissapointed.
