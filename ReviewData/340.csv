none,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,FANTASTIC location and views of the Ocean and Pier.,"Great location, great views, great staff, great town.  We got in a little early and at check in were told that they had a cancellation and we were getting upgraded to an ocean view.  The staff was great all the way around.  The complimentary margarita Wednesday was great as well.  It was just my wife and me for most of the week and my son joined us late in the stay....still plenty of room.  The area is fantastic, take some day trips!  I highly recommend the hikes on Dana Point and to Trellises beach (a very cool, local surf spot, isolated and during the week it feels like your own private beach).  Tuesday you can get 1/2 price whale watching tours out of Dana Point.  If you want to fish, you can do so off of the pier with no license required.

Right across from pier, so could watch lots of action from our balcony and easy access to restaurants.  Walking to town is easy.  Staff is exceptionally friendly and anything you ask for is immediately taken care of.  Highly recommend.  Only thing is resort fees they now charge on these exchanges make trading weeks more expensive and limits your funds to go have fun.  Other than that, it was great.  Only down side is no pool and small rooftop jacuzzi that has no view.  Tiny rooftop area is great for watching sunsets and doing a BBQ, but only about 4-6 people can fit.

We stayed Christmas through New Years and had an absolutely fabulous time.  Room #103.  Just me and my husband. Not an Oceanfront, but could see a strip of the ocean from our large balcony, which was nice. The condo was very spacious and extremely clean.  We enjoyed the gas firplace ambiance in the living room.  The kitchen was perfectly stocked with a cute dishwasher.  We enjoyed the hottub on the 3rd floor and also the sauna room. Even though we stayed during a busy week, the resort never felt overcrowded.   They had activities every day, and we enjoyed the ""get to know you breakfast"" and the ""margarita with chips and salsa night"". The staff was super friendly and nice, especially Shannon.",December 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,167,340

I was kind of bummed that we did not get true oceanfront room, but did get an oceanVIEW room which was enjoyed from our patio. This resort is much nicer than other reviews led me to expect of it.  The housekeepers came in 3 times during our stay.  We never had to call for new towels or anything at all. I was hoping for a mostly adult atmosphere, but there were children or possibly elephants staying above us who did a lot of jumping and running which we endured. We never got to use the outdoor spa because it was always full of rowdy kids when we wanted to use it.  The age requirement was not adhered to by those guests which disappointed us.

Would be close quarters for 4 people, except for maybe a family. Great location, waking up everyday to sounds and view of the ocean cannot be beat. In December it's not  crowded or loud but I would imagine in summer it's crazy. The train was not that big of a deal as the bedroom was in back of unit, but keep that in mind.

Ceiling fans and open windows for cross ventilation made the unit comfortable in spite of having no air conditioning. We obtained this unit as a timeshare exchange through RCI, and thought it was comparable to the Hawaii unit we traded for it.  There is a $9/day resort fee which covers parking and wireless internet.

Around 3am my bathroom’s ceiling pretty much caved (about 3x3 feet) in from water buildup from an overflowing tub from the room above. For the next 4 hours the ceiling continued to drip which ruined my sleep for the night. When I went downstairs in the morning I voiced the damage and complained about the disturbance to representative at the front desk when a manager stepped out from her office and said “There was no way that water was dripping for that long,” and started to argue with me with additional aggressiveness.

It is more of a San Diego feel, than Orange County. You are close to the 5 Fwy. so you can get around easily. If you surf, you're very close to Trestles, San Onofre, etc. which makes the dawn patrol especially effective. You are less than a block away from a good restaurant (White Horses is closing soon, to be replaced with an Italian place). There is the main drag for shopping, restaurants and cafes. It doesn't lack for atmosphere, but there's where you'll want to think about it. Its super touristy and very over priced.  The Pier area is very busy and our room was incredibly loud.

The kitchen in our unit has been remodelled with granite benches and contained all the cooking utensils that are required for self catering.  Dishwasher and microwave but laundry facilities were near the underground car park.  Reasonably clean and the bath linen was changed every second day of our week's stay.  Worst feature of the resort is that the railway line is a stone's throw from the front of the resort and the trains run frequently day and night.  The whistle is blasted outside the resort which meant we had to sleep with all doors and windows closed and ear plugs in our ears. The resort charges a fee for parking.

I was assured by the reservation agent that the condo had an ocean view.
