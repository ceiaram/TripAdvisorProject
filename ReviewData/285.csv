It's pretty standard for an 'all suite, extended stay' type of property.  I rarely saw other residents, but when I did they were friendly, though some were needing some laundry services.  It was quiet, no activity in the parking lot, which was very well-lit.  The grab and go breakfast was underwhelming, but I got a couple of granola bars and a coffee for free.

Overall, the housekeeping is poor. With 2 pets, I'm not the best housekeeper, but I do not like to stay in a place that's dirtier than my own home. For example, a brightly colored decorative feather laid on the hallway floor for all 3 days, and the carpet in my room felt gritty underfoot (kept my socks on). The towels were thin and rough, and the bed was uncomfortable (although clean). The air conditioning unit rattled badly when running, so I cooled the room down before going to bed so that I would not run the unit. The cable TV channel selection was surprisingly limited. On the other hand, the price is below $100 per night, the location is convenient, and the room is large.",November 2015,none,none,"I appreciate you taking the time to write a review of your experience with us.

Well, we should have done our homework.  Room was horrible, smoke detector was hanging off the ceiling, toilet was broke, plug in kitchen didn't work, and beds were so hard and noisey that we didn't get much sleep.  Next room was partying all night.  Laid awake most of the night, at 6:30am, I asked my husband if it was too early to get up and get the Hell out of here.  Checked out by 8:00am and stopped by the Residence Inn by Marriott and checked in.  Loved them and stayed until we could go back home.  Never will stay an Extended Stay again.  Very trashy.",April 2012,none,none,"Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at Extended Stay America Orange County - Lake Forest.
