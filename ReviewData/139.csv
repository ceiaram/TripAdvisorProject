We actually spoke to them first and were told the reservation could be changed, but it would be at a higher rate. The additional price was not a concern to us as it was more important to have the correct dates booked.   Upon arriving at the hotel, we were informed we were a no-show from the previous night.

The breakfast that was included with our stay was actually amazing. It had something for every one of my 4 kids and the staff stayed on top of keeping everything stocked and cleaned. The happy hour snack was fine (we are not drinkers) with snacks and drinks and additional food items at an affordable cost. The rooms were satisfactory, although the beds were not very comfortable.

Food is ok, nothing to write home about, but is a full breakfast so something for everyone. There is a shuttle to Disneyland, but costs $6 a day for adult and $3 per child (9 and younger) shuttle does not leave early enough to get to the park for magic morning. They are punctual, in fact so punctual that if you are next to the bus and the driver makes eye contact with you, he still leaves before you board. Very rude and frustrating. Has a free manager's cocktail reception. Free drinks, which is great. Snacks consist of chips and salsa, humus (don't try) and veggies.   Room was ok. Needs updating but clean. All rooms are suites.

Large 2 room suites with clean and high-end facility and equipment. The hotel was nicely architected.

As a family you like to have a little space. So embassy suites provides this.   The rooms have been updated in a half hearted way over the years. Better than a motel 6 not classy enough for a standard Hilton . Bed was clean and comfortable . Bathroom was fine as well. Refrigerator was clean and cold. Microwave and coffee maker worked as well.   The technology in the rooms is old. The Tv's are slow and limited. There is no HD happening here. The wifi is slow and 3G is faster.

Parking was $13-15/night and was easily available for an SUV getting in after midnight.  There is a shuttle to/fr Disneyland for $5/day - they give you a ticket and it is punched if you are going back and forth.    2)  The breakfast was made to order omelets with a great variety of what goes inside.

Like other Embassy Suites a nice breakfast and cocktail hour are included which adds value. What supprised me when we arrived was the fact that they charge $12 per day for parking. On top of that they do offer a shuttle service to Disney Land but that is another $5 per person. This definitly took away from the overall value of this hotel. When we stay again I will be looking for a hotel with a free shuttle service and free parking. On top of the $12 per day parking, my rental car was damaged in the parking lot (which I understand is not the hotels fault).

We had plenty of room to spread out since we got the slightly larger suite in the front of the hotel. If your a light sleeper, you should request a higher floor suite.

I love Embassy Suites because they have the separate sleeping room from the living room which is great when traveling with kids.  This is a great place to stay with a big group.

First off, I am deeply sorry for the horrible experience and the negative impact it has left on you and your family, especially your two year old.  Guest reviews and feedback are extremely important to us whether good or bad because it allows us to learn and grow at the same time as well as communicate and improve moving forward.  Overall, guest experience is truly a top priority among our staff and team and we recognize that 95% of our guests are visiting us on vacation with children of all ages.  Our resident Lion, Leo, was added to our Embassy Suites family to enhance the experience of all our guests in a positive and fun way… not to terrify or scare the children in any way.  Over the years, Leo, has become loved by so many and has truly become a staple of our atrium area.  Please know that whenever we get any types of complaints or feedback from our guests whether about the condition of their room, location or their experience we always do our absolute best to make the bad experiences right for our guests and their families.  With regards to the hair you found in the bathtub, I’m hoping you allowed us the opportunity to make an attempt to make this situation right by expressing your concerns of the cleanliness with the hotel or with an Housekeeping Associate while you were here.  Because we are such a family friendly hotel, often times our guests (whether adults or children) enjoy spending a lot of time at our outdoor swimming pool… it is because of this that often times, there may be areas of the hotel that experience getting wet or damp from guests walking through public areas after exiting the pool.  Unfortunately, there are times when they may not have not been completely dried off but I can assure you had we known that the couch was wet, we would have immediately done our best to notify guests and made all attempts to dry and isolate the area.  Safety is high priority and often times the Lobby area where the couch is located does see traffic from guests attempting to get to the pool or leaving the pool area to get back to their suites.  Please know that I have shared your review with our entire staff and we have definitely learned from this experience and your comments and are diligently working on ways of improving our communication and service with our guests. Again, we apologize and we would like to thank you for taking the time to post your review.",none,none,none,none,none,none,2277,139

We were told we could see fireworks from Disneyland from that vantage point. That was a nice consideration, even though we knew we wouldn’t be in the room on any of the days at fireworks time.
