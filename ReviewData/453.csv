This is a tiny hotel located at not so great location. The room was cheap and they put us in an ""accessible room"" which we did not ask for. But it meant the bathroom had a hand shower with a folding chair attached to wall instead of a bath tub. But worst part was that the bathroom floor had slope *away* from the drain hole and as a result you would be standing in a 2 inch deep water while taking a shower. The hotel management was not helpful at all. The breakfast room was tiny and the offerings were less than normal comfort inn standard.

They called the front desk if they could get some toiletries. The front desk replied in a rude tone of voice, ""come down and get them."" - One of the room reservations was mixed up and we lost the great rate when the room rate doubled.
