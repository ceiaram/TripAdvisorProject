The beds and pillows are so fluffy making for a cozy sleeping experience. The shower head is phenomenal! It has a fast pulsating speed level that is out of this world. With us going to Disneyland 3 days in a row, and walking all day long, my muscles thanked me for using that message like speed level. Check in was effortless, and all the we interacted with were friendly. We had a range of ages from 65 to 7, and not a one complaint from anyone.

The smell was not bad, but it was there, kind of like an old hotel room that once upon a time ago allowed smoking in the rooms.

Anything i needed they would go above and beyond to assist me. I think they would serve the company better at a 5 STAR property because thats how they treat people. If I was the owner of this hotel I would sleep very easy knowing I have these 2 employees  representing my hotel. Not only me I see how they are with the other guest and they make everyone feel like they are a VIP Guest. I have been staying here for a couple weeks on and off.

It was obviously a busy day and he used it for at least an hour.   Couldn't the hotel afford something else to transport supplies around the property?

I think during ""wedding season"" in southern California perhaps the hotel should have someone stationed outside to monitor this situation.  On another note, the sink in our room did not drain well.

I want to start off by thanking you for choosing to stay with us during your recent travels to the Costa Mesa/Newport Beach area. We appreciate your business and hope that we’ll be able to welcome you back the next time you find yourself out here by the beautiful beaches and the fun attractions Orange County has to offer.  I also want to thank you for taking the time to provide us with your candor and your feedback. It’s important to us knowing when we got it right, and where we can work to improve our overall guests’ experiences. We pride ourselves in doing our best to ensure each and every guest has a comfortable and satisfactory stay leaving them looking forward to their next visit. Using your personal experience allows us to know what works and what changes and steps we can take to better our customer service.  Upon review of your comments, I was left disheartened to learn that you left without being fully satisfied with your stay. Let me start off by ensuring you that we have zero smoking rooms on this property. We enforce our non-smoking policies to the fullest of our ability and take every precaution we can to encourage our smoking guests to use the designated smoking areas on property that are away from the guest rooms. That being said, it's an unfortunate truth that we are not able to control the behaviors of certain guests and ask all our guests to reach out to us during their stay if they encounter any unpleasantness that we might be able to assist with. Our staff takes a great deal of pride in responding to guest complaints in an efficient matter to ensure satisfaction all around.   In regards to the additional incidental amount you noted on your bank statement, please note that, like most hotels that accept credit and debit cards, we authorize our guests' payment cards for the full amount of their stay and an additional amount in case of any incidental charges, i.e. room service, movies, phone calls, etc. Upon check-out, this additional amount, if not accrued against real charges, is released back to our guests' accounts. While this release typically takes 24-48 hours to reflect, some banks operate a little differently and may have their own policies and procedures when it comes to credit authorizations. We are always happy to be at your disposal should you or your bank require any notification from our behalf to assist with an expedited release of funds.  Turning towards your comments regarding our hotel's restaurant, please note that the Sunset Grille & Lounge is open daily for breakfast and dinner only - we have always remained closed for lunch. On the Thanksgiving holiday, we did open for breakfast, but remained closed for dinner to allow more of our team members to be able to celebrate the holiday with their families. We provided a special holiday meal to the few staff that stayed on duty for our guests. I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience caused by the restaurant's closure, and will ensure all our staff in future offer great recommendations for local eateries for lunch to any inquiring guests.  Once again, we thank you for your business and feedback and hope that I’ve been able to answer any questions and concerns you’ve shared. I welcome you to reach out to me directly so that I can be sure to provide any further assistance you might require. I look forward to hearing back from you, and we all hope to get the chance to welcome you back to the Ramada Inn & Suites in Costa Mesa/Newport Beach.

This hotel was on the list of hotels we could choose from for Surf City Softball tournaments. Part of the reason our team chose this hotel was the price and the free breakfast.

You can not apply the $3.99 as a credit towards other food. If you are promised free breakfast when you make your reservation, then that should be grandfathered in.

Since my room door opened directly to a narrow walkway which was outside the hotel, I heard a lot of noise from the parking lot and had to deal with smokers just feet from my non-smoking room.  The desk staff mostly acted like they were indifferent to my needs as a hotel guest; more interest was paid to running my credit card and noting license information than to providing recommendations or directions after I asked for them.  As people entered their lobby, the desk staff rarely acknowledged or welcomed anyone.

I am proud to say that we contract experts for preventive pest control on a weekly basis, for the property exterior and guestroom interiors. In the rare times we are informed that there is a pest problem, our standard procedure is to summon these experts to verify the presence of pests, and take the necessary measures to remove them immediately. In the case of this reviewer, these experts were unable to find any signs of pest activity. Despite this, I am glad that Alvetta was able to comfort the reviewer in the manner requested of us.  Our management team conducts regular walk-throughs of the property to proactively resolve issues such as noise and public consumption of alcohol. In the case where a guest alerts us to a problem occurring between these walk-throughs, our management team responds immediately to resolve the situation. While we cannot directly control the behavior of other guests, we do have the option to have such guests vacate the area.

We encourage all of our guests to let us know about their stay so we can resolve any matters on-site.

We did get our suite, but the air conditioning is in the living room and doesn't seem to quite make it into the back bedroom.  We froze out our kids on the pullout sofa bed :) oops! An extra blanket took care of that.  The kids loved the pool and the assortment of food at the breakfast bar.  Good location for walking to restaurants such as Outback Steakhouse.  Very short drive to the beach.  We would probably book",July 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1312,192
6 helpful votes,7 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Costa Mesa Find,"This is an excellent value for your travel dollar.  My wife and I spent 4 nights here in June 2005.  We read many reviews of hotels in the Costa Mesa/ Newport area and decided we would try staying here. A very pleasent surprise.    Its very easy to find (when you turn off the 405 onto the 55 to Newport, you drive past it) and is in a safe and useful area.  Many restaurants close grocery shops close.  Its not on or near the beach and you will need a car, however, it is an easy 5 min drive to the beach areas.  Newport/ costa mesa is a very clean and safe area.  We never felt uneasy about the area of the Ramada.  But you do need a car to get to your destinations (beach, shops etc).  As far as the hotel is concerned, it is very new and very clean.  The rooms were very clean and",June 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1313,192

We were staying here as part of a murder mystery package with Mystery Cafe. When we arrived we noticed (and heard) construction going on EVERYWHERE. We were put in a room right above a jackhammer. When I called the front desk I was told that it would cease at 6 and would not start in the morning until 9. Both of those times were wrong. Our room shook so bad. We could not hear the TV at all. Everything was constantly changing. They had a makeshift front desk that was located on one side when we went up to our room & gone when we came down. Finding everything in this hotel was like a scavenger hunt, with how frequently they were miving locations. Also, you never knew which elevator they were going to have open.

7 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clean, comfortable, cheap!","At first glance, from the street the hotel doesn't look too appealing.  However, once you turn into the parking lot it doesn't look that bad.  It basically looks like several apartment buildings.  We only stayed here for one night so the price was reasonable at $79 per room.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, we were able to get both of our rooms on the same floor and it was even better because we had the ground floor and transferring luggage back and forth was not a problem.  There is a television on an armoir( is that how you spell it?), small refrigerator, iron and ironing board, a safety box, small coffee maker, and blowdryer.  The location of the hotel is perfect because it is near many places such as Balboa peninsula, Fashion Island Mall, movie theatres, Starbucks,",April 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1315,192

Nothing special - but the rooms are clean and comfortable, the pool area is quite nice, and the free breakfast is adequate. There are conveniences within easy walking distance (grocery store, Starbucks, shopping), and the beach is a short drive away. I would not use this as a home base for a trip to Disneyland (it's a pretty long drive), but if you are interested in being close to the beaches and immersing yourself in the Southern California culture, this is a good place to stay.",August 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1318,192
18 helpful votes,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Fantastic hotel and staff!!!,"This was truly one of the best hotels I have stayed at for this price (79.00).  Check in was quick and painless and the staff was great.  They helped us with finding a great place to eat, very knowlegable about the area and earger to help.  The entire property was well kept and very clean.  The room was very clean no smells, stains, or problems at all.  Everything worked and did not look worn out or abused.  The property is within a short drive to Newport Beach and its pier and Hwy one with tons of great shops and places to eat.  The property has its back to Newport Blvd. but I never could tell a busy street was there.  We had two rooms for one night and would stay there again.
