What stands out for me in a property is the service personnel, and the cleanliness . The Volare  excelled in both.  As mother of the groom I booked rooms for the groomsmen, family and friends. Savannah worked with me on the bookings and I changed my mind more than once.  I do not live in the area so I needed a lot of help.  She is a gem, she was professional, friendly and efficient with excellent attention to detail.  I had the pleasure of meeting her the day of check in and she treated me and all the guests with such courtesy, she was polite and she was so helpful!   The rooms were sparkling clean, and the service at this property was second to none.  We reserved a poolside meeting",February 2023,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,186
