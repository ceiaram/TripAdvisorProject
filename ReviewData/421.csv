I stayed in 38A, which can accommodate 3 people. One single twin bed, with the other 2 beds as bunk beds. There were 2 small side tables and one dresser. There was a ceiling fan and two small lamps.

There are 2 entrances to room 38A, one door from within the cottage, and the other entrance on the side of the cottage where one can easily access the deck.  Cottage 38 had beautiful views from the kitchen and on each side deck.
