And of course the plug in the bathroom still didn't work. The place is a fire hazard. I told my company about it and they for sure will never, ever have anybody stay there in the future.",May 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,609,225
3 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great but no WI-FI,We stayed at the Heritage Inn for seven days. We had a King Suite and the rest of the family had a double queen. The hotel was very clean and had new carpet. The staff was very polite and helpful. It was next to a nice Steak House with great food and a 15% discount for hotel customers. Target and a grocery were close too. The King Suite was awesome! We had a huge living area and a dining table for six people along with a kitchenette. The bedroom was large too and the bathroom had a garden tub whirlpool. We were able to feel comfortable and relax at the end of the day. For someone who is used to a large house this was a comfortable place to stay.,August 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,610,225

We had been very disappointed over the past few years in several hotels/motels in the Anaheim area and decided to try the Heritage this year. The room was nice and comfortable, and exceptionally clean as well. The staff was friendly and courteous.  A continental breakfast was offered, but we didn't try it since we had other breakfast plans. There is a laundry room with two washers and dryers. Our only caution to others going there: the newspaper vending machines don't work reliably. The hotel itself was great.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,611,225

If you are in the Fullerton/Anaheim area, the Heritage Inn is the place where one should reside overnight.  Never have I felt so relaxed and comfortable in a hotel far from home.  The service and the people are top notch.  Overall, my experience at the Inn was unforgettable and non-regrettable.  Thanks Heritage Inn. . .",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,612,225
