The big improvement is the bed, as the 4"" foam mattress is replaced with a normal height model, similar to the ones being deployed in the mainline Marriott properties (but not, alas, up to the Renaissance standards). A new comforter is in place; alas, it is still cheap nylon, but is has a bit more stuffing. Down pillows are also standard.  The restaurant was closed during my stay - I do not know when it will re-open. The rennovations should be complete in the spring of 2004.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,236,362
