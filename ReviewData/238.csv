The room smelled bad and the fridge smelled like rotten food.  The lay out of the room is completely different than the pictures on this website.  Not to mention I completely question the fact that some of the picutres on this site are listed as traveler photos when they look identical to the photos provided by the hotel with ultra bright lights and new linens.  I paid $146 for one night in this dump and left within thirty minutes because I was so disgusted.  The furniture was old, chipped and worn out.  The couch had stains on it.

35 helpful votes,12 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Not user friendly,I booked this room in advance from Texas. I was scheduled to attend a concert at The Coach Housein San Juan Capistrano and was led to believe this was very near as well as the closest to the venue. Not true. It was on the northern edge of San Juan more like Mission Viejo. When I arrived and saw the location I explained my situation and that it was farther than I was expecting and asked if I could bail out they were very rude and non understanding. Explained their 72 hour cancellation policy and said tough luck. I got stuck with a full price charge. Bad customer service. No compromise. The outside was filthy and unkept I can only imagine the inside. Oh well.,March 2013,none,none,"Thank you for your review.  However, it is incorrect in the fact that our cancellation policy is 48 hours and not 72 that you had mentioned.  Also, we do not state that we are the closest hotel to the Coach House, even though we are just a few miles north of the Coach House.  As for our exterior and the rooms, most guests think it is actually in great shape.  Most of our rooms are Suites with a separate sitting area, some with relaxing Jacuzzis, and all rooms now have either one or two 37"" Flat Screen TVs.    Please do come and visit us again and this time take a look at our rooms and rates, and you will be pleasantly surprised at how economical it is compared to the other hotels in the area.",none,none,none,none,none,none,42,238

When I notified the clerk of my satisfaction, she asked me if I wouldn't mind going on trip advisor and yelp and reviewing the property.  I was happy to oblige.  The staff was very nice, the rooms were spacious, clean, and well-maintained. They did not have a flatscreen TV or duvet bedding, but I didn't mind since I just needed a clean and safe place to sleep overnight.  Also was watching my budget, so you can't beat it for 80 bucks.

It is about 1 foot from the freeway and has train tracks on the other side.  The room was disgusting -- D-I-R-T-Y!!  The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in several days (or longer).

However, your response is a little outdated since it is based on a stay a few years ago.  We have since renovated the property with new carpeting, bath tubs, vanities, paint, doors, etc.  Our proximity to the freeway is what most of our guests seek.  We have double payne windows in our guest rooms for an added level of sound proofing.  Furthermore, we now have suites, jacuzzi rooms, family rooms, with free internet access, microwave and fridge, and parking.  We encourage you to stay once again at our property and see the difference.  Majority of our guests are very pleased with our services, amenities, price, and overall value.

105 helpful votes,449 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Well worth the price!,"So, I was able to stay at the Americas Best Value Inn in Laguna Niguel over night. For the price of most standard rooms, I was able to get a room with a king size bed AND a jacuzzi. It was awesome! It takes a little while for the water to fill the tub, but sooo well worth the wait. The room itself is simple and clean, but the jacuzzi... felt like luxury. They offer a free continental breakfast (danish and coffee) which a sweet touch, but it didn't seem worth the trouble. I had a room on the second floor and every once in a while I would hear the metro go by, but it didn't bother me all that much. If you are really sensitive to traffic noise, you may want to get a room more toward the back. I really did enjoy my stay here.",February 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,47,238

We had a comfortable king size bed and they give you two pillows each, unlike most motels where you only get one. Our room was cleaned and maintained. Everything worked. Great little microwave and refrigerator with a little freezer that even kept our ice cream frozen. Roomy bathtub/shower combo with great water pressure and nice hot water. HBO was offered, a lot of channels to choose from. My friend brought her laptop and they had internet access. A new vanity had been put into our bathroom recently.

The flooring must be be so thin without any soundproofing. I would never stay at this chain or  lodge again.

57 helpful votes,35 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't Even Think About It,"Worst hotel ever.  Window coverings (yes, paper coverings) were filthy.  I-5 was 50 yards on one side, and the metrolink train was 50 yards on the other. Spiderwebs around the crown moulding and sprinkler heads.  Plumbing is backward (that is why at first there was not hot water in the shower). Photos of property and room deceptive on size; king suite was quite small but looked huge in photos. Initial rate was $99 for 3 nights. When checking out, they charged me $150 for the one night I did say. Total rip off.  Much better hotels in the area for the same price.

8 helpful votes,11 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Would rather stay home...,First room we checked into had a broken lock. And we were expected to stay there. Second room we got had a plumbing problem. Towels were stained. Stains and marks on the walls. Freeway noise on one side and train noise on the other side of the property. At $100+ per night this was a huge disappointment. A dirty blanket was issued to us...stained with 'chocolate' or something else. (YUCK!) Pillows were encased in plastic & stained - thankfully we brought our own - nothing like listening to crinkling plastic all night. What a nightmare... Travelers beware.
