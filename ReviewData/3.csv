It is extremely clean and bright, and the grounds are always well taken care of. We have stayed in Buildings 1 and 2, and these are Newly remodeled and very spacious. I highly suggest to stay in the Pirates Suite Atleast one time!  I’m not the kind of person who says “who care about the room, I’ll be in Disneyland the majority of the time”.

Our team is dedicated to providing each guest with a 5-star service, sorry we were unsuccessful. We do not allow smoking in the room or on balconies to keep the room clean and odor free. Although we don’t allow smoking in all rooms, we do have a designated smoking area on our property. We do apologize that our Front Desk staff failed to show you where our smoking area is on our property map. We have brought your comments to the attention of our Executive Housekeeper to ensure the smell in your room is taken care of right away.

Our Front Desk Staff is happy to fix any issues to your satisfaction or find an alternative room option for you (if we have one available). I am also sorry that the walk to Disney was far for you. There is a shuttle that can take you to Disneyland called the Anaheim Resort Transit bus (ART bus). I apologize that our Front Desk Staff did not inform you of this option. Thank you for letting our Front Desk Staff know about your missing $20. I spoke to our staff and apologize for the misunderstanding in which only $10 was returned to you. I’m thrilled to hear that our Front Desk Manager was able to refund you the money before the investigation was completed, and you approved of the amount. We do have rollaway beds available for our guests for a nightly fee of $15 a night plus tax, which comes to a grand total of $52.95 including taxes for a three-night stay. We do apologize for the confusion about the nightly fee for our rollaway beds. We take pride in knowing that we were one of the last hotels in the surrounding areas to charge for parking at a low fee of $20 + tax a day. Which is a steal, compared to surrounding areas who offer up to $35 dollars for parking. Our walking distance is typically an 8-10 minute walk, but if you are walking with little ones, their tiny adorable legs might add a few minutes to that. I’m happy to see that you were able to get your pizza delivery at midnight. For security purposes, all access to our buildings are locked at all times and requires a valid key card to enter. Due to this security measure, all food deliveries will be dropped off and picked up at the Front Desk to avoid any confusion for the delivery drivers and to ensure the safety of our guests.

It was our first time in the area so I tried to do as much research as I could to find the best hotel. I am very happy with my choice!   I was able to get a very good price by booking early (3-4 months ahead) on the Wyndham site; cancellable.  That's one great thing I noticed about Wyndham hotels, is that their prices fluctuate and you can keep your eyes out for a great deal.    When we checked in they had blow up balloon swords and pirate hats for the kids.

Unfortunately, as with most hotels in the area they are responding to a waning COVID pandemic with over reaction and inconsistent policies.

Neighboring unit smoking weed.  Walls/ventilation so poor that your family can enjoy.  Not remodeled - tile job from the 70s. Skylight on both sides of the room?

Constant rumble (not freeway) occurs every 10 seconds.  The floor was more cimfortable to sleep on and provided a little more darkness to the room.  Rename building to Tower of Terror.

In regards to the fees, we do charge a total of $20 for a incidental fee that is then returned upon check out as long as nothing is missing or damaged in the room, we do have one of the least amount of incidental fees in Anaheim with other hotels charging over $100 per night. We also have a parking charge, this is paid separately so that guests who do not bring a car do not need to pay for parking. We also do this to make sure we limit the number of cars so we can make sure that all of our guests have a parking spot available at check in.

That’s why we went with the Hojo. Just a hop skip and jump from Disneyland. We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms, and -we’re thrilled with the vintage vibe, colorful decor, and absolutely iconic photo ops.

We also are excited to announce that we saw your review and have added a BIG sign telling guests to approach the gate for entry with instructions so that should help with the confusion of where the entrance is. We have spoken with the front desk staff to make sure to explain to guests in buildings 3 - 6 that there are no elevators and if they have a wheelchair, stroller or limited mobility we are put them in a room that works best for them on the first floor. Now that we are fully staffed at the front desk we do have staff that can help carry luggage up the stairs as well. When we do the renovation in those buildings our number on priority is to add a elevator. The top floor rooms are definitely a preference, we have some guests who love them because it lets so much natural light in the room feels huge, but you can indeed request for a first floor if you might have little ones who need a nap during the day.

The walk to the Disney park gates is less than 10 minutes, with a few places to grab breakfast on the way by.  Why 3 stars??? This hotel is set up to accommodate young families or maximum 4 in a room. We booked through our airline as part of a package including both hotel and airfare. When the booking was made we were reassured that 5 people could fit into the rooms and each person would fit. At check in we were assigned a room with 2 queen sized beds and informed that rollaway beds were an extra charge. With 2 adults and 3 adolescents in a room there was no way we would fit in 2 queen beds.

We decided to choose this hotel for our toddler since she likes small slides and it was perfect for her. The first problem started when they told us, you have to make reservations for the water park and parking costs. Which while booking through the Wyndham app, both of those details were left out. As you can imagine planning a reservation around a toddlers nap and food times was challenging especially due to their rule of you have to check in to your pool reservation 30 minutes before your time or they cancel and give away your reservation. So you get to the gate and then wait 30 minutes which was pretty inefficient in our option.

We are sorry to hear you did not have a 5 star experience during your stay with us. We understand it can be difficult to make plans with toddler and we are more than happy notify our pool attendants if you will be arriving late so that they will keep your reservation until you arrive, or move your reservation to a time that works better for you. We have added the pool reservation system to give everyone the opportunity to use our aquatic facilities, especially in the summer time when the pool areas normally get very crowded. In order to achieve this, we are allowing our guests to make two 2-hour reservations per day of their stay. These reservation times are spaced by 30 minute cleaning intervals so our pool attendants can sanitize the areas. We will be working with Wyndham to have the app updated to reflect our new procedures. We also apologize that one of the slides was closed during your stay. Our pool attendant noticed that there was a small crack in the slide and for the safety of our guests, we had to close it down to prevent any injuries.

none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,It was overpriced for what we were able to do.,The main reason we decided to stay in this hotel is because of the water playgrounds for our kids. I called two weeks in advance because I did see that we needed to schedule a two hour window per day for the water park due to new covid restrictions . When I called the lady told me I didn’t have to reserve a time and was able to use the park as we wished. Once we arrived my kids were not able to use the water amenities as we wished (as stated by the receptionist) and everything was completely booked for the two hour windows. At one point my kids had to use the water park from 8- 10pm…. Too late for small kids to be using a water park. Not worth it!!

That is the reason why we provide a Water Safety Rules document to each guest as they enter our aquatics facilities to prevent such incidents in the first place.  It states that our pool attendants are not lifeguards (although they are certified in CPR and First Aid), and that parents are responsible for directly supervising their own children.  I have reviewed the video from that evening that shows that you did move your chair to the edge of the pool to be near your non-swimmer child.  The video shows our attendant had opened the pool gate for your husband to exit and to allow in a hotel employee in with a cart of pool towels.  Your child had stepped off of the shallow end steps and had bobbed in the water for just under two seconds when you became aware and jumped in and then walked with him by your side out of the pool.  The Red Cross recommends that parents should be within arms reach and not distracted by such things as cell phones.  It is also recommended to be in the pool with a non-swimmer youngster.  While we don’t provide swim vests, many parents do bring their own, and we sell inflatable vests and floaties in our Main St. Market gift shop.  I’m glad your child was not injured in this incident, and I hope you otherwise had a delightful stay at Howard Johnson Anaheim.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1083,3

We've been fans of another hotel near Disney, but decided to go with the Howard Johnson this time. Favorite parts: - the staff was wonderful.

When we needed new towels, and to have our trash taken out, someone arrived within minutes. Every interaction was great. Paula at the front was friendly at check in. - the room (Building 2) was large, nice, and well appointed. It felt more spacious than the Disney properties, for sure.

I love that our room had an empty mini fridge so we could put stuff in it. There was a store in the lobby of our building that had everything we could need. We were able to get yogurt and water and fruits etc. The best thing was that we were facing the highway but They put in double windows so we didn't hear anything. We had a window and you had to go through the closet to go out and the balcony where there was another sliding glass door that led you outside. It's a great design. It was 10-minute walk to the parks. The shower head shampoo conditioner and shower gel pumps in them which was awesome.

The main reason why I booked this hotel was the water playground. The kids had fun at the water playground and the staff at the playground were super nice. My positive experience basically ends here.

We were in the main building to the right of the front office. We were placed in a room that was set back from the hall and therefore much smaller. We only had two adults and a toddler, yet we were constantly tripping over each other. Very, very small room. The bathroom had hardly any counter space. The balcony access was through the closet, which was incredibly strange. The bed was fairly uncomfortable- very firm and my husband and I woke up with aching backs.

All of our rooms, that face the City View of our property, have balcony access through the closet because we double pane the sliding glass doors to block out excess freeway noise. In order to do so, the only way to make the freeway noise almost impossible to hear, was by extending the balcony enough so that all of our guests still have balcony space and by extending we then had to place the door inside of the closet.

I was traveling alone with my kids and the woman at the desk kindly offered them balloon swords to entertain them while I checked in. She was super patient and playful with them. My kids received other treats throughout our stay like gold coins and a take home rubber ducky. Small things that just really made them feel special. Esmeralda was one of the lifeguards on the bigger waterslide. She memorized all of the kids names (not just my kids) and they all loved her.

I was concerned when we first got out of the car about the noise from the highway but as soon as we walked into the building we couldn't hear it any more.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Perfect for Disney...,We loved staying at this HoJos but it needs to be noted that side by side double strollers will not fit through room doorways and so you will either need to book an ADA room or have to empty and fold your stroller every time you enter or leave. It was a huge pain to do so and it added time and frustration to our stay. We were offered an ADA room with bunk beds (all that was available) but that didn’t work since I have twin toddlers and the bunk beds would have posed as a safety risk.   All in all it was a great stay except for that one frustration.

For compliance, all ADA rooms do have larger entrances in order to accommodate handicap accessibility. When we did renovations on building 1, we created an additional 7 ADA rooms which required extensive building renovations to widen the doorways. Renovations to widen the entry doors for all 296 rooms on property is something that we do not have the ability to do. We sincerely apologize that this was not brought to your attention in advance.

We sincerely apologize for the service that you have received. I know we have recently spoke about this situation to make sure that this never happens again. You did book through a third party which states the room type and which building you booked in, booking directly through the hotel will have more pictures and details about the room type that you book. We always want to remind our guests, that if they want to guarantee a bunk bed room or a room in building 1(the building that has been recently renovated) they would need to book that specific room type. I see we did give you a free upgrade to the renovated building which put you overlooking Disneyland on the top floor with two queen beds, from the two double beds that you had originally booked. Our bunk bed rooms do book up very far in advance, but I see that the front desk did offer to move you to the bunk bed room when it opened the following day again at no additional upgrade fee. We are not an animal friendly property but we do indeed accept service animals, when there is a service animal staying with us we actually do not allow that room to be occupied for multiple days after to make sure that the carpets are deep cleaned, shampooed and vacuumed so that there is little to no remnants of any animals. We also make sure to vacuum the room in between every single guest who checks out. Again, we sincerely apologize for the service that you have received, and after speaking with the front desk manager this is something that will never happen again.

We apologize over any miscommunication regarding the New Years Eve fireworks and the firework views from our property. We do have some rooms where the fireworks can be seen from the balcony. The fireworks are also viewable from our water playground area. Due to high winds, Disney had to cancel the 9pm showing of the New Years Eve fireworks for fire safety. This is something that Disney does not inform neighboring hotels of as they try to wait to see if the weather gets better to allow the fireworks to be performed. They make the official cancellation announcement within the park just before the fireworks are scheduled to go off. They did perform a limited showing of the midnight fireworks but had to cut those short as the winds began to pick back up.

I’ve noticed that the hojo has started to pay more attention to its guests who have an influence on social media rather than their normal guests. If you follow the hojo on social media, you can see that they put a lot of effort into making their social media influencers rooms perfect with extra perks, very clean and they give them priority of the refurbished rooms rather than the regular rooms.

When we entered our building (which has interior corridors), we were greeted by the smells of a poopy diaper/nursing home/cleaning products odor that was there for the whole 4 nights we stayed.  That's just the way it smells.  Fortunately, the room did not smell that bad.    Secondly, they do not have elevators, which I knew.

All of our interactions with the staff was nothing short of excellent. The kids loved the pool and the water park area -so much so that they wanted to come back from Disney - which is mildly irritating after paying out so much for Disney :-) Less than 10 min walk to the parks - and a great option (and a lot cheaper) than staying at a Disney Hotel and just as convenient.
