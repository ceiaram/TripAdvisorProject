72 helpful votes,91 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice place to stay,"This was a nice motel. I was just looking for a place to sleep and shower while visiting Disneyland. I wanted something a little away from Disneyland so it would be less expensive. This was perfect. I did not make  a detailed inspection for cleanliness--just a general check for clean beds, linens, towels and bathroom. I would have like to have a refrigerator, but I knew they didn't have them. Beds were very comfortable. When I found out we had a room overlooking the pool, I thought it would be very noisy---NO it wasn't. By about 10pm until 9am, or so, it was very quiet. This is close to many places to eat, gas stations, freeways, about 15 minutes from Disneyland.  Very friendly staff. We loved it. I would definitely stay here again.",July 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,78,177

The manager Daniel or David, I believe, Has NO idea how to run a business. The service was terrible and the rooms are dirty. There are burn marks in the sheets and on the floor. If you want extra pillows or blankets, You have to walk to the front desk yourself. The manager should honestly be replaced because he is beyond rude and was very childish when confronted about poor service. The one in Stanton is much cleaner and was $15 cheaper for the same day and was way more convieniently located by more restaurant choices.

My greatest complaint with many lower-priced motels is that non-smoking rooms aren't really non-smoking, having heavily shampooed carpeting but the lingering smoke-damage from guests who ignore their policies is hard to ignore. This Motel 6 did not have that problem. It's also fully handicap-equipped, elevator and checkin is invariably quick and efficient.

There was no way I could sleep like that.  Ugh.  When we checked out the night shift manager admitted to knowing of the roach infestation, especially on the 1st floor, which is where I was.
