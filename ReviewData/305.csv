The room was dirty with hair found in the bathroom.  We stayed for several days and our room was never cleaned.  When I called the front desk to ask why, I was told someone told me cleaning is done only by request, this was news to me.  The front desk had pretty poor service and almost argued with me over the cleaning issue.  The breakfast area smelled of raw sewage and was dirty.  I asked for the manager and was told I will have to wait until tomorrow.  I emailed the address for the manager from the business card handed out in the lobby and it bounced back.

The pool is not heated, to the sad dismay of my excited children. We ended up in an outdated room, where you can tell it has been cleaned, but still very worn and dirty.

I discovered you can take the Toy Story bus to the lot but you still have to walk across the lot. It saved a bit of walking but added another 5 min overall.

Good location.,We chose the hotel because òf the family suite layout - we have 2 teenage boys so the typical layout of 2 double beds in USA is not suitable for us.  The location is great - not quite close enough to walk to Disney but we sinply ordered uber each day. Rooms a little dated - clean but the carpet felt a little damp. Maybe it had been washed. Beds ok - not luxurious but not uncomfortable. Main problem is walls quite thin and you can hear people walking about in other rooms. Very good breakfast included - large selection of food with plenty of tables. Plenty of parking but approx $15 per night.

So you can walk to the parking lot and take the free tram to the park.   The motel is old and quite dated. However, the beds were not uncomfortable, the AC in the room works, and so does the hot tub (we snuck in after ""closing time"" to ease our aching legs and backs after a full day in the park).   The staff was INCREDIBLY friendly and helpful. We drove an electric vehicle and they moved their own cars to allow me to park next to an outlet so that I could charge during our stay.

Although we didn’t have a renovated room it was nice to have heaps of space for us and our 2 teens who had their own space in a 2nd bedroom, which was equipped with bunk beds, their own bathroom and TV. Staff were always friendly and helpful and were always aiming to please. Only down sides of this hotel are that it can be a bit noisy with people bringing suitcases past your room (it’s tiled so it’s a bit noisy) as well as when guests run past your room (especially in the morning when excited children are preparing for a day at Disneyland !) also breakfast was hectic, it’s quite a small space and we found it tough to find a seat some days,as well as finding it difficult to move around other patrons.

Our room had been refurbished recently apparently, but for the life of me I couldn't see where! Old fashioned wallpaper, furniture and fittings and the nasty colour of the paint -just wow!!!!

It’s about a 25min walk to the Disney entrance so maybe with little kids it may not be ideal, we didn’t visit Disney so it wasn’t an issue for us. Pool wasn’t working for half of our stay but we just did more shopping. The noise is an issue if your on the bottom floor you can hear upstairs walking, they definitely need to sound proof a bit better. Other then that issue and a few door issues we had over numerous days ( which they fixed immediately) we had a great stay! Would definitely recommend.

They charge for parking, but do not have enough spots for all of their guests to park. They have a Valet and if you come in late you leave your car with him. People seem to park in areas where there are no parking spots, the hotel/valet does nothing & one has to maneuver around them.   2.

The two bedroom suites for families are large and comfortable. It may be cramped though if you have more than 2 children and use the sofa bed to sleep 4 children.

The staff are polite and will do what they can to make your stay a better one. Parking is limited especially during the busy times of the year like our stay over Easter.

The suite was perfectly suited to our situation as we had 2 queen beds in one room and 1 sofa bed and 1 bunk bed in the other room for the kids.  Each room had a 2 sink bathroom with toilet and shower/bath.  Very convenient and no line ups for the bathroom. The room had a microwave and fridge as well.  We had an issue with creaking noises when the room above us was occupied and people were walking around.  Recommend to grab a 3rd floor room (which we moved to after two nights) and no more creaking noise!  The pool was a usual size for a Best Western, ok for a group of people to be in.

6 helpful votes,28 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent for a basic.,"Considering its stars and usual clientele (im guessing) being overnighters or long weekend-ers, this was a perfectly adequate hotel for our 9 night stay. The rooms were spacious and clean (SO important!) and the beds were ridiculously comfortable! I wanted to take my mattress home! The room was tidied and beds made each day unless we requested otherwise. The breakfast whilst fairly basic, does have quirky elements such as make your own waffles straight from the batter, and whilst most on offer is not overly healthy there is fruit and yoghurt too. We also managed to have actual ENGLISH tea!! Very important for fellow Brits to know, as this was hard to come by ANYWHERE in Disneyland or LA.....

I liked that the vanity was desperate from the restroom. So people can shower and others can brush their teeth. The hot breakfast was great.

I called the front desk and luckily they had the 2 br/2 ba suite I had wanted but charged me an additional 60.00 plus tax.

So don't bother of that. Breakfest: Not a sensation, but much better than at other locations. Danish, beagles, muffins, toast, cerials, coffee, tea, milk, juice - what else do you really need?",January 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1450,305

This is a standard looking court type hotel from the outside, but has been completely remodeled where it counts inside. The standard room is a very nice basic. And the kids suite was great, sleeping up to 8 with a bunk bed and mini couch (with its own TV) in a separate room for the kids, and the main room with 2 queen beds.  The remodeling was well done. A good Denney's restaurant is 2 door's down and the Disneyland trolley picks up in front (I do not suggest walking) We went in the spring so do not know about the concerns expressed by others about the air conditioner, but in this suite it was located in the main room. Also found soundproofing between rooms was excellent.

It was not my first choice ( I researched intensively, but in the end our travel agent booked us somewhere else so I scrambled and found Raffles)but I'm glad it was available for us. The place was clean, the staff friendly and efficient, front desk courteous and knowledgeable. We were upgraded (no extra charge) possibly someone else needed our room two queens, but with the size and age of my two kids, the room they upgraded us to was much better for all of us. We were next to the elevator and laundry room which after long days of walking it was great to have everything right there!

23 helpful votes,14 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very very Comfortable,"Our family of 5 stayed at this motel while visiting Disneyland. We had a Family Suite which was extremely spacious and comfortable. The rooms were not new and high end, however, they were very clean, comfortable and as I mentioned very roomy.The Family Suite has two rooms, one contains two queen beds and the adjoining room conected by a single french door has 1 set of bunk beds and a hide-a-bed. Each room had their own large TV and bathroom. (Bathrooms were marble counters with two sinks in each!! Just awesome)The continental breakfast included with the rooms was perfect. It was set up each morning in a bright cheerful breakfast room. There was a selection of muffins, danishes, toast, english muffins and cereal and fruit. Coffee and juice were also provided.The outdoot pool was",February 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1453,305
6 helpful votes,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Bring your own breakfast and towels,"We stayed at Raffles for 7 days during Thanksgiving week. The shuttle to Disneyland is easy to access and we had no problems with parking.  The pool was freezing and the maid service is stingy with towels. With 3 kids and 2 adults in a a suite, you would think they would remember to leave more than 3 towels each day. We constantly had to request more. The Breakfast (?) was little more than some stale muffins, terrible, generic cold cereal and bruised apples. The coffee is weak.  Bring your own fresh fruit, coffee and yogurt if you want more than just cold danish. The mgr. was friendly and helpful. The kids loved the bunk beds! Heating/cooling system is inconsistent. Rooms are nice and spacious.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1454,305
5 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Small pool but good accomadation,"We had a kids suite with three kids and two adults and give it a thumbs up. The kids loved having their own seperate room with bunks and t.v.  The fridge and micro came in handy for sure. We were there for one week and each afternoon we would come back for a break and the room would always be done up. The cont. breakfast had cereals, muffins, pastries, toast, juices etc.. If you are looking for a big pool, this one is quite small but we found it fine and never crowded. The ART bus stops right outside or you can walk to the resort in about 15 mins. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the raffles very much.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1455,305

Before we arrived I read other review and was very nervous, even to the point of taking other hotel phone numbers with me.  Well, yes the Raffles is a motel, yes parking was hard on the Saturday night. The manager told my husband they could valet park for him, that they were taking cars to their property along the road. I do not have a problem with this as they would be liable.  The room was very clean, we had the large family suite, ok it was not too large but the two bathrooms was what sold me. We had two queen beds in the main room and then bunk beds and sofa sleeper. Lots of room for just three adults and a todller.  The breakfast was adequate, toast, muffins, danish, cereal, fruit.

81 helpful votes,528 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Easy for Disney,"Stayed at the hotel 22nd thro 28th June 2003. While the hotel was clean and tidy must agree with other reveiwers that the parking is appalling and the breakfast is somewhat limited. The good point about the hotel is that you can easily use the ART and that was cheaper than driving into Disney, (2 adults $6 1 child Free) which meant once the car was parked we forgot about it for a few days. When we stayed there it seemed the American youth wanted to practise skateboarding skills on the ground floor so it made for an interesting stay. On the whole OK but you might want to consider being a little further away.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1457,305

The suite was just fine, big, 2 bedrooms, clean and in a walking distance to Disney and the conference center. The only drawback was that the heating of the pool was not working(Not a big restriction, because it was too cold anyway) and that the breakfirst was a little poor, but still OK. For the quality a very good deal compared to the price. Would go there again!",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1458,305
25 helpful votes,50 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Bring your own parking place...,"We made a reservation for two rooms, one a single king, the other a kids suite, about two months before our arrival. Upon arriving, the single king was not available and a room with two queens was substituted. We drove over to Disneyland that evening and returned about 11 p.m. to find, not only, no parking spaces, but many cars double-parked. If a fire had started the fire department would have had a difficult, and probably impossible time getting fire trucks into the central area of the property. Upon asking the management about this, they said to just give them your keys and they would move your vehicle if it was blocking someone's exit. I don't think so...
