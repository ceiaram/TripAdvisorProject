We checked-in around 4pm, so there was quite a line of people waiting. I find it interesting that you can do an online check-in at the Disneyworld hotels, but not the Disneyland hotels.

This place is utilitarian and run down. I’ve seen nicer holiday inns and if this weren’t Disneyland it wouldn’t scrape a 4 star rating. We had booked a three room suite. After a long walk to our ‘tower’ we found that 2 out of three key cards didn’t work we waited 40 minutes to rectify this. At that point (10pm) we called for room service - the only option as the restaurants are closed. We were told the wait was an hour but that we could get snacks at the tiki bar. We walked down there to find a line of people waiting to get in to the ‘full’ bar. We came back to our rooms via a vending machine on our floor. Broken.

If you want a hotel close to the park that has magical park hours this is it.  It's 1/2 mile walk from the Disney park entrances.  It's nice that you can walk to the parks come back rest and go back.  There isn't much in terms of the "" resort life for the children"".   Of course Disney wants you to spend $$ at the parks so I get that there isn't much.  No arcade, no children's activity center, No sports court, etc....   but the location is everything.  If I am rating this just on location it gets 5 stars.  But if I am rating this for amenities,  it gets three.   I am comparing this to the Disney Polynesian and Art of Animation in Orlando.

I assume it is very hard to staff this organization and you get what you get, but for the hotel enterprise, it really showed. I kept seeing so many opportunities to do things better.

Large, clean and spacious rooms. Guest services were excellent. They gladly swapped our coins for bills and posted letters and postcards (they provided the stamps as a courtesy). The theming of each of the three hotel towers was subtle but well done. It made for an enjoyable environment.  Cons: Cost.

If you have a large group going, it's worth it to book the 3 bedroom suite at the Disneyland Hotel. The layout that we got was a 2 bedroom + living room, and then the 3rd bedroom is connected to the 2nd bedroom. There were 3 full bathrooms and one 1/2 bathroom by the living area. It's pricey but if you're going to book 3 separate rooms, this ends up to be cheaper and much more spacious. Plus you have a common area to socialize with the rest of the family, in the living area.  The 3 bedroom suite can accomodate up to 14 people, but our host mentioned it's spacious enough to fit 17 people.

We had two queen beds and a sofa bed.  No complaints from anyone.  The kids enjoyed the pool and waterslide.  The kids only complaint was that the waterslide has somewhat limited hours so you can't really go to a park and enjoy the waterslide in the same day.

We went to goofys breakfast one morning and it was great.  The characters come to your table.    The only thing that is an issue is the size of the rooms.

Our family has been to WDW numerous times and stayed at many of the resorts there.  I have to say the renovated DL Hotel is my new favorite.  The Disney theme of this hotel is carried out perfectly and if you are a Disney history buff you will really enjoy it.  Everything is modern and clean.  The pool is fantastic for kids.  We loved being able to walk right out of our room in the Adventure tower and be in Downtown Disney and a short stroll to DL and DCA.

Given we only stayed a night we wanted a hotel that was well positioned to the theme parks, clean, comfortable beds and had that DIsney feeling...and it did! The renovation has hit the mark in terms of offering contemporary amenities and facilities.  The hotel upgraded our room, offered us extra fast passes and was obliging in every sense.

On a day that the crowds are 10 out of 10, being able to get in early and then easily escape for a little afternoon rest were priceless.  Now about price, this all does not come cheap.
