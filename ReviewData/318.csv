Frank and Cash were extremely helpful and friendly. Frank made checking in a breeze. Cash gave me a few near by recommendations on places to eat dinner.   The room was exactly as pictured in all the pics I saw online except I was missing a few things. I did not have a fridge or microwave (few of the reasons I chose this place). When I realized I didn't have any towels I went to call the front desk but I didn't have a phone to do so. Cash was very nice in gaving me a couple bath towels and he even mentioned he was in the process of getting a phone in my room.

This hotel was perfect for our budget-minded family.  The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the breakfast is not great, the tv has a very limited selection of channels and the wi-fi is really bad.  None of those issues were deal-breakers for us.  The Disney parks were a short 8 minute drive away and this hotel is very close to Knotts Berry Farm.

I haven't used an internet connection this slow for almost 15 years or so. In addition to being slow, the connection would be lost every 10 minutes or so.  If you spend a lot of time on the net, this is not the place for you. Although I liked my room otherwise, I will not be coming back.  The pool is small, and OK for kids but not for adults. One of the reasons I chose this place was because I wanted to swim in the evening, but that didn't work out. I guess the truth of the matter is if you want a decent sized pool, you have to pay more.

What appeared to be dried, spilled drinks and oily grease residue spotted (big spots) the walkways.

There are definitely nicer hotels in the area, but for the price, this wasn't bad. Based on the reviews, I was a bit worried. Having bad experiences at Good Nite Inn and the Buena Park Hotel and Suites, I decided to try somewhere new and less expensive than the Holiday Inn, Knott's Hotel, Courtyard and Holiday Inn nearby.  Check-in was easy. It appears as if the hotel is family owned. There was a husband and wife (?) with their young boy behind the counter at check-in.

Since we weren't planning to be in the room much and had a car, we weren't too worried about it being away from anything.  There was a liquor store and a restaurant within walking distance, but that was about all we saw in the area.    The rooms were clean and they were a decent size, but the beds were uncomfortable and the HVAC unit didn't work well, so the room got too stuffy and uncomfortable.

1 helpful vote,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Value and location. Super friendly and helpful staff,"This is a very nice little motel, clean and was convenient for us, and is great value. We walked to Knott's Berry Farm, and the pirates and Medieval Times dinner shows, all only about 15-20 minutes walk, and Disneyland is about a $30 cab ride away. I would suggest hiring a car if coming from LA airport though, as we payed about $35 each, I think, for a shuttle to disneyland, and then another $30 cab ride from there.    The free wi-fi is also a great bonus. It did have some dropping out problems, but it is more than a lot of places offer, especially at this price.
