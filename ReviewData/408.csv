The type of things that happen at other properties, do Not happen here. The bed is Very Comfortable, and the property is extremely safe and quiet. My only complaint, is that they charge too much for a weekly rate.  Other than that, I would stay here, over Motel 6 down the street, where all the alcoholic veterans stay, any day of the week. Only $65 per night. Great Deal !",March 2015,It's ALOT Better than Motel 6 !,Traveled solo,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,408

Motel 6 was full, but they pointed to this motel and said they have the exact same price and have rooms open.  When I got there I felt like I am at a 1920s hostel. It stank, the flies were unbearable, and everything was so unbelievably old and worn. But it's ok, they're cheap. Right?  Knocked on the glass. A middle-age Asian guy came to the window. He could barely put a sentence together. First he said they have no rooms. Then he thought about it for a few seconds, then said that they do. Then proceeded to charge me $80 for the night.  I looked the receipt. Looked back at the stinky old place. Told him it's too much for the conditions of the place, and that I don't think I can",September 2014,"Stay off the first street if you can't get into Motel 6.

The time being there i did not see a cleaning lady . The rooms small like cigarets . I prefer to sleep in my mini van . Not worth spending your money here. I prefer motel 6 a least .,May 2013,none,none,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,4,408
