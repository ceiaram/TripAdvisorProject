However, on the morning of 4th day, we found a leak in the ceiling that ruined our luggage and clothing. We had called the front desk to please come look at the room and where the leak was. At first, the front desk didn't even want to come to the room and would send maintenance in to check. After a second phone call, the front desk finally showed up at our door with the maintenance/engineering staff. We showed them damages to the ceiling, our luggage and clothing, and they offered to arrange to move us to another room for the duration of our stay.

I use your hotels whilst travelling with work, so many of these facilities are vital. Whilst some of the missing facilities were offered by a neighbouring hotel, it was still very inconvenient, and some weren’t available at all. I have stayed in many hotels this year, so I don’t accept ‘covid’ as an excuse.  For example: - breakfast. A very limited/poor option was available at another hotel. - Gym. A very poor gym was available at another hotel. - Pool & Spa. Again available at the neighbour hotel but was very unclean so I avoided it.  - Laundry. I had to drive elsewhere.

It is to my understanding that none of the issues you have described here were brought up to my attention throughout your stay until the day of departure when you had sought out compensation.  When we weren't able to fulfill your intentions, you called Hilton Guest Assistance and further added issues that were never brought to our attention including the breakfast attendant being rude.    As a General Manager, issues will arise on a daily basis.  However, if issues are brought up to us in a timely manner, I assure not only you, but all of our travelers, that we will exceed the expectations of not only resolving the issue but turn a frown, into a smile.  I am sorry that you had felt being a Diamond tier guest you can get whatever compensation you needed without being questioned.  Your loyalty is most appreciated but no effort was given to us to resolve until the moment you were departing which does not give us much room to make an attempt to resolve it for you to your satisfaction.

The rooms and complimentary continental breakfast were okay.  And everything seemed clean (although one small issue was that there was a leak in the bathroom).   But...

The biggest problem was that when I informed the hotel staff of the issues, I experienced resistance to helping resolve the issue, rather than eagerness to help resolve the issue. We checked in late at night and were placed in a king bed room with a chair, even though I reserved a king room with a sofa bed.

118 helpful votes,84 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great value and super friendly staff,"We stayed here for a few nights while some work was done at our house.  We stayed at a Hampton Inn last Summer while driving through Ohio and the experience was very nice and we expected the same.  We were not disappointed.  Everyone was super nice, including the guys installing new carpet in the hallway.  The daily breakfast was quite good with a wide variety of items (even a to-go bag if we were running late).  The hotel was very clean - even the pool - and comfortable.  It is conveniently located and priced lower than most of the others in the area.  The mini frig and microwave in room were handy.  The only improvement I would like to see is higher end televisions in the room.  I highly recommend this hotel!",May 2010,none,none,"Thank you for your genorous and thoughtful comments.  We sincerely appreciate your patience during the work that was taking place at our hotel.

This hotel is about 20 minutes from Disneyland and way cheaper then the Disney hotels.  Close to the beach as well.  Staff was friendly, breakfast area was clean and rooms were always clean when we returned at the end of the day. Several places to dine nearby in the evening.

none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Fair price for the stay,"Room is decent, daily turn down service is nice, fresh towels everyday. Breakfast is decent and convenient, staff is friendly. Internet needs a bit of work, extremely low bandwidth and very unstable connectability. Parking was ample, never had a long walk to the hotel even late at night. Location was great, could not have been happier with that. Over all I like the hotel but since I was here for a school, I had training videos to watch as homework and was unable to do so because of the connection. So when I come back out in a few months I may have to pick somewhere else, but that would be the only reason I would.",September 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,532,278
79 helpful votes,56 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A Very Pleasant Stay,"I highly recommend this hotel.  We were on a family vacation and enjoyed our 3 night stay.  The room was clean and neatly decorated.  The bed was comfortable.  You feel pampered with all the amenities offered. A decent hot breakfast every morning.  Great pool and jacuzzi.  This hotel is located in a quiet corporate area with lots of eateries nearby, locate just minutes from Laguna Beach, San Juan Capistrano, and other Orange County attractions.  Although the Freeway is close, noise was not a factor.  This freeway is a toll road, and is a pain having to pay coming and going (we found an alternate route). We will definitely stay here again.",July 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,533,278

This is your standard, to-be-expected hotel chain. It was too cold to enjoy the pool, but the lobby area is nice with lots of meeting room area for talking.  The breakfast is nice with sausage, egg ""patties"", your standard pastries and baked goods, yogurt, and fruit. The coffee is available 24 HOURS a day!  The location is central with many of the local attractions close by. Although I've never stayed in the next door Hilton Garden Inn, I would probably stay here again since there is the free breakfast, coffee, and the cheaper price.",May 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,534,278
8 helpful votes,156 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hotel for a cheap price,Another great stay  This hotel is very clean and the check in process took about 30 seconds. I'm a hilton honors gold card member and I have stayed at this hotel 10-15 times in the last few years. If you have a choice make sure you pick this hotel over the hilton garden inn right next door. The garden inn is does not offer free breakfast the haptton inn does. The hampton inn always has clean rooms and the best beds the best in the hotel industry. Make sure your book through hilton's web site you will get the best price. Use your AAA card and you will get a better discount on your room.,March 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,535,278
82 helpful votes,75 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A very pleasant stay,"I am a frequent traveler with Hilton and before my recent stay I had never stayed at a Hampton Inn. I am rather picky about the hotels I choose to stay at and Hampton Inns have never attracted me. However, this property was very close to where I wanted to be and was cheaper then the neighboring Hilton Garden Inn so I decided to try it.   I was amazed at the quality of the room, service, and comfort that usually only four/five star hotels provide. The hotel is obviously very new (you can smell the scent of new carpet/wallpaper throughout the hotel). Check-in was less than 30 seconds, the hotel was spotless, the bed was very comfortable (I am almost tempted to buy the same mattress for myself) and the front desk was very helpful and friendly.

231 helpful votes,861 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good location,"We stayed here because we had our return flight out of John Wayne Airport. It was very easy to get to the airport from this Hampton Inn. The rooms were very clean.  The bedspreads were dark and made the room seem old upon entering.  The breakfast was excellent.  They had hot and cold cereals, sausage and biscuits and scrambled eggs.  They also had a nice bowl of fresh prepared fruit and a basket with a choice of apples or bananas.   These stayed out all day long. You also had a choice of a couple of varieties of Yoplait Yogurt.   You can also get coffee, hot tea or hot chocolate all day.  The breakfast area was well kept and the cook came out often to check on the food, and replenish items.    We stayed two nights there and both nights the jets on the hot tub were not working.",January 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,537,278
