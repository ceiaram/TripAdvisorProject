none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Stay!,My stay at Hyatt House was very comfortable and restful. It is located in a safe area. The staff was helpful and responded quickly to questions and requests. The room had everything one would need including a microwave and a nice size mini-fridge. The weather was rainy so I couldn’t enjoy the balcony but it appeared to be a nice size for two to three people to enjoy.

Seating was uncomfortable (sunken in sofa bed couch), awkward set up with the door to the bedroom when open blocked the TV from most of the living area. why have a room that is ADA accessible with no proper seating or workspace? Shades (which were automatic but didn’t work properly) were stained, ripped and didn’t even completely close. If you can call the outside a patio (slab of uneven concrete) no furniture to sit out and am open wall of bushes, there is no usage to the “patio”. And why have a slider you cant keep open to let the fresh air in since there is no screen? Pointless. Walls are thin and doors slam shut. Half of the TV stations lose signal.

Staff were courtesy, always helpful and the hotel (both in and outside) were being cleaned nonstop.  The only downfall of this stay were the rude guests who were there and the nonstop partying they were having at the pool.  My recommendation to the hotel:  shift the pool hours from 10-10pm to 9am - 9pm.   Quiet hours are supposed to start at 9pm, but when you have a pool open until 10pm, you invited unruly guests to stay there until 10pm.  Staff tried to quiet them down, but to no avail.   Again, not the fault of the hotel for having rude guests, but there is a solutions to prevent this from happening again.

Nice outdoor courtyard with fire pits though the cushions on the furniture are well past time to replace.

Which often means noisy groups in the courtyard and pool in the evenings, and loud crowded breakfasts. Especially thru the summer months.  So ask for a room that does not face the courtyard.

I enjoy the space in the suites and the breakfast provided with many options in a space that never appeared to get crowded. But what I like about this Hyatt House in particular was its location. It's close enough to Disneyland as to be convenient for your visit but far enough away that you don't have all the traffic and noise that you have closer to Disney. It is slightly off the main drag providing a peaceful setting without being remote, not something easily found in Anaheim and environs.

A room for myself and husband and teenage son worked out perfectly with a separate bedroom and roomy living area. The only thing to mention is that the construction of the sinks/faucets is a bit off. The spout in the kitchen sink and vanity sink does not come out far enough and therefore water hits the countertops and makes a mess each time. Also the shower door does not close completely which creates a flood on the floor and you have to be sure the bathmat catches the overflow. The staff is very helpful and pleasant.

On the first floor, people smoke right on their patio, so if you are next door and want to open the windows, you can smell the smoke.

I had to nip this in the bud because driving to vacation destinations was getting old fast. I made a deal that if I drove two days to Orlando last year she could pick where we went this year but we had to fly. She chose Disneyland and Hollywood so off we went this year.

We stayed a further 10 nights from 20th July. room 317. At first we were a little dissapointed with a view of the Parking lot but we asked them if they could arrange a pool view on our return from Vegas. They explained they could not promise but would try their best. On our return we had a lovely room with a nice balcony table and 2 chairs with a pool view. room much nicer than on our first stay. We did a deal with Nick the reservations Manager and we were very happy with the agreed rate.Beautiful room usual refinements for a suite Full Kitchen nice Lounge area with Huge Plasma in Lounge and smaller one in bedroom.

Bedroom with privacy doors also had a flat screen T.V., King bed and the bathroom had plenty of room. Continental Breakfast was FANTASTIC !! It saves a family money while traveling.     We stayed here for our Annual Disneyland trip. The hotel is about 10 mins. from the park so we had to drive & pay to park at Disney ($12.00) good all day . Woodfin does have a shuttle to the park, but it leaves at one time in the morning and returns at one time in the evening. Beds were super comfortable and room was very clean. Service & Hotel staff were very kind. we would stay here again in a heartbeat !",July 2009,none,none,Thank you for your response on your recent stay at the Woodfin Hotel in Cypress. We are glad you and your family enjoyed your stay in our newly renovated king suite which is very accommodating to families on vacations. Our location being only 7 miles away from Disneyland is also key for families who do not want to deal with the Disney Traffic.

My one disappointment was the plumbing in our room. The toilet never worked properly throughout our stay. The maintenance man came 2 times. I had to use the public bathroom down the hall. The toilet just wouldn't flush.  The hotel has a shuttle to Disney Land which we used 2 days. We drove the last day when we discovered that the shuttle won't run after 9:30 pm and we didn't want to miss the DisneyLand fireworks.  I recommend staying here. I'm sure the plumbing is fixed by now. I'd definately stay here again with my family. The price was reasonable.

The hotel was kept in good shape...very clean and nicely decorated.   The lobby had a nice sitting area in front of a gas fireplace next to a conference room/library with a large table and comfortable business chairs.  Did not have any problems so could not put the service to the test on how they would handle situations.  We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with a nice kitchen and a large living room.   The flat screen television sets (one in the bedroom and one in the living room) were cool to have.  One thing about having rooms with kitchens was that I would always smell someone cooking curry as I walked though the hallway.

The breakfast downstairs was a full on breakfast, nice change from the ""Continental"" breakfasts at most places. Loved having a kitchen. Loved the suite, my friend stays up late so I could close the door and go to bed early. Staff was very helpful and very nice. Room was really clean and the AC worked like a dream. I have nothing bad to say. They lock the front door late at night so you need your key to enter at side entrances. We went to store late and came back to a locked front entrance, we laughed about getting ""home"" too late and ""mom"" locking us out of the house.

The furniture is old, the bathroom is basically right in the bedroom so if one person is using the sink, the light and noise will keep the other person awake.  The rooms could use better lighting, and the Internet access is an extra charge.   There is a mangers reception four nights a week so if you are there Friday through Sunday, you miss the reception.

Carpet was absolutely filthy, something I would have expected a $70 motel, but not acceptable in a place like this.  Air conditioner/heater only had one setting which sounded like a tornado in the room.  The Ethernet cable was located on the opposite side of the room from the ""desk” which made it impossible for me to work comfortably on my laptop.

I was booked for the second floor, and my room was lackluster.  The linoleum floor looked 80s and the sofa couch was a bit faded.  The sofa cushion's zipper was broken.  The soaps melted easily when wet.  The toilet flooded on more than one occasion while we stayed there and we were told we could use the restroom in the front of the building.  I'm sorry, but I am a woman and I don't do my dirty deeds in public restrooms.  The maintenance guy came in and worked on the toilet, but left it wet.
