The 2-floor property sits behind the main house amidst greenery and a lovely little fountain.  A highlight was the hummingbird who built a nest overhead (well-protected by a big leaf).    Every morning, the inn keeper, Bill, appeared at the door with a sumptuous breakfast which he delivered to our cottage's table.  The unit had a refrigerator and a plug-in 2 burner cooktop, and a whole host of kitchen appliances and dishes.  Dinner meals on a small scale were easy to put together.
