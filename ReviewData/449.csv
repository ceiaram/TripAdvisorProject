Refrig that kept my stuff cold.  little microwave.  bathroom was newly updated. quiet... i heard no noise through the walls. i heard no voices outside my window.  comfy bed.  it was a great bargain.  I travel a lot, stay in a lot of hotels.  I ended up at this hotel by chance.  I was bothered by no one and had no problems. This is a budget hotel, the kind where you park outside your door. it was a very good bargain for the price.",November 2019,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,449

86 helpful votes,198 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clean and quiet, well located at a crossroads, at a nice low price","I was in Huntington Beach on business, not pleasure, so I wasn't looking for a luxurious hotel or to be on the sand, just a nice, cost-effective place to stay for two nights.  I found this motel to fill the bill just fine--the price was quite quite low, it was located at a kind of crossroads, on Beach Boulevard that makes a bee-line from the 405 freeway to the Pacific Coast Highway and the ocean, and on the same block as the diagonal Main Street, so it felt like all of Huntington Beach was easily accessible.  Despite being on a ""main drag"", I felt that the room was very quiet.  Every reference calls this motel ""Starlight Inn"", except the sign in front that says ""Rodeway Inn"".  I can only guess that maybe Rodeway bought the motel, but the transition to the new name is proceeding",October 2015,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,449
24 helpful votes,52 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Wouldn't stay here again!,We booked this motel thru Booking.com under the name Starlight Inn Huntington Beach and spent ages trying to find it as they have changed the name outside to Rodeway Inn and we thought we were at the wrong place. It wasnt till we got a call on our cell phone to find out why we hadnt booked in that we realised we were at the right motel. The owners were rude and unhelpful when I asked why we werent notified of the name change.The room was adequate and the beds were average. The whole place is quite run down and we had to carry our bags up stairs to the third floor.It was averagely clean.

5 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Awful!!!,"We travelled on a budget holiday here as part of a group. Honestly, this was easily the worst place we stayed by far.  We were arriving late, so made sure to ring in advance, owner seemed very thankful for the call, and said it was no problem to check in late. When we arrived, there was no sign of the owner. We rang the bell numerous times, and called the phone, to no avail. After about 10-15 minutes standing in the dark, we contemplated just sleeping in our cars.  The owner then turned up, with no apology for the delay, and barely spoke to us during out check in. However, it was late, so we didn't really mind.  Then the nightmare started! As we brought in our bags, a drunk man attempted to come in to our room.

I don't smoke but he was nice enough to let me look at the room to check it out. I did a quick look just see how bad the smell was and it wasn't that bad. He told me it was going to be 84 but gave it to me for 75. I really should of took a better look at the room first.

We didn't expect the best and the first impression was slightly ok (no Cockroaches). But the bathroom was really dirty and smelled like an ash tray. The first night was ok because 75 dollars are cheap for 5 people and we decided to stay another night and then the real nightmare began. We had nearly 30 bed bugs killed until we moved out.
