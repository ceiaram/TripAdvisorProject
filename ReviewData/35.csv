The sink is outside of the toilet/shower room, which I like.   Bed was not the most comfortable, but was ok, and I loved the pillows.  The people at the front desk were super nice, and helpful.  They stored our luggage both on check-in day, when we arrived early and our room was not ready but we wanted to go to the parks, and on check-out day, when it was time to check out but we  still had time to visit the parks before we needed to go to the airport.

Also within walking distance to the Downtown Disney Shopping center, the Gardenwalk shopping center, and all of the great restaurants the resort area has to offer.  We are not always able to offer parking after check out, technically the parking expires at 11:00AM on the day of departure.  When our staff notices the lot is not going to be full however, we are happy to let our guest keep the car here longer.  If we can help our guests save the $35 to park at Disney, that means they can buy an extra churro!

The bed was extremely uncomfortable, very hard, and it was topped with a sheet and paper thin blanket. It was so loud constantly had people running by and yelling or having loud conversations from 5am-11pm. We didn’t get any sleep during our stay. The room was comparable to Motel 6 and i wasn’t expecting it to be super nice but the pictures made it look much newer and nicer than it was. My only positive is that the hotel staff was great, super friendly and helpful when we needed additional things. The location was good but there are plenty of better choices around.

We booked a family suite, one room had two double beds and a sink, the other room had a king bed.  The extra sink was handy as a family of 5. The rooms were basic, but adequate.  Sheets are pilling, but clean.  We didn't notice any surrounding noise, nights were quiet, and the fridge and microwave were great to have for breakfasts in the room and random snacks/drinks.  The vending machine close to our room was out of service, so stocking drinks was a must in the heat.  The rooms were oddly humid, considering how hot and dry it is.

As explained in the review, the hotel is focused on providing our guests with a very comfortable stay, and we hope to have everything a guest will need during a vacation.

The hotel also provides the coin operated washers and dryers, a very conveniently located swimming pool area, and a sun deck in the pool area with a couple of tables and chairs.  The Castle Inn & Suites is one of the only hotels located across the street from Disneyland to continue to offer free parking for one vehicle per room, free Wi Fi in the room, and to not charge a resort fee.  The location of the hotel is also very tough to beat, within a 5 to 7 minute walk from the entrance of both parks.  The hotel is also less than a 10 minute walk from the Convention Center, and just a half block from the Gardenwalk Shopping center.  Though the gift shop is closed, it will not be permanent.  The hotel used to provide notepads and pens in the room, but out of an abundance of caution, all materials that cannot be sanitized have been removed.  Once we are on the right path again, those smaller touches will be brought back.  The alarm clocks are a great touch, with 2 outlets plus 2 USB charging ports, it is usually sufficient for all devices.

Great location - wish it had better soundproofing.,"Every time I come to Disneyland I stay at another hotel in search of the of the one I want to return to. While this spot was perfectly adequate... I'm going to need to keep searching. The most important thing to note is it's a lot more like a motel than a hotel.

If you're a budget traveler who doesn't mind a lack of frills, this is perfectly fine.  The good: the best part about this hotel is its location, 100 percent.  It is a short walk to Disneyland (8-10 minutes) and the importance of its proximity cannot be understated.

Our staff works diligently every day to provide each of our guests with a positive experience, we are sure we could have helped improve your stay.  Each room is furnished with 4 sets of towels, though two of them are folded on a towel rack near the sink and two others are inside of the restroom.  In the past some of our guests only notice one of the areas or the other.  We are more than happy to deliver any items to the room that a guest may need such as extra towels, blankets, coffee, or any of the other in-room amenities.  The front desk is available 24 hours per day to help guests with any concerns.  One solution may have been to move to another location so we could have our maintenance and housekeeping staff enter the room to fix the issues you have reported.  We can help to coordinate the move at any time that may be convenient for the guest.  If we are made aware in the morning, we could set aside a new room that will be ready for you when you return to the hotel.  Even if it is late in the evening, the room will be ready and waiting for you.  While we understand you could have had a better experience, we hope you will understand that this was an anomaly, not the normal experience that our guests have.  We hope that you change your mind and decide to give the hotel another opportunity to provide you with a better experience in the future.

We think there are all kinds of things that make this hotel special.  The exterior of the hotel is shaped like a castle, and the theme is carried throughout the property.  There are gargoyles with eyes that light up, a stained-glass window with a knight fighting a dragon, a suit of armor, and all kinds of little touches that help this property stand out from the other square buildings on the street.  The interior of the rooms are not like one would find in a real castle, they would be to cold, there would be no amenities, and most likely no restroom.  Instead our hotel rooms are furnished with rich fabrics and dark furniture to provide the feel of a castle, yet with modern amenities.  Each room features a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker and a hair dryer.  When you include the free parking, free Wi Fi, and No Resort Fees, there is really no better value to be had near the Disneyland Resort.

Since there is no breakfast at the hotel we picked-up Starbucks each morning before heading to the parks. There is a Starbucks, Walgreens, and CVS just down from the hotel. There is also a Denny's if you want a full breakfast before heading to parks close by as well. We ate dinner at one of the small restaurants next door one night which was pretty good. Our room was dark, but we didn't spend much time in the room, so it wasn't a big deal. The beds were clean and comfortable.

The pool and hot tub were highlights for my girls and the staff were really helpful and accommodating.  The rooms are small and basic but well laid out.  The hotel was pretty full when we visited but I didn't hear anyone through the walls at all.  Either our neighbours were really silent or this hotel has great sound proofing.  My guess is the latter.  I came to this hotel in 1990 as a kid and it was neat to return with my kids in 2021.

9 helpful votes,25 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Words speak volume....,Be aware that they will not guarantee a ground floor room and will try to convince you that no hotel will. We need a ground floor for disability purposes which is why we request it all the time when traveling and try not to take an accessible room when we don't need the features of one and leave those rooms for those that truly need it. So by requesting a regular standard room on a ground floor works well for everyone and many hotels are more than happy to do so.  They tried to tell me that no hotels will guarantee a ground floor when in fact there are many hotels that will as we travel multiple times a year for pleasure and medical purposes staying in a variety of hotels and rarely have come across one that refuses to guarantee a ground floor like they do.

While we cannot guarantee a room located on the ground floor, we can always place a request on the reservation and our staff will make every effort to meet the request.

When a guest books a room at the Castle Inn & Suites, we guarantee to hold the room for the guest's arrival.  This means that even if the guest is arriving late in the evening, we will not cancel the reservation.  However, we cannot guarantee the room will be located in a specific location as due to some unforeseen circumstances, we may not be able to place the room in the desired location.  We apologize if there was a misunderstanding, and if we did not meet your expectations by not guaranteeing the room on the ground floor.  Our staff has reported they offered a room type which has a roll in shower, which is only located on the ground floor and would therefore satisfy this request.

Nothing to plug my phone into. It’s 2021!! 5 year olds have cell phones. What hotel in this day and age doesn’t have at least one outlet between the beds?

This motel does exactly what you need it to do and that is provide a safe, somewhat quiet and comfortable place for you to rest between your visits to the parks.  There aren’t too many properties with this proximity so if that’s what you want, that’s what Castle Inn will provide.  This is a motel, which is defined as having no interior hallways.  If that bothers you, look elsewhere.  This kind of place can get a bit noisy but if you sleep well, or bring earplugs (which I always do when I travel), it should be no big deal.

Overall, it was a decent hotel and could be one of my go-to hotels in the area when I visit Disneyland, which I do every 1-2 months.  However, it had one major issue that I can't ignore.....the noise!  The hotel itself is fairly nice--clean, good amenities like fridge and microwave oven in the room, etc.  Price per night is reasonable and there is plenty of parking that is free too!  Usually, the hotels within a short walking distance to the parks charge for parking ($15-30 per night) and there aren't enough parking spots for the guests.  Hence, if you come back to the hotel after 9 pm, good luck finding a spot!",December 2019,none,none,"We would like to thank you for taking the time to post a detailed review of our recent stay.

We would like to clear up a few items in the review that are not accurate.  The décor in the rooms was selected to reflect a castle theme, with rich colors and dark furniture.  The hotel offers on site parking for our guests with a limit of one vehicle per registered room on the nights the room is reserved.  The terms of parking state that parking expires at the check out time (11:00AM) on the date of departure.  However, as a courtesy the front desk offered to extend that time until 3:00PM.  We apologize if this courtesy did not meet your expectations.  As one of the last hotels in the area to offer free parking we make every effort to ensure our guests with reservations will have a parking spot available upon arrival.  Many other hotels will allow a vehicle to remain as they are charging for each night the vehicle is on site, including an additional charge for the check out day.  The staff makes every effort to accommodate our guests needs, and will continue to strive to provide the best customer service possible.

Quiet (at least during our 2 nights on third floor halfway between the 2 elevator banks)   Cons:  Pool is small and sits in the middle of the parking lot (we did not use pool but it did not look inviting).

It's incredibly rare to find a room that will comfortably sleep a large family. If you want a safe affordable place to sleep after a long day at the park minus the amenities this is the place. But I will recommend reserving rooms on partner sites. I always booked through Expedia but was told during one stay they offer a discount to re-occurring guests if you book directly through them.

We may consider adding pool towels in the future; however, most of our guest just take their towels from their room and have them replenished after their time at the pool.  Like many hotels, we have valued employees that cherish their jobs, and would not jeopardize their employment by taking guest item's.  Guests have left laptops, cell phones, wedding rings and many other very expensive items in their rooms and we personally mail these items back to our guests via priority mail.  We have even discovered items left in the room and phone the guest before they call us, which many guests have commented on this service right here on trip advisor. We hope that maybe they have turned up, or perhaps the earbuds were left at Disneyland or somewhere else during your visit in Anaheim.  Again, thank you for providing your review.

The room rates were contracted in advance with the convention, which does not allow us to change the rate for attendees due to the contract.  All guests who booked through the convention received the same rate.   Due to the changing supply and demand for hotel rooms in the area, rates are dynamic, fluctuating day to day or even changing from one hour to the next.

We could easily close the door to the large bedroom.  Decent size mini fridge and microwave were included in the suite.    The room wasn't dirty but furnishings and carpet seemed old and dingy.  I didn't find the beds to be comfortable at all.  Personal preference I suppose.    I did not enjoy the varying water temperatures while taking a shower.   Be ready to jump out of the water stream at any given moment.  Good point = easy walk to Disney.  I would guess about a mile from room door to turnstiles.

Hotel's have standard operating procedures when it comes to guest safety.  Any guest asking for a key to be re-issued for any reason, would need their ID to be checked against the records on file.  Not only does this protect you the Guest, it protects the Hotel.  If you travel anywhere and a hotel re-issues you a key without checking your ID, you should be very concerned.

The other room had been blocked immediately after you reported that you had found one bug so the inspector got in there and checked the entire room, again, before it was re-rented: under the bed, behind the pictures, in the bathroom, everywhere. She was even on her hands and knees looking but found nothing. She also checked the housekeeping carts and the sheets on the beds in the room that you had been moved to and once again, found nothing.

We had them come out, as well, to check the room and they were unable to find anything.

Someone was sent to fix the problem, but he just used (WD40 - a lubricant), which didn't fix the problem.

We are sorry to hear that you were dissatisfied with your visit but would like to let you know that we do take all comments seriously and have looked into those you mentioned.  In reference to our rooms keys, our locks and doors are very safe and secure.   Should you have brought the issues you wrote about to our attention while you were here, we would have been more than happy to bring you more pillows, a new comforter, a new refrigerator or simply, we could have switched you to a new room.   Regarding the fuse going out, it was actually the GFI Electrical circuit, as required by building code and therefore, is made for the ease of resetting.  The desk clerk who helped you that night was doing so, by phone, because being that it does take only a few seconds to hit the reset button, that person figured that most guests, such as yourself, would like to reset it themselves rather than wait for maintenance to get to the room. This was probably of importance since it was after 11:00 p.m. and you had been at Disneyland all day.   I am sure that you are aware that occasionally elevators seem to have problems and ours happen to have its problem while you were here. It was actually fixed quickly, without incident or other complaints.  Last, we wanted to address your comments about whoever checked you in not being in a uniform:  our staff, especially our front desk staff, is always in a regulation uniform, while our managers  wear appropriate business attire.
