A passageway and plant pots separated our room from the car park.   Room - Our room was disappointingly small and the shower room was tiny. Storage space is minimal, a small cupboard with 5 clothes hangers, a shelf and one drawer in a bedside table was insufficient for garments. Our belongings remained in our cases which we had to walk around on the floor. With no storage in the bathroom our toiletries were placed on a stool in front of the loud air conditioning unit.   The drapes are thin and we kept them closed to maintain some privacy, our room could be viewed by motel passers-by.

We really enjoyed the convenient location and parking, and the price is excellent considering the location. You can access the beach on both sides of the hotel easily.

The living space features a sitting area (two chairs, futon, a high top bar table with two stools) with a kitchenette (microwave, sink, mini-fridge).

We were in a queen/ocean view and the balcony was great. For the price, the view was fine. You do see some roofs, but again, not a huge deal when you still have the ocean in the background.
