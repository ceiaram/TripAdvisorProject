We were staying here for the National Championship Football game and we wanted to be near Santa Ana airport.    The property is located down the street from the Disneyland entrance. I walked each day to get more exercise but it’s over .8 mile away. Many hotels are on the same street but closer. The hotel’s rooms are getting quite old and probably need a remodel soon. Although - the rooms are nicely sized and included a large supply of towels, shampoo etc.  Breakfast is not included in the rate but I get 2 free breakfasts nightly due to my Bonvoy status. The breakfast was very good.   Staff were nice. They did not provide daily housekeeping unless you stayed more than 2 days. My safe never worked properly even after maintenance “fixed” it.

It very well may be but you are walking over the 405. There are closer hotels. The hotel is good about allowing you to leave your vehicle while you visit Disneyland so you save on parking at Disneyland. There is a $5 shuttle ticket you can purchase if you don’t want to walk but it only comes every 25-30 minutes. We chose to walk to and from Disneyland. There is also the option of taking an Uber which is about $6.  You can tell the hotel was an older hotel that had been remodeled. I found our room to be modern and clean.

As others have mentioned, the view of the fireworks is unbeatable (especially when compared with watching them at the park itself, where you have to fight with crowds of people to get a good view).    Unfortunately.  You don't get to hear the soundtrack or see the castle projection images, so you do lose a lot of the effect of the firework show.  They're still impressive, nonetheless.    Some reviews have laser-focused on the minor chips and scrapes in the building.  I, personally, didn't find the hotel to be ""dirty"" at all.  I thought it was kept up quite nicely.

The hotel is a bit run down but looks similar to all the other hotels in the area and is in process of an upgrade. We had a ground floor room on the quiet side and we were fine with the sound. All hotels in this area are next to a major road so I would ignore most noise reviews. The room had no carpet which was odd but everything else was standard and fine. The room was cleaned each day and our towels changed and bed made. The hotel is a short walk to disney and a lot of food places.

My major problem is the hotel labelling itself as a boutique hotel when I feel like it is just a few steps up from a motel. The rooms have been renovated recently but the work seems a bit shoddy (you can see paint drips, bathroom fixtures not installed properly). The rooms themselves feel a bit small. The toilet and shower area is separate from the sink area which I didn't mind but the fact that the coffee and tea station were on the bathroom vanity meant a lot less counter space. There was also no towel rack for hand towels or designated space for the mini fridge which just sat out in the open taking up more floor space.

However other than the distance to Disney there are things where I wasn't impressed with and visitors should be aware of. This hotel is more like a motel than a hotel. Even though it was ""renovated"", the renovation probably only updated with new bed frame and sink area. The whole bathroom including the bath tub was very old.

The second is yet the fireworks are loud - that's simply because it's right across the freeway from where the fireworks go off (you're closer to the fireworks than many places in Disneyland!) - this however can be a big advantage (read below).

The wifi was the worst we experienced the whole time in the US we complained and they said they would fix it, then they said it was because we were too high up, why have wifi if it isn't accessible to the whole hotel?

The next day was my birthday and I barely had the energy to go to Disneyland. We asked to move and the next room was better, but still lots of noise.

The other reviews said the hotel was noisy because of the 24 hour pool and the proximity to the freeway.  We had a room facing the pool so we did not hear the traffic noise.  We also heard no pool noise for the first 4 nights.  Night 5 was ridiculous.  I didn't mind people being in the pool but the blaring rap music was unbearable.  Night 6 also resulted in me calling the front desk to complain about the neighbors.  They had a dog and it was barking and crying.

Great view of the fireworks at night from the secluded tropical feeling pool area. A shout out to Eric at front desk, super accommodating gentlemen. Very helpful staff in general. The American tavern was well priced and very nice menu (especially after paying $65 for some generic hamburgers and chicken strips in Disney).

We imaged it would be average, but as we were only in Anaheim for a couple of days to do the theme parks, we didn’t really care.  What a surprise!  This place was clean, friendly and had a few little extra’s you don’t get in the larger and more expensive hotels.  Beside free WI FI they also had computers with free internet (I had trouble with my smart phone) and really good flat screen TV’s.

I am sorry to hear that you have had unpleasant experiences with our front desk staff; your comments will be addressed with our team.   It is standard protocol in the hotel industry to authorize each guest's credit card for the full amount of your stay, as well as an additional hold for incidentals. This is only an authorization, in the case that a guest may charge room service, or food & beverage from the hotel restaurant and bar to their room tab. All hotels take this ""Incidentals Authorization,"" however, the amount of the hold may be different per that hotel's specific policy.   If, when you check out of the hotel, you have not charged any incidentals to your room, the authorized amount is released back to the credit card. Your bank may take up to 10 business days to release the funds back into your account (this time period is determined by your bank).  I hope this helps to explain the amount we authorized for incidentals, then released after your check-out. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me directly.

Chose this location based on favorable reviews, location, and price. Let's start with the many positives: great location if you are looking for something close to park. Price was less compared to others just a couple blocks down Harbor Blvd. Service is fabulous. Room was what you would expect at this price point, and was very clean. Downsides?

The real noise, however, was the blaring music coming from the pool area (our room faced the pool) until 10:00 pm. We were there on chilly Sunday and Monday nights and there was no one - exactly zero people - in the pool area either night - so we totally don't understand the rationale for making the rest of the guests miserable.

We have our laundry outsourced to an outside company, and have brought this incident to the laundry company's attention as well.

Things I didn't like so much: I never stayed at a hotel that couldn't provide two cribs for my twins. I understand they run low but never had this problem. That was a struggle. I don't like the fact you have to pay for parking and pay for the ART to Disneyland. Although you can walk..... when you have a double stroller, back pack etc its not easy and not to safe crossing the freeway entrance and exit on the overpass.

I apologize that your guest room was not in an ideal location in the hotel; we do our best to place our guests staying multiple nights in the more quiet locations of the property. Parking fees are common in most resort locations, and we have priced our parking fees to be competitive for the Anaheim area - $10 self parking, $12 valet. The ART shuttle is a separate business, not associated with Hotel Menage. They do maintain a very convenient stop right outside our front doors, and the cost seems fair for the service they offer - $5 adults, $2 children, for all day use around the city.

4 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Horrible customer service!,"We have a few complaints about our stay at Menage from Oct. 14-19.  We stayed there previously and had a good experience, but this time around there were many things wrong, and when we addressed our concerns, the manager on duty was not helpful or sympathetic.  We will NOT be returning.  First, when we arrived at 6:30 pm and went up to our room, there was someone in there, a maid, telling us the shower didn't work.  We would expect that with a check in time that late, everything would be in order, but it was not.  Second, we were disappointed the restaurant K'ya was not available.  We had enjoyed this aspect of the hotel during our previous stay and it was a main reason we chose to stay there again.  Nothing on the website or otherwise indicated it would be closed.  Third, our",October 2012,none,none,"Dear Kristin H,  I am so sorry to hear what a frustrating week you had with us, especially considering you had chosen to re-book after a previously pleasant stay.   I would like to personally apologize for the miscommunication between our housekeeping and front desk staff in allowing you and your family to check into a room which was under maintenance. As you probably understand, things can occasionally break down or go wrong in any space that gets used and abused as much as a hotel room does, however, you are absolutely right; you should not have been given keys to a guest room under maintenance. This has been discussed with the appropriate departments and I assure you we will not let this happen again.  Even though our K'ya Street-fare dining room was closed for remodeling, we still offered our full menu and dining options in our lobby seating area (just outside the dining room). Our kitchen was open for business as usual. It was only the dining room which was closed for renovation, and has since been completed and re-opened as the new American Tavern.  My apologies for the chilly pool... we must occasionally empty the pool for deep cleaning and refill it. It takes a short time to get back to temperature, but I'm sure all our guests appreciate a clean and sanitary pool when they stay with us. Also, I regret that the elevators can get uncomfortable on a hot day; luckily no one has to spend a substantial amount of time in them, as they do not have air conditioning.  The music we play around the pool area is typically turned down between 9:30 and 10pm. As with most hotels, we consider it very important to maintain a ""Quiet Time"" between the hours of 10pm until 8am. I'm so sorry if the music was loud later than 10pm!  Regarding the misunderstanding with the city's ART Shuttle, they have been promoting their new line, #18, on the tickets they sell, and I can see how this may have been confusing. What I can't figure out is how you ended up finding the bus #18, as this line does not pick up or drop off at Disneyland. The only lines that pick up at Hotel Menage are #10 and #11, and the bus number is clearly posted on each bus. The hotel is not responsible for any guest who gets on the wrong shuttle when leaving the park. The shuttle drivers are very knowledgeable about their stops and the Anaheim area, and are more than happy to answer any questions you may have upon boarding or riding the shuttle. There are also route maps that clearly define the shuttle stops according to bus number at every major shuttle stop around the Disneyland area. I believe our Manager on Duty acted according to hotel policy. We do not refund guests for the ART shuttle when they mistakenly board the wrong bus. I do apologize if she seemed unsympathetic to your situation - I can imagine how angry you must have been to find out the bus you were on was headed in the opposite direction of Hotel Menage, and the frustration you experienced in walking over a mile with a couple of tired, young children after a day in the park! This is definitely not the way any parent wants to conclude their day at Disneyland with their children.  We appreciate your candid comments. I feel terrible that you and your family had a bad experience at Hotel Menage, and we are truly sorry to lose your future business.

The pool and jacuzzi is nice. I got a standard two queen bed room. The room layout is similar to a motel 6 room but slightly bigger and decorated. Breakfast was a buffet and they provide more than you can eat. Dinner was a little spendy for the amount of food you get. I only ate dinner once while I was there. The hotel is close to Disney but you will still want to take a shuttle. I tried walking it both ways the first day and you have to cross a freeway on and off ramp. Reconsider if you have kids.

Out of the many hotels we have stayed at the Ménage is the best so far, and if the prices stay reasonable will probably stay that way as we will continue to use it rather than try somewhere else. Best feature, besides it being within easy walking distance from Disney thus allowing afternoon snooze/swim; the restaurant is great and right on the doorstep. The rooms are very nice, of a good size and clean, the main attributes we look far as well as ‘value for money’.

All our guest rooms are designated non-smoking, and we have always taken great care and pride in the cleanliness of our rooms. If you had brought your discomfort with your accommodations to the attention of our staff, I am positive they would have made things right for you. It is very difficult to solve a problem if a guest says nothing of their dissatisfaction.  I would encourage any traveler to say something if they are unhappy with their room, in any hotel.   The shuttle service to Disneyland is not owned or operated by Hotel Menage. We have no say in the fares they charge, or the timing of their schedule, and we don't believe that opinions of an unrelated business should be reflected in the review of Hotel Menage. We do, however, appreciate your tips and comments; it must be frustrating to wait for a shuttle for 45 minutes when the walking distance is only 10 minutes!   Regarding the mention of a taxi deposit of $11 - we do not charge a deposit for booking a taxi. Shuttle services to the airport require a deposit, but there is no hotel required surcharge for booking any type of transportation. I would appreciate if you could contact me directly to let me know who was trying to charge a deposit for a taxi; this is against hotel policy, and it would be helpful to know who said this to you.

You are right, Hotel Menage is not an Embassy Suites, and we do not claim to be.

Regarding the walk to Disneyland from our hotel, I would like to clarify for readers: it is a 1/2 mile walk (approx 10-15 minutes with children) on a pedestrian ramp over the freeway. It is in no way dangerous with or without children, and there has never been any danger in walking to Disneyland. The Disney shuttle bus is not associated with Hotel Menage, they simply offer a stop at our front door; a round-trip day pass is $4 per person.

I had to cover my 16 yr old eyes because these girls had no self respect showing nimples and all.   Parking was HELL.. pay the extra 2 bucks its sooo much easier.

The rooms were very comfortable and felt clean. The business center is very chic and convenient (they let you print for free).

The $50 per night authorization is for any possible incidentals, including, but not limited to: room service, parking charges, restaurant charges, in-room movies, telephone use, etc. If you charge nothing to your room, the authorization is voided and returned to your credit card.

Having the advantage of being close to Disneyland comes with the convenience (or disadvantage - depending on perspective) of being near the I-5 freeway. In an effort to eliminate surprises, we have made sure that our location is clearly shown on all of the maps associated with our web advertising and points of booking. With this map feature, a person can see our physical location prior to booking their reservations.    Regarding parking fees, I can assure you that it is not uncommon for hotels in the Anaheim area to charge for parking. Our parking fee of $10 (self parking) or $12 (valet parking) is clearly stated on all our points of booking, and is the same cost or lower than all other hotels in the area.   It is also very common in Anaheim, for hotels in the same price-range as ours, to have outdoor corridors. We do our best to keep our corridors clean, open, and well-lit for our guest's safety and convenience. Since your review, we have spoken with our room service and housekeeping staff about keeping all corridors clear of room service trays - a tray in the hallway for an extended amount of time is unacceptable, and we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

However, the rooms still look like a renovated motel room as you had to access the rooms from the outside and the air conditioner was like the ones you found at a Quality Inn. The beds were comfortable, but pretty small (didn't look like a queen). I found that the carpet and wall color did not match at all.

The rooms do need a little TLC (our toilet rocked, and the tub leaked), but it was clean and comfortable.  We had booked a room overlooking the pool, but the WIFI didn't work in our room, so after trying 5 different rooms, my husband found one...that overlooked the kitchen roof. Yeah. But the hotel staff made it right by giving us coupons for a free adult meal everytime we went up to the counter for the ""kids eat free"" coupons.  The restaurant food was excellent, and the staff was great. I will definitely recommend this hotel, and we would defnitely stay there again.

We arrived at 2PM an hour before scheduled check in and only had to wait a few minutes to get a room.  As priority club members we were given a reserved parking space right by the front door.  We received $10 off breakfast every day, and of course all meals for the kids were free.   We ate several meals in the restaurant, Poppy's.  The food was always excellent and most of the time the service was VERY fast.  The only time it was slow was on our last day when we slept late and went to breakfast after 9:30.  They were very crowded and slow then.  The shuttle was great.  $2 per person daily gave you unlimited rides, and dropped you right in front of the",July 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2278,24
