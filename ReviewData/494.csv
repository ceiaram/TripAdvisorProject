none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disgusting.,"First of all, we had no communication from the management when I requested 2 adjoining or nearby rooms. I emailed a couple of different times to check on that request, heard nothing. Dirty, grimy baseboards and walls. Doors were covered in dirty handprints. Even though it was December, there were BUGS in our room. I can only imagine what it would be like in the summer.... ick. The bathtubs were barely held together with cracking caulk. The TP was one-ply. The wi-fi passwords ""expire"" in 2 days, and would only allow 2 devices per password. The old TVs had poor reception. We were never left with enough towels, even though the rooms CLEARLY were meant for 4 people (2 double beds). Overall, it was a dump and we will never return.

There was blood on the wall and when we pulled the blankets back on the bed it looked like a murder scene. There was blood all over the side of the bed. We immediately asked for our money back. The front desk was nice enough to give us back our money since we booked this through a non refund app. I would not let anyone stay here ever. Not a good area of town either.

I would stay there again.",March 2015,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,494

Lo abbiamo scelto per il prezzo che era molto conveniente. Da huntington beach dista tra i 20 e i 40 minuti in macchina in base al traffico che si trova. Non è proprio vicino ma per i prezzi che ti propongo in quella zona ad orange county facendoti un calcolo tra la benzina che si spende ad andare tutti i giorni ad huntignton più le spese dell'hotel risparmi comunque parecchio. Il proprietario del motel è un indiano molto disponibile e simpatico. A noi ha fatto allogiare in una camera da 2 persone anche se eravamo in 4. Le camere sono molto pulite e con letti comodi. Quindi per chi non cerca una sistemazione di lusso nei,August 2012,none,Traveled with friends,none,2.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,494
