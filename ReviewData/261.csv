I’m a diamond member with Hilton, tried them first and had a poor experience with one of the staff at a Hampton Inn. So I decided to try this Marriott because it was getting late. I came in late my first night, Justin was very kind and got me in my room right away. I ended extending my stay a few times because the accommodations and service were just what I needed.

Jason Robinson, the Property Sales Manager at the Anaheim Hills Residence Inn,  was a great help in finding the best room reservations possible for this large group.  The rooms were great for the family; clean and spacious with a kitchen and living area.   The family really enjoyed the pool and breakfast.  They also found the hotel conveniently located to the shopping center and restaurants nearby.   My family said that they would love to stay there again on their next visit.

The internet connection kept dropping. we paid for the upgraded internet and it did the same thing. We had to call IBAHN to get a refund and I would seriously doubt this will happen as they gave us the runaround. We stayed in a one bedroom and it did NOT have a full kitchen. There was no stove and two small burners.  The walls were paper thing and the floor bounced. When anyone near us had the showers on, it was incredibly loud. When we had our shower on, we could not hear each other speak.  To top it all off, they charge $3 per day for the use of the safe.

We were driving to Vegas and Brian volunteered to look up the road conditions as it was snowing in the mountains and some roads were closed the previous day. He also looked up the address and directions to our hotel in Vegas. The breakfast was excellent. The web access was free and very fast.
