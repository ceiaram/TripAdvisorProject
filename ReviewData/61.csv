The rooms are clean.   The common areas are clean.  The reservation requirement of the pool prevents overcrowding.  Food at the bistro does the job.  Valet is quick.  Sure, walking back from the park in the middle of the day is a drag but after all it’s only a 5-10 minute walk.  The level of service is what you’d expect from a JW Marriott or higher tier hotel.  We stayed at three different hotels on this road trip (another one being a bonvoy autograph property and another a self-proclaimed four star French chain) and this one - a courtyard- surprisingly has the best service!

The convenience of the cafe/bistro and market were helpful after long days at the parks. And the walkability to Disneyland was great!   Some annoyances: several of the electrical outlets wouldn’t hold so I couldn’t plug in our baby monitors or sound machines in several parts of the rooms. And probably the worst are the multiple blinking lights in the bedrooms. Please please find a way to conceal the lights. Very disturbing for light sleepers.

The room was comfortable and the bunkbeds were nice but it is very overpriced. We paid on a sliding scale for the 5 days we were there with the minimum being $401.00 per night and the max being $598.00 this is in no way a $600 per night hotel.

I booked a month out and go the times that I wanted, but not happy that I had to do it.  - I recall the mattresses being more comfortable at my last visit four years ago.

Thank you so much for writing such a thorough review. Your review will be a big help to other travelers so they can determine whether we are the right hotel for their travel needs and it helps us know where we have room for improvement. We have heard you and will work on making improvements wherever possible.  Our most important goal is the safety of our guests; small unattended children excited about seeing the Disney parks or fireworks could get into trouble climbing on the balcony railings so we do not have furniture on our balconies. Our waterpark reservation system prevents over-crowding and ensures we do not exceed the fire marshal and health department maximum occupancy limits at our water park and affords all our guests the opportunity to enjoy the waterpark in a safe, clean, and uncrowded environment. Thank you for being our guests and for sharing your insights with us. Sincerely, Bill Cleaver, General Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,346,61

I loved the smell in the lobby. There is a cafe down there and the food is really good and pretty decently priced. The staff was all wonderful and super helpful.   My only complaint is that the water park requires reservations, and it closes for 30-60 minutes between each session. So the longest you can be at the pool is about 2 hours.

We do not automatically provide daily housekeeping service, but we invite our guests to let us know if they prefer no service, limited service, or full service. We are desperately looking forward to returning to pre-covid-19 housekeeping service levels but are currently unable to staff all the positions in the hotel.  When the Disney resort and the Anaheim convention center closed, we were forced to close our hotel for 411 days due to lack of business and had to lay off the entire staff (including me). Once we reopened, we hired and trained as many staff members as we could however occupancy levels fluctuated up and down as the various covid-19 variant waves swept through our area. The instability of the hospitality business, especially in our area, has been an impediment to our ability to attract and keep staff members; many prefer more stable work, such as factory or distribution centers, as those businesses have been a more reliable source of steady employment.  We have been successful in hiring for our front desk, valet, and food service positions but housekeepers continue to be in short supply throughout the Anaheim Resort area. We hope covid-19 is fading and that hotel occupancy levels will stabilize which will help us attract workers so that we can return to daily housekeeping services. Our valet charges are posted on our website so that our guests can make an informed decision about our hotel and our prices are in line with our market.

Sleeping was a bit difficult because the street noise was excessive.  It sounded like race cars on the freeway during the night which woke me up on several occasions.  We appreciated the two queen beds and the bunk beds, but the bathroom layout was awkward.  While there were two sinks, you couldn't use on of them if someone was going to the restroom because they would open the door on you.  Also, the second shower was useless because it was in the main part of the bathroom, so no one could brush their teeth or anything unless if you didn't need any privacy.

I also recommend taking an Uber to get groceries for snacks/breakfast. The little shops nearby the hotel are crazy expensive. I'm talking like $4 for an individual size milk expensive. The hotel itself was great. Our room had two queen beds and a bunk bed set. We also had a bathroom with two showers and a mini fridge. It was very convenient and comfortable.

We also provide this information on our reservation confirmation notices with a link to the waterpark reservation app.  Our Surfside Waterpark reservation policy enables us to deliver on our most important goals: the safety and health of our guests. Our reservation system helps to prevent over-crowding; too many people in the waterpark can lead to injuries and water quality issues. Our reservation policy ensures that we do not exceed the fire marshal and health department maximum occupancy limits at our water park. The scheduled, periodic closures help to ensure that optimum water chemistry is maintained throughout the day - this allows our filtration system, ultraviolet light purification system, and chemical feeders to do their jobs and ensures each session has optimal water quality.

The hotel was amazingly convenient to the park (on prior Disney visits we had longer walks from the parking garages than we did from this hotel).It seemed like such a deal at 1/2 the price of the park resort hotels.

The representations in the photos are accurate, beds were comfortable, extra things most rooms don't have (booth and table and the extra shower) were appreciated. I liked the size of the room, bunk beds, fridge and microwave and our 8 YO daughter loved the pool and water-slide area.

Of special note was besides the two queen beds, there was a bunk bed, which my then 3.5 year old thought was the coolest hotel feature ever.

I apologize for the confusion with your payment. When a guest books a hotel reservation and confirms it with a credit card the hotel will generally just confirm that the credit card offered is a valid credit card and will not charge the card at that time (unless it is an advance payment reservation). When the guest arrives at the hotel the hotel will enter the credit card and reserve funds for the estimated amount of the bill but will still not charge the card. Finally, at checkout the hotel will charge the card for the full amount. I can assure you that you were not over-charged or billed twice for your stay.   The hotel did refund you for your parking fees as a courtesy to you for your troubles. I will e-mail you another copy of your bill and have highlighted the line item on your bill which states: ""Rebate - Parking"" which shows the amount of your refund.   We have no record of any damaged vehicles at our hotel during your stay dates.    Please contact me if you would like a further explanation of our accounting/bill payment or if you would like to further discuss your experience.

I truly regret the inconvenience which our problem caused you and your family.   We do have valet only parking which we fully disclose on our website and all of our travel partners are aware of. We also include this information in our confirmation email to ensure there are no hidden costs for our guest so I am sorry this information was not communicated properly at the time of booking.  Cellular service is provided by various carriers with varying performance levels. Our location near Disneyland poses problems due to the high volume and high density of cellular activity in the area.  Most of our guests switch their cellphones to Wi-Fi calling in order to overcome any cellular service deficiencies. We have a large amount of band width which automatically increases during high demand periods, and we have access points in each room, in each hallway and several throughout the lobby area. We also provide a help desk through our Wireless provider to assist guests who are having trouble connecting their devices to our Wi-Fi system. Guests’ personal devices may have trouble accessing a hotel’s Wi-Fi system based on settings, previous connections, and a host of other technical issues related to the personal devices. It is worth the time to contact a hotels Wi-Fi service provider when experiencing difficulties as the vast majority of connection issues are related to the devices and settings. Many of our internal hotel services rely on our Wi-Fi so we would know if we were having any issues and the system is monitored by our vendor at all times.   Our front desk agent should have assisted you in a courteous manner and facilitated a remedy for you; I sincerely apologize for his “glazed over eyes”. Our housekeeping department cleans rooms anytime between 9am and 5pm; we do our best to balance the competing needs of early arriving guests, late check out guests, guest who want to return mid-day for a nap or to use the pool. We do encourage our guests in our check-in pamphlet to let us know if they require their room to be cleaned by a certain time. I apologize that we did not meet your needs. The front desk staff should have explained that after 5pm we will be happy to provide limited service and informed housekeeping of your requested cleaning time request for future days.   I apologize that our staff was not able to assist in a more timely manner tracking down the computer that was left behind upon your departure and I certainly apologize that UPS was unable to ship the computer as requested.    It is our goal to have all of our guests feel extremely satisfied with their stay, and I truly apologize we fell short of our goal and did not meet your expectations.",none,none,none,none,none,none,926,61

WiFi and Cellphone service are a bit tricky in a hotel situation. The hotel provides the WiFi service and your cellphone service provider delivers your cell phone service. The hotel can't do much about poor cellphone service and in a busy destination near Disneyland you are competing with a lot of people for cellphone signal. We do suggest that you turn ""WiFi Calling"" on when you are in our hotel which will greatly improve your cellphone experience.  We do control the WiFi and provide free WiFi service at 10mbps upload/download speeds for up to 6 devices. Our paid service provides 25mbps upload/download service for up to 10 devices and our lobby WiFi provides 8mbps upload/dowload speeds. We do encourage you to contact the front desk or our WiFi service supoort team if you are having connectivity issues. As with most devices, sometimes powering off then on again will help.   In a hotel environment with lots of other hotels in the area, there are many conflicting WiFi signals as well as various device issues which can impede your service; our teams are trained to help you connect and it is well worth the call to ensure you get great connectivity.

I wasn't totally convinced about staying there only due to its location and walking distance from the parks.  With 2 children ages 5 & 7 I knew that walking wasn't going to cut it for the 3 nights we were going to be there as it's a 20 min or so walk.  I am extremely fussy about where I stay on vacation.

Was very surprised to see this property, and was even more surprised to see that it had a waterpark (for kids).

Second, valet parking only is offered, but your car is in a safe parking structure.  The $20 daily valet charge is much better than Disneyland's parking because you would invariably end up taking a shuttle from the parking lot, as opposed to an easy 10-minute walk.

We truly value your loyalty to Marriott and appreciate the many nights you have stayed with Marriott to earn your Gold status. We do upgrade our elite guests to suites and preferred views whenever possible. Many of our suites and preferred rooms are booked in advance and we do have to honor our Elite guest requests based on status with the highest priority going to our Platinum guests; so it does make it impossible to meet all the requests for those room types. I think a lot of people have the misconception that hotels keep a few of their best rooms in reserve but we allocate those rooms every night; I doubt that we have ever had a vacant Disney view room since we opened! We are now on the ART route (Anaheim Resort Transportation) so you can buy an ART bus ticket to go to or return from the Disney Resort if you are too tired to walk. I hope you made many magical memories with your family while visiting the Disney Resort area!,none,none,none,none,none,none,1161,61

We have researched the events which lead up to your experience and have found out that the housekeeping supervisor and housekeepers both made critical mistakes in preparing your room. The housekeepers cleaned the room but did not do a thorough job. The housekeeping supervisor entered the room, viewed the room, and immediately went to the telephone and entered a code which changed the room status from vacant/dirty to vacant/clean in our property management system. As she was entered the code she noticed that the room was not cleaned properly but received a call to attend to an emergency which was happening in another guest room and left the room before changing the status back to vacant/dirty.   The front desk was unaware of the mistake and saw that the status of the room was vacant/clean and checked you into the room. After clearing the emergency from the other guest room the supervisor went to go back to your room but you had already been checked into the room. The housekeeping supervisor realized her mistake but failed to report the situation to her manager.   I sincerely apologize for our mistakes and assure you that this was an isolated incident and certainly a violation of our standard operating procedures. Proper disciplinary action and additional training has been provided to those involved in this incident and a departmental review meeting has been conducted.

I apologize about our valet parking policy but wanted to explain some of our reasoning. We exclusively offer valet parking for a several reasons: of course we want to make money (I would be remiss if I didn't admit that) but convenience, safety & security are also very important to use. Anaheim is one of the safest resort destinations in the USA and we want to keep it that way. Each car which is left with our valet team is photographed front, back and both sides at valet registration, this process documents each car and license plate (this alone turns away many questionable people). This process also documents the condition of each vehicle at check in. Our valet team ensures that no valuables are left in cars which helps us prevent possible crimes before they happen. Our garage is primarily used only by our staff so we can detect and question people who should not be in the garage. Surprisingly, SUV's with 3rd row seats are a major target for criminals throughout the USA, since we control our garage when we park SUV's we back them up against concrete walls which prevent the 3rd row seats from being stolen out of the tailgates. Our valet policy is intended to help protect our guests from having anything negative happen to them while staying with us. One additional note, we only have one bank of guest elevators but there are two elevators in that bank and they both travel from from the 1st to top floor. Sorry for the long-winded answer but I wanted to provide you with our thought process behind our policy. Please let me know if I can be of additional service to you or answer any additional questions. Have a happy new year!",none,none,none,none,none,none,1398,61

5 helpful votes,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great place for families,We stumbled on this hotel after searching several days of sold out options. We were taking a family trip to Disneyland and needed something within close walking distance. Four adults and four children including grandmother over 80 and a 3 year old and 6 week old.   This place was great! It's very close to the main gates and restaurants. It's a new hotel so everything was clean and in good shape.  Upon arriving the valet was very professional and polite helping unload our cars. Check in was a breeze. We were on the sixth floor which offered great views and unlike other hotels we did not hear hallway noise or noise from surrounding rooms. We got a room with bunk beds and two queens which worked out perfectly. The beds were comfy and provided with plenty of pillows and blankets.,November 2015,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1420,61

Our stay at the hotel was fantastic from the moment we arrived until the day we left. The service of the staff went above and beyond our expectations. We arrived early from the airport and the hotel allowed us to check in hours earlier. This was great as I had originally assumed they would only have us store our bags and we would have to come back at check in time. Instead, we checked in an were able to relax and frolic in the waterpark while the most families were at Disneyland. On the day we left, our flight was in the evening and we were able to check out in the late afternoon and enjoy the pool some more.

I sincerely apologize that your room was not available for an early check-in when you arrived at 11:30am; the front desk agent should have notified me that you had arrived and were not feeling well so that I could ensure that you received a room as soon as possible. I encourage all our guests to check-in using the Marriott Mobile Application; you are able to check-in prior to arriving at the hotel and you receive instant updates when your room is available. I am happy that you enjoyed the view of the fireworks and waterpark from your room and that your son enjoyed the bunk beds. Our room prices are dynamic and change based on special events as well as overall demand; rates which are available on one day are not necessarily available on the next day.

Whoever designed a bunk bed room for up to 4 kids with NO DOOR on the room that is directly across from the bathroom made a huge mistake. It made it very difficult for us to move about the suite while our kids were asleep at night or in the early morning because they could hear our every move (from the two doorways in to the room with no actual doors) and/or light would enter their room from the bathroom and living space.
