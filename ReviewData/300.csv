none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Out-dated,Very outdated rooms. Not the cleanest hotel but we came prepared with our lysol wipes to clean things down ourselves. Room was very noisy. You could hear the person walking upstirs. No hot water if waking around 8 am. I had to wake up earlier to use hot water. Nails were sticking up from the floor trim in the bathroom. We had to cover it with Band-aids to protect our family. Grab and Go breakfast was not readily available but sign say you can get certain items on the go. I asked for a bottle of water and told I had to be a member. We stayed 6 nights and was never there except to sleep. Also wanted to note how dirty the pool and jacuzzi was.

After reading all the reviews I was hesitant to stay here worried about the place being dirty and full of homeless people but that is the case. I've stayed at a lot of hotels and during my National Parks trip through Nevada, Utah, and Colorado I've stayed at a lot of Best Western Plus since they're the closest to the National Park entrances.

Drawbacks: Sink is outside of the bathroom area - since we were staying with our adult daughter, it was difficult to bring in all of our toiletries/clothing into the bathroom to get ready without a place to put it all, small space to work in and the fan wasn't powerful enough to pull all the steam out so it wasn't the most pleasurable experience with that process (even with the little window open).

There is a ridiculous walkway behind the rooms which was super concerning. The sliding door had a good lock but the bathroom window which would fit a human had a really flimsy lock. Both windows lacked sealing so the air was cold. Because of those back windows on a walkway as well as the front -there was no natural light as we kept the  blinds closed.

Hotel management has an obligation to inform guests of any construction in progress, otherwise they are misleading guests while withholding information until it is too late to cancel your reservation without paying for some portion of the reservation. In addition, with the large rooms, the hotel appeared popular with large groups / families; resulting in overcrowding the undersized pool (safety may be an issue here since there was apparently no lifeguard on duty).

Some way over priced. We made two trips to the BWP Irvine Spectrum. The last trip was a bust on a deal in San Diego but the hotel was soooo nice to come to and call it a day. The desk people are always very nice and super accommodating. My room is always quiet and very comfortable. Breakfast staff people were so nice and friendly, the food was very good and the waffles are a treat. If you like simple and plain, this is the ticket. For a small breakfast room, the variety is very nice. This is a great home away from home for my business trips. No complaints at all but wonder about the bowl sink on top of the dresser near the TV.

Our stay was five nights, departing Christmas Day.  Our 4th floor rooms were spacious and clean.  The living area contained a large 16x9 aspect ratio TV, comfortable couch and matching easy chair, an office desk, ample storage drawers, a fridge and microwave.  The totally separate bedroom and bath had a similar TV and a comfortable king size foam mattress.  Again, plenty of storage for an extended stay.  Nice bath, good towels, and an adjustable shower head that actually worked.    A big plus in my mind was the lighting.  The minute we turned on the lights I thought they were 100 watt incandescents.  I am really put off by dark rooms, poorly lit by 13 watt cfls that",December 2013,none,none,"Thank you for your feedback on your recent visit to our property.

none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great value and location,This hotel was conveniently located close to the freeway and getting on and off was easy. There are several good chain restaurants very close to the hotel and they offer a great range in both price and quality.  This is an excellent location if you want to be near downtown Seattle but want to avoid costly hotel parking and downtown hotel prices.,December 2013,none,none,"We always appreciate any feedback from our guests.
