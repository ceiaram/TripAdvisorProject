On arrival hotel looked ok at reception, up to the room it was so dark, brown and blue carpet, dark furniture, dark beige on the walls,  these room need to be a bit brighter and move away from carpets in them very unhygienic.   Bathroom was clean but no walk in shower, shower over a bath not suitable for people that can’t easily get in and out a bath.  The room lighting was so poor despite ample lighting outlets, just a change of bulb colour would have made a space more welcoming, they had a microwave and a fridge that was good, also had  two TVs in the room, one in the bed area and one in the seating area.

I checked about six other reviews for other hotels and I noted a common theme of unclean. That was not the case at Ayers. These folks have their act together.  The attention to detail in design is spot on.  Having a small frig in the room and the Microwave is perfect for anyone staying for a few days on, etc.   We worked for extended hours at the work table (two of us at the ends... they got us another chair) and the comfort and chairs never left us unhappy.

I called the hotel to find out when the restaurant stopped serving dinner, the front desk person said the last order would go in at 9:30, the restaurant closes at 10:00.  I raced back to the hotel, and was in the door at 9:19.  I could see the chef cleaning the grill in the kitchen, and another man told me they were closed.

It's always special to me, as I grew up on the Orange County beaches...but some time ago, I abandoned the beaches when it came to hotels. ""Why?"" you might ask. Well, I'll tell you. So many of the beach hotels have become tired and worn out, and far too pricey for what they offer.   Also, there's a secret that only a guy like me who grew up on the Orange County beaches can tell you: if you want sun in abundance, it won't happen at the beach.

I stumbled upon this place through an online hotel discount site (the type where you don't find out where you're staying until you pay) and lucked out.  The drive is not real far (by L.A. standards).  You can get to most Orange County attractions and shopping between 15-30 minutes of driving.  There's a few good restaurants, a supermarket and a Walgreens just minutes away.  (Tip: A couple of nice cafes to check out nearby are Coffee, Tea and Tulips and Break of Dawn.)  The hotel is fairly new.  As such, the rooms were modern-looking with a sofabed, two large TVs, and a comfy king sized bed.
