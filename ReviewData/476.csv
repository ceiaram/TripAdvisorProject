I walked in and literally had tears in my eyes because of how disgusting the place was. Cockroaches everywhere! Needle caps under the bed and in the bathroom. A nasty high heel under the bed. I couldn't stop itching. I couldn't shower because it was backed up and kept filling up with dirty nasty water. I called the manager and they hung up on me.",August 2017,none,Traveled solo,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,476
none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Looking for a clean reasoniable priced place to sleep,"Just down the street from Knotts Berry Farm, seconds from the I 5 freeway, 3 minutes from  CA 91 freeway.  The Coral Motel is older quaint motel the walls are sound proof my room was large had a small refrigerator and tile floor, which was great for my shedding Belgain Shepard.  Hotels start at about $70 and go up quick, weekends at the Coral Motel $50 a day.  The Coral is a friendly family run business, unfortunately I speak only english and there is a language barrier and communication takes time,  I dont know if there is a pool, there is laundry room and no problem getting on the free internet (you dont get that at motel 6).  I am going back Buena Park in a few days, you can find me at the Coral Motel every time.",December 2014,They are remodeling and upgrading the rooms so stop look and listen.
