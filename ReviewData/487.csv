Having driven 10 hours on scenic routes of west cost, we arrived to collect keys late evening. They were in an obscure safe box in a difficult spot in the basement parking. This is a huge complex and each building has several entrances. There was no real help available to guide us! Written instructions were fairly useless. Finally a very kind local resident started helping us and after much searching and using his access fob to. Aeolus areas we manger to locate the safe box. If it weren't for his help, there was little hope we find it at all! Then when we entered the apartment to realize there is a very bad smell from previous tenants smoking cigarettes and other types of cigarettes!! I have allergy to smell of tobacco!

No way!,"My whole family stayed there for more than two weeks recently, but we couldn't find anyone at the facility to handle any request. Only by emails or phone calls. No one showed up at all during the stay.  But as long they provided seamless service, it's OK. But from making reservations, requesting booking modifications etc it took at least three days even a minor changes or request like change of names and the like.  As I am not in the states, I tried to call their customer service one day, and the lady who got the call kept asking me in a very offended manner if that call was emergency, otherwise I had to call their business hours, which I don't have no clue if it's pacific time or EST.  I don't know if this is company policy, but they are very active when checking",July 2017,none,Traveled with family,"Thank you for your honest feedback. Your experience is extremely important to us.

7 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Poor staff service,"The lady in charge of the rental, Ann Zirpoli, is un-cooperating, cold hearted and indifferent to customers concerns. First, we asked for an early check-in as the 4:00 PM check-in time is too late for our early arrival in the morning in Los Angeles. She adamantly refused to accommodate us and asked for a $50.00 extra fee. Then, after we asked to speak to her supervisor, she accepted a 2:00PM early check-in after a series of email exchanges. Also, 2 or 3 days before our arrival date, we asked for the move-in instructions which she refused to provided giving as an excuse than her computer was not available and that she had to check whether we had paid up before sending these instructions. The result was we were left without the printout of the move-in instructions when we departed",January 2017,none,Traveled as a couple,"We sincerely apologize that you had that type of experience.
