We recently received a new confirmation dated 1/8/18 in the mail with an increase of approximately $17 per night per room. I was told that the rate I was originally quoted was under quoted from a now apparent ex-manager and the new confirmation rate reflects an acceptable rate for the Inn.

Room was cleaned and we had coffee and continental breakfast. Bathroom was cleaned and there is Hot and Cold water 24/hrs. Wireless Internet was fast and smooth. Watch the beach from your bed and surf the web at the same time. Gorgeous view and nice clean motel. We will come here often and stay here since we have noticed, "" the motel is well protected by cc cameras at the parking lot as well as at the lobbies.""",February 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,202,201

The bed was rock hard, the mattress had a plastic sheet for a mattress pad and the sheet barely fit and came off during the night.  We could not get hot water in the shower, just lukewarm, and the towels smelled weird and not fresh.  The parking spaces were extremely small.  The relative who made our reservation could not get thru to the motel by phone and had to make our reservation in person.  We felt unsafe - door from lobby to parking garage was open.  And we couldn't complain because we had to pay in advance and leave our keys in the room in the morning.  If there was coffee or breakfast, they didn't tell us about it!   Maybe some of this was because it was off season, but we will not stay there again.  Only good thing was",January 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,203,201
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beenu,"Sanatra Inn, a perfect and a beautiful experience to have stayed there.  Anyone who mentions it horrible need to change their views because there could be no place as pleasant as Sanatra Inn. The staff is polite, soft spoken and co-operative, the service is quick and the continental breakfast offered is too good. Standing in the balcony and having a view outside makes one feel leisured and homely. The rooms are clean and so are the linens and carpets. The flooring of the motel is good and the interiors as well. And what else could one wish than having a reliable free wireless T1 internet facility which is available everywhere in the motel.      Infact we were hesitating to take a chance since someone had mentioned horrible, but after having stayed there, if anyone asks me where",October 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,204,201

Sanatrainn Provided beautiful room to us and with clean and neat balcony facing the ocean. TV was big and working in cable mode. Bed was comfortable and capet was new. There we had wi-fi internet reliable connection everywhere in the motel. The lobby was cleaned and the staff was polite. Although Sanatrainn is exactly on PCH we never felt noice. In the morning we had coffee and a cool walk at the green belt. The parking lot was cleaned and under the cover of CC cameras. I will definately recommend this motel to everyone and stay here often when visitng SoCal.,September 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,205,201
3 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It All Depends, Doesn't It?","Motels are just like life:  It all depends upon what you want to get out of it, and what you bring to it.  Let me say right up front for those of you in a hurry:  We will DEFINITELY stay at the Sanatra Inn again.  But that said......  THE BAD NEWS The Sanatra Inn on the outside looks like something you might find in Baghdad or some other war-torn third world country.  Here in the USofA we euphemistically refer to it as ""deferred maintenance.""  WOW!  I haven't ever seen a motel like this on the California coast in my adult life.  In Iraq or The Sudan, it might well be the best one in town.  Lots of rusting hardware, hinges, dilapidated entry doors; an empty pool with bizarre personal belongings, toys, and junk around it.

The carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned in 10 years.  Common areas are dirty, run down and decrepit.  This used to be a neat little place, about 10 or 12 years ago.
