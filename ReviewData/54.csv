The hotel is across the street from Knott's Berry Farm, on the corner of Beach Blvd and Cresent Ave so there is no escaping street noise or park noise.

Furniture and molding had numerous nicks and divots in them.  The door was loose in its frame which did not help to keep the noise level down.

My son had spilled the white wine they give you when you arrive on the floor and it broke, I was cleaning it up and was so disgusted on how filthy the carpet was.  I know floors in hotels are bad but I could not believe how many times I rang out the towel and always was black, so gross.  Our friends said this was the worst hotel they ever stayed in.

The route takes the driver around all of the parks, and there's no way to tell what traffic or other incidents may prevent him from showing up on time. So, all we can ask for is your patience.  However, the fact that the carpets were so dirty is very concerning. The room should have been spotless as soon as you walked in, and I apologize that this wasn't the case. We care a lot about our guests, and we'd love it if you gave us another chance the next time you're in the area. I'm sure you won't be disappointed!

I didn't even get that far because of their inability to provide customer service.   I made my reservation over the phone because that is how I could get the best rate they offered. The reservations agent confirmed my reservation for January 17th and took my credit card number to secure the room. I asked for a confirmation email and received nothing. I suppose I was too trusting that this hotel knew how to do something as simple as put a reservation in the computer, but I was fooled. I called back when I noticed a charge on my credit card and the hotel said that there was no record of my January 17th reservation but on record was a DECEMBER 17th reservation. I have never dealt with a hotel representative",December 2014,none,none,"Of course, I'm disappointed to see your review, Sarah. Unfortunately, because your original reservation was a no show you were charged the first night as this is a long standing policy across the industry. Although our reservationists are trained to repeat the details prior to confirming reservation possibilty of error lurks on both sides.   That being said, if a customer has to be charged, we give our guests a full credit for a future stay that is good for up to one year. So I hope you'll consider coming back to stay with us, because we strive very hard to please every guest that enter our door.

When we arrived, Ricardo greeted us with a friendly welcome. Check-in took a long time. It wasn't Ricardo's fault, just the system they use. They had to go through each room (all 6) individually, run my credit card (they actually charge a $50 room deposit, not just a ""hold"") and scan my drivers license for each room.

I usually stay at the Motel 6 chain of motels they no longer honor the AARP card for discounts. Would like to see Best Host Inn give discounts to quests who are over 55 years of age or older or honor the AARP Card !  One more suggestion would like to make local calls from the rooms.,July 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,954,54
