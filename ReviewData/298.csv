Das Hotel liegt direkt an einer mehrspurigen Hauptstraße, aber vom Verkehr hört man bei geschlossenem Fenster gar nichts. Parkplätze sind ausreichend vorhanden.  Die Dame am Empfang war sehr freundlich, und das einchecken verlief sehr zügig. Unser Zimmer war im ersten Stock und es war sehr sauber. Die vorhanden Geräte wie z. B. der Fernseher, die Klimaanlage, oder der Fön funktionierten einwandfrei. Das Zimmer schien auch erst vor kurzem neu eingerichtet worden zu sein. Es gibt neben einer Kaffeemaschine auch eine Mikrowelle und einen Kühlschrank. Im Zimmer gab es für mich nur einen Minuspunkt, und zwar lies sich das Fenster nicht öffnen. Es gibt zwar eine Klimaanlage, aber man will ja doch ab und zu mal",November 2022,none,Traveled as a couple,"Sehr geehrter Herr Friese1984,   vielen Dank, dass Sie uns Ihre Eindrücke von Ihrem letzten Aufenthalt in unserem Holiday Inn Express Anaheim West mitteilen.

The good is the beds were comfortable. The breakfast wasn’t bad. Electricity went out during breakfast but luckily we were packed and ready to go. No one at front desk to check out and a line of customers so we left and will never be back.",October 2022,none,Traveled with family,"Hi DebbieH530,  Thank you for leaving us feedback surrounding your experience with the Holiday Inn Express Anaheim West.

I didn't let that bother me. I'm glad the police are doing their job. But, the room wasn't very clean. The carpet was filthy and sticky. There were zero towels. When I checked in, someone was calling from their room for towels. Apparently all services are ""on-demand only"".  And the place was pretty noisy. I tolerate noise pretty well but this place was pretty noisy.",October 2022,none,Traveled on business,"Dear C2H5OHFresno_CA,   I appreciate you for sharing your review about your recent stay.

I booked two rooms for a family reunion. One of the few hotels in the area that offer Queen sized beds. The beds were comfy and pillows fully. The sheets and towels however were stiff. They also limited the towels to adults, did not include children in the room. We were always having to request more towels. They never collected the trash. We took it out ourselves. One room which my adult sons were staying in, had a broken lock on the door. The door was fixed the very next day. The toilet paper holder fell right off the wall. All bathrooms could use new flooring, its cracked. And bath could use new caulking. This hotel is a good 15 minute drive to Disneyland.

We waited but nobody showed up. I went back downstairs and he was the only employee here, he had three people checking in. After we booked online with I HG, they added $15 for parking. I asked for another room. This rooms sink only had hot water.  Oh, and the sink didn’t drain. There is no breakfast and  attendant said the TVs don’t work. That’s it so far.",July 2020,none,Traveled as a couple,"Hello babymarge,  I thank you for your stay and for writing about your experience. It's a pleasure hearing from one of our valued guests.
