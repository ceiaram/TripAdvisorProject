The location is great for my meetings and until this visit I loved the accommodating staff. The rooms have a mildew odor but when I can stay on a discount, it works. This is the first time I’ve met Whitney, the smiling Witch. She was calling my room “before I got in the room” I heard the phone ringing as I was opening the door. She was telling me my discount expired last week and my rate went up by $90!! I told her she got to be kidding! I had to rebook a room at another rate on my own (+$60) or pay standard rate.

The supervisor who assisted you, did attempt to allow you to gain access to a discounted rate by allowing you time to have the appropriate forms resent.

We do everything we can to satisfy our guests cost efficiency needs, through various point promotions and rate deals we run through the year.

Providing the highest level of hospitality is our number one priority and we sincerely apologize for falling short of meeting your expectations. As a teachable moment, we have shared your feedback with the appropriate hotel team to ensure the necessary guidelines are in place to prevent inconsistent Air-conditioning function from occurring in the future. In fact, we are 80% complete on the vast project of converting the property to central AC. Very soon, guest room temperature will become extremely precise. While consistent air flow will be introduced to all rooms, central units in the celling will provide powerful thermostat controls to each individual guest room. While our individual units in rooms are less than 2 years, we do understand that a new inverter central system will greatly improve the ability to cool or warm a room faster and more consistently.   It is a little concerning that you reported the water pressure to be much more powerful in your room on the fist floor than that in your parents room on the third floor. Anaheim hills is actually known for their water pressure and a recent test at the property confirmed a PSI reading that was on the higher side for commercial properties. In any event, we did pass your information onto the Engineering immediately as it was reported.   Thank you so much for your kind comments o our housekeeping and breakfast teams.

He finally agreed to reduce my first nights rate by $15.00 but overcharged me the second night by $21.00. He therefore lied about his ability to change the rate to my original confirmation.

So now I have to waste more time if I want to get",April 2018,none,none,"Hello Sir,  I apologize we were unable to resolve this matter at the time you came to check in at 4:26 pm. As I explicitly outlined at the time, we simply can't keep rooms vacant for guests if they do not present themselves at the hotel to check in on the day of arrival. As you are aware, you arrived the property the day after your reservation had passed. Unfortunately, we received no information that you would request to move the reservation one day ahead (which may or may not have been honored due to availability). Therefore, the reservation was determined to be a ""no show"" reservation. As there was no attempt to communicate with the property, it unfortunately falls outside of the cancellation window. I want to assure you that no one at the hotel cancelled your reservation, by choosing not to check into your reservation on the day that was booked caused your reservation to be voided as a no show, which is a standard hotel procedure.   Upon arrival, the desk agent who assisted you looked up your last name only to discover that the reservation had passed and was listed as a no show. At the time the agent announced, she “assumed” it would be a new reservation for tonight. Following this, a comment was passed in regards to the validity of assumptions. As a result of this, the GM was called to personally assist.     At Fairfield Inn, we are always willing to offer competitive rates, however, the specific room and rates that you originally booked was no longer available the following day. Although the rate was slightly different for your new stay, as a courtesy to you, we chose to reduce the rate of your first night to match that of the original booking. We really hoped you had provided us with unforeseen circumstances that prevented you from checking into your ""no show"" reservation, however, the issue you presented to us was quite the opposite. We did of course acknowledge the original confirmation you revealed, however, once the day has passed and the reservation has been missed, the confirmation number and rates generated within are no longer valid. We had no indication that you would be coming back to the property the following day because there was no new reservation. That is why our front desk agent booked a reservation for you.  We do sincerely apologize that this caused quite the hassle at the front desk and we truly understand that after a long day the last thing that anyone could want is to encounter issues upon check in. We hope that you will maintain your affection for our property and thank you again for being a loyal Marriott guest.",none,none,none,none,none,none,45,169

A bit over-priced for what you get, I thought.  The outside of the buildings are typical multi-story road-side motel, but cleaner.

I needed an early check-in (as I have before- if you have read some of my other reviews) as was very well accomodated. Lucky for me, Diane, the General Manager was assisting at the front desk. Evelyn, the front desk agent, originally told me there were no rooms with king beds available. Diane stepped in and found three rooms that had them. Thanks, Diane! :) Evelyn showed me a map and asked if my room would be ok. Not knowing any better (and happy they let me check in early) I said ok. It wasn't until 4am when I found out why she asked if",October 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,325,169

They put us on the bottom floor right where they were working when the hotel didnt seem to be very full at all. As we were leaving out room a maintenance man began pressure washing our door and mud sprayed through the cracks of the door and got us and our room all dirty. We complained to the front desk and to my surprise they comped our room for the night (which was one of the best things about staying in this hotel).  My other complaints about our room: -the bathroom ""door"" was a sliding door which was heavy, noisy, and awkward to close -lacked a lot of the television channels I watch regularily (eg, comedy central) -""blackout"" curtains",May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,327,169

An elderly couple was ahead of me and tried to get early checkin too and had to wait 30 minutes. No mention of Priceline. Parking lot was empty at 2pm. I was assigned a third floor room, facing the 91 Artesia Freeway and your could hear the noise through the cracks of the door, bring your soft ear plugs. They need to put more weather striping so the noise does not get into the room. This place is definately a two star as the room was motel like, thin walls and cheap used, scuffed up furniture. There was a fridge in the room, but it turned the quart of milk I bought into an icee. The exterior lights on the main building were out during darkness. I heard the neighbor slam the door and yell into the parking lot, so yes, this is a two star",April 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,329,169
8 helpful votes,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Pleasant Stay ...,"Check-in was a breeze. When I saw it on the map I was a bit concerned since it was pretty close to the highway but our room faced the parking lot on the inside and I didn't get any noise. Even otherwise it was fairly quiet. The room was good but the main light wasn't working. I didn't care for it much anyways since there were 3 other lights and I basically used the room to crash for the night. The other issue was the lack of dark drapes which caused a lack of privacy in the room and left the room lit at night.  The bathroom door was a ""slider"" which I didn't like very much. And it had no easy-to-grab handles making it difficult to use. The mini-fridge was in the bathroom which seemed like a weird place to put it.

We had a small issue with a bathroom door, and maintenance was sent immediately and solved the problem.  Pool looked clean and lovely, although I didn't use it.

16 helpful votes,9 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,No problems at the Fairfield Inn,"Stayed at the Fairfield Inn Anaheim Hills for 2 nights early Aug2005. After reading some of the previous reviews I was getting nervous. I'm wondering if the people who had their room given away has guaranteed (with a credit card) reservations. PROS:   Room was ready when we got in. Free internet access. Room reasonably clean  Room VERY quiet. (Couldn't hear the 90 / 91 even though very close.) Breakfast was more than adequate ( cereal, french toast, bagels, cream cheese, hard boiled eggs, coffee, tea, apples, bananas.) CONS:  some of the furniture and carpet was stained which turns me off. Paid AAA rate of $72/night for 2 beds which seemed a fair deal to me because this is a pretty nice area.

Our confirmation was for the night we showed up.  They said there was no room.  They directed us to another one of their affilates 15 minutes away and $20.00 more per night.  UNACCEPTABLE! Yes we had to accept it because there was not another room to be had in the area.  Since they were filled up they really didn't care about us or our situation.  In fact they said that if we didn't take the other location within 15 minutes it would no longer be available.

The room was small but the bathroom was big which was nice. At night we could hear the freeway and the toilet running as well as banging on the wall. What that was I do not know! My sister had people next to her partying it up playing techno music and the next day we moved to another room closer to my parents and sister. They gave us the key to the room which was the room of the partiers. It was messy, the beds were unmade, there was jug of alcohol, and a overwhelming smell of smoke. We called the desk who said they would move us. It took them nearly half an hour to give us a new key. The staff is rude and the hotel although nice looking on the outside, is deceiving.

We passed by the Fairfield Inn on the way to the church and it was conveniently located between the church and the country club. Right at the junction of the 90 and 91 in Anaheim, CA. We paid $70 plus taxes. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and decently appointed. It was better than we were expecting for a $70 two star hotel. However, it is a Marriott licensee so their standards are probably higher than mom-and-pop 2 star hotels. Slight detractors were as follows: The bathroom door was a sliding door. Their was a tiny refrigerator located under the bathroom sink. The refrigerator makes noise so we unplugged ours for the night.
