She replaced a worn out DVD player,  gave us extra beach towels to cover wet, out door chairs, helped reset a TV, lent us an umbrella and was basically available if we needed anything. The place itself had a Hispanic hacienda feel and was clean and tidy. They have a media room which we enjoyed for our New Year's Eve party and Game Nights. There's several movies available on site and books, puzzles and cards. There is no pool or exercise room here if you're wanting that but the beach is just across the way and we enjoyed walking on that every morning.

I also read all the rules before I came as much as I could to know what were the requirements expected of me while I was there. ADULTS ONLY.... I did see that. 2 people to a room only.  I found my stay  quiet calm and just my style. The rooms were clean well supply of things needed in the kitchen and bathroom.  Great surrounding and lots to see and do during my stay there. Mindy was polite and friendly to me and my friend when we arrived.  My friend got sick and had to leave early. Mindy did come and check to see if we were OK.

My wife brought in a tiny table and two patio chairs from outside. There was no office, no check-in, no deposit. Just enter the 6-digit passcode and you are in. We discovered that our small assigned parking space was not in front of our unit (#4), after the manager left a note threating towing on our windshield. Other guests received parking passes, but not us. Very nice beachy, California neighborhood. Nice lounge with lots of stuff, including desktop computer and printer so we could print our boarding passes. We spent the week sightseeing and put a lot of miles on the LA freeways. ""Resort"" was next door to a nice little locals bar, J. Neptunes, and a block from another, the Schooner Pub. Both",June 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,40,437

Beso Del Sol is located directly on the Pacific Coast Highway south of Seal Beach between Long Beach and Huntington Beach. A typical little beach town with its own Post Office and city government and area surfers. We really like this type setting but some tourists do not. There are 10 small studios with kichenettes & bathrooms at this little resort. There is no swimming pool but it is a very easy walk to the beach right behind them. There is a hot tub and firepit in the patio area. We requested studio #10 for the quieter side & fartherest from PCH.  Studio #1 would be away from PCH but oncoming traffic would be on that side. Parking spaces are small, not made for vans or large size sedans. Studios are",September 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,41,437

Let me say the location with respect to the beach and neighboring towns is excellent. When we arrived in the afternoon we were able to get in the room right away. There is no a /c in unit 9 and the room had a very strong Lysol odor - like it had recently been cleaned. Once we turned on the overhead fan and opened the windows it aired out pretty quickly. The problem is - it also let all the noise in! Even tho our unit wasn't directly on the PCH it was still very noisy as there is a bar directly across the alleyway. But, overall we were pretty happy with the room. We had a comfy queen sized bed,  a microwave and tiny fridge a 2 burner stove top and a toaster oven. The unit was well equipped with cooking utensils and dishes.",April 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,42,437

The Beach towns just a short distance and lots going on if that's what you are looking for.  Very clean and the bed was marvelous; rested very well at night.  It's right on Pacific Coast Highway, but we never heard much after 10pm.  Staff was extremely helpful.  It is older and it is small-not many places to store things.    We put our empty suitcases back in the car trunk.....worked great.  Would like to have had a comfy chair to sit in to watch TV.",April 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,43,437

Unit has a seperate partial kitchen with french doors to the courtyard.  Parking is limited and tight, small car is recommended.  Complimentary midweek towel exchange, was nice as towels do not dry.  A hot tub and gas fire pit in the back courtyard along with a grill and lounge chairs.  TLC could be used in this area but sure the weather plays a part on the up keep.  Beso Del Sol is situated between private homes with a 10:00 pm noise policy.  Resort faces Pacific Coast Highway, which some units could experience more noise than others.  Such as front units #6, 5, and 11.  Noticed the street noise while using the Media room located on PCH.

Keep in mind they are studio size. Avoid rooms 6 & 11, as they border the Pacific Coast Highway (We used a white noise app from our iPhone to cover the noise).

I had packed beach towels and everything for the sun, however, when we walked into the Beso Del Sol unit I found out that I didn't even need to have packed.  The Beso Del Sol had everything we needed.  We stayed in the Unit 10 which was perfect, it was at the end and we didn't have the traffic noise from the Pacific Coast Highway.  The rooms are small, however, it's a cozy and unique little place that is wonderful with the little kitchen and all the convenices of everything you need to cook.  The bathroom is quite small, but it can be utilized using the shelf for placing items. There is no air conditioning, but wasn't needed, even in the month of July.  We also used the fireplace one night!  The beach is just done the",July 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,46,437

It is directly on Pacific Coast Hghway and the traffic noise is a constant bother in the rooms and on the patio. Parking is very limited and do not bring a large car or SUV as the spaces are too small  Services are non existent other than a change of towels mid-week. If  you need extra soap, shampoo, toilet paper you will need to go to grocery to purchase it. No manager is on site.  The price is right for bonus weeks and the room is basic but modern and clean. The beach is a block away. Location is decent for the beach, restaurants, bars, etc. Not your typical timeshare  property, no fecilities of amenities on the property. ..................11 roms available and all are studio units.",May 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,47,437
