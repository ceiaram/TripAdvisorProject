My first impression was about how clean and neat the buildings are kept!  My room was the same way—-very clean and comfortable!  Nice to have a small fridge and microwave oven too!  The price I paid was actually less than other hotels I had searched out, and breakfast was included!  Nice selection of breakfast foods and fruit too!  I had the hard-boiled eggs and a muffin plus orange juice—-again, even the eating area is very clean and inviting.   There is also a heated swimming pool and a business center and a laundry room too!

In fact, we are remodeling all of our rooms, scheduled in such a way as to not disturb guests just seven years after the hotel was completely remodeled and redecorated.  Regarding the carpet, we assure you that it is clean.  We vacuum and spot clean daily plus deep clean carpet twice a year.  I suspect what you may be referring to is the way the carpet fabric lies.  For example, I was inspecting hallways this week and the carpet was just cleaned, when you walked one direction the carpet appeared lighter than when you walked in the opposite direction.  This may be an explanation for your feeling the carpet did not look clean.  One of the advantages we have at the Lodge is our housekeeping manager has been with us for thirty years and she is very strict on making sure all rooms are very clean.

Located within walking distance of Mother's Market - for you vegetarians, and Carrows for the rest of you, there's comfort in knowing you don't need a car to get a bite to eat.  Every morning the hotel serves breakfast - oatmeal, fruit, cereal, coffee, tea. The microwave and fridge came in handy as I shopped at Mother's and ate in my room  to save a few bucks.  Just remember to turn your fridge ON when you arrive.  Room was clean, and elevator or steps get you to the second and third floors.

28 helpful votes,42 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Decent Motor Inn; Overstated Breakfast; Rude Manager,"Stayed here for a few nights in August. Because I had no idea how long my business would keep me in California, I was looking for a place willing to negotiate a rate. Spoke with the manager, Martin, who agreed to take ten dollars off the room per night and put me in a room where I could stay ""up to a week"" if need be--at the same rate. So far, so good. On my second day there, Martin  asked me to move to a different room. When I reminded him of what he promised me, he claimed he had never spoken to me before and that I was confusing him with someone else who worked there. Unbelievable.

Our family has owned and operated the Laguna Hills Lodge for 40 years and the average length of employment of our dedicated staff is 14 years.   We would like to clarify a few issues for our guest and anyone who reads this.  Unfortunately, when this guest booked his room for one night with the request to stay an additional day or two as needed, our hotel was at nearly full occupancy.   Because of that, we were able to accommodate him but could not guarantee a 3-night stay in the same room.  As far as the price we quoted this guest, he was offered our lowest available rate.  We invite this guest to contact us directly if he needs to discuss this further. Lastly, this guest made an unpleasant comment about our “overstated” breakfast.  We call our meal service an “extended continental breakfast” because besides the usual offerings we add hard-boiled eggs, a large variety of yogurts and fresh seasonal fruits, bakery items toasted to order, etc.  We have never before received any complaints about our breakfast.
