On top of this, their managers hide in the back room leaving their front desk staff powerless.  I have stayed here many times and after what I encountered today will never return.  On top of this I am seeing if Hilton or Hyatt will status match my ambassador status with Bonvoy.  The management is very rude and uses an accusatory tone contradicting what their front desk staff say.

Be aware of the Destination Fee.,"Had a free night certificate expiring with Marriott and decided that the best use of it would be redeeming it at  Lido House.

We encountered cozy sitting areas on the second floor decorated with multi-story length ropes.   Room and bath were fine.  Connecting room doors were the usual problem and let in guest noise.

It’s a fun location in Newport close to Lido shopping Center with trendy restaurants around. The problem is, for the price that you are paying, you are not getting any of the service or views of a fine hotel. Most of the rooms are facing the parking lot, and the other side is facing the street. There’s construction going around, so your views are mostly of construction, parking lot, and street. The service is spotty. My friend asked for water at the pool area and the server gave her a bottle, but when I asked for the same thing from another server, she wanted to charge me.

Beautifully-appointed, nautical-themed hotel right by the busy Newport Blvd. not on the water. 15 mins from OC airport.   Upon arrival I went straight to the bar and paid $42 for two bloody Mary’s.   The room decor is really nice but the closet is tiny. The TV reception was not good. And two of the 3 HBO channels were blank.   The rooftop bar is a great spot for people watching. Bring your Botox.   We didn’t try the restaurant. I did order a $12 yogurt parfait that was delicious.   We did take advantage of the complimentary bikes and ride on the beach (5 blocks away).

The actual facility was very nice. A beach theme ran throughout the hotel. The dining room looked nice but was quite busy. The outside bar area was quite nice and very busy. A rooftop bar had yet to open but the design was excellent. I do wonder if, when opened, this bar which was above some rooms could prove to be undully noisy for the rooms underneath. I would think it could prove to be a bit noisy for certain rooms.  We stayed in an ocean view room.
