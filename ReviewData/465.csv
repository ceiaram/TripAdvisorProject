55 helpful votes,105 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Good for Vietnamese folks who don't speak English; average motel,"It's an average motel that caters to visiting Vietnamese. Rooms are in decent shape, there's a pool, but the biggest draw is LOCATION, almost in the heart of Little Saigon. Walking distance to a couple of Vietnamese supermarkets and dozens of restaurants, as well as a Target, Starbucks, Carl's Jr., 99 Cents Only store.",October 2015,Get an upstairs room for less noise.,Traveled with friends,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,465
