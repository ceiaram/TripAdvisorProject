There are only 15 rooms on the two-story property, all facing a busy street. I was assigned room 303, on the ground floor in the middle of 6 rooms. It was nicely painted with neutral colors and one accent wall. It had a rather large mini-refrigerator (with freezer compartment), microwave, in-room safe, iron and ironing board, Keurig coffeemaker (with 2 K-cups, 2 liquid creamers, and cardboard cups), and a quite small LCD wall mounted TV (Cox Cable 500 channels, good variety).

Great location to the base and very charming town. Price was the best! Fridge and microwave were first rate. Rooms were clean and comfortable. No ice machine, but convenience store is in close proximity. The reason I titled this hospitality is because my son left his vehicle parked here all weekend as well as our car. I was concerned we would be reprimanded or worse, towed because parking is at a premium all over southern California. I was thankful they let us keep it parked.

I had called directly and the owner was very friendly and accommodating. The room was located in a convenient and easily accessible area with a 24 hour convenience store across the street. The room was clean and had all of the necessary amenities. During the afternoon and evening the traffic was loud but it subsided when it was time to turn in and did not affect our night's sleep.  One observation - when I went to make coffee in the morning, it looked like the previous guest had made coffee and the pot hadn't been cleaned (I opted for the convenience store across the street).

He had overnight liberty that night and had to stay with a buddy so we had 5 of us.  We got 2 rooms with 2 queen beds each at the Hotel Miramar for $160 including tax.  I believe that was $75 / room before tax.  That is a good price for 2 queen beds.  I was impressed at how clean and comfortable the room was.  I enjoyed the coffee, the internet, the fancy soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion and the shower.  My only complaint was that the bed had only a sheet and a comforter.
