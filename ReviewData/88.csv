There have been some hits & misses along the way, but ES Sonesta is a hit in our book.  We stayed at this hotel for several weeks on a job assignment, and it didn't miss a beat. Five star reviews are rarely given, but in this case it is justified.  Accommodations are clean & the beds super comfy. Housekeeping is exemplary. Most days a tasty hot breakfast with many options is served. By judging an establishment we start with costumer service and the Front Desk. This particular one is outstanding with special kudos to Manager Mario who goes above & beyond accommodating guests. His battery simply doesn't run out.
