Our guest room on an upper floor was quiet and we both had a good nights sleep - much needed after the parks! Included breakfast was plentiful and staff more than happy to serve it 'to go' for those enthusiastic to hit rope drop at Disneyland.  Didn't get a chance to use the pool but looked nice - don't expect a sprawling lagoon - but that is fairly standard for Anaheim hotels.

If you are looking for a clean, quiet and “reasonably” priced hotel near the parks, I could not recommend this property more.   The hotel itself lacks many of the amenities that those with small children may be looking for, eg the on-site restaurant is only open for breakfast and the hotel only has a hot tub without a swimming pool - but, if you are the typical Disney visitor and plan to be at the parks and eating corn dogs all day long, this is likely not a deal breaker.

The premises are spotless inside and out.  From the evidence the hotel was another brand and worn out before being remade as an Indigo. Too many traces of the old hotel remain. Our room almost had the modern, clean, Indigo look, but the sheet metal bed frame rattled when every time we got on or off the mattress. This could have been lots of fun if we wanted to give the neighbors something to talk about. The steel room doors have that 10 coats of paint look of a Red Roof room.

We stayed for three days and used Hotel Indigo as our base for both Disney’s California Adventure and Knott’s Berry Farm.  For starters this hotel is very reasonably priced, especially considering its proximity to Disneyland.  It is only a short 5-10 minute walk to the Disneyland entrance, and having free parking makes it a much less cumbersome option to parking in the Disney lots.  Also the trip to Knott’s was a reasonable 15 minute drive away.  The rooms are clean with laminate floors and a rug at the beds.

Room was clean and new-ish. Appreciated the Aveda amenities. A bit cramped for four but we could deal with it for two nights. Key to comfort in the hot summer months will be to leave the AC at 68 the entire time - once the room gets hot the AC has a hard time cooling it back down. Pool was sparking clean and well maintained (watched the pool guy doing his thing). Gym was clean and reasonably equipped. We didn't eat in the hotel place - tons of other eating places within two (longish) Anaheim blocks, suitable for both adults and kids. Disney main entrance about a half-mile walk away.

We loved that the hotel was 2.5 blocks from the main gate of Disneyland. It is a safe and well lit easy walk. However after walking about 10 miles all over Disney even a short walk can feel longer at the end of the day. We learned that there was a Disney bus system called ART that takes you from Disney to all of the local hotels. There are 2 bus stops for the #6 bus conveniently located on either side of the hotel. We decided to get passes ($5/day) from the Crowne Plaza next door.  We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Indigo so much that we stayed here again a week later. The front desk staff is great.

We take great pride and initiative in maintaining our exterior as well as our interior of our entire property in order to keep it looking neat, clean, organized and professional for all our guests and repeat guests to experience. The challenge is that we of course are open 24 hours, 7 days a week and really there is never a good moment to perform upgrades, maintenance, etc...without a slight inconvenience to our guests, but we certainly post notices through out the hotel and in all rooms. My sincerest apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Although we would have certainly preferred a 5 star rating from a guest such as yourself, we greatly appreciate your recommendations to others! I hope that  you will grant us another opportunity to demonstrate to you that we are indeed a 5 star hotel property.

We were going to Disneyland for 3 days and this hotel came up as one of the best ranked in the area. For 2 adults and 2 kids it worked well even though the room only came with 2 queen beds, the staff folded out a couch into a third bed which gave both kids a bed to themselves. Location was good as it was only a 15 minute walk to Disneyland and 5 minutes away from some good restaurants at the Anaheim Gardenwalk.

Upon first arriving at the hotel, I thought I may had found a new go to hotel when visiting Disneyland! The room was beautiful with a nice bathroom stocked with Aveda products. However, my impression of Hotel Indigo quickly changed.  When renovating the hotel they made an epic fail by installing thermostats that don't have an option to keep the fan running constantly. You could only set to heat or AC and have it cycle on and off. I don't understand why any hotel would do this, but luckily few hotels are this thoughtless in their planning.

We've stayed at a few other Indigo Hotels, and this one definitely seemed a bit more like a random chain hotel with an Indigo ""skin"" or something.

Since I had read the reviews, I asked for a room in back and on an upper floor, without a connecting door.

The music from the fountains ends at 10, and we were out every night until after 11.  Not as convenient as the Grand Californian or other Disney hotels, but the room was very nice.

Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful (particularly Arthur). The room was clean and furnished nicely.  I was under the impression that the Indigo chain had a more boutiquey feel about it however in my opinion the rooms/hotel were typical Holiday Inn rooms.  There is a small pool and outdoor seating area but we didn't use this due to the short nature of our stay. The best thing about this hotel is the close proximity to Disneyland parks.  They are two blocks away and the walk takes approximately ten minutes.  It's therefore incredibly easy to nip back to the hotel for a break in the middle of the day.

We had three people in a family room, my wife, 5 year daughter and myself.  Overall we were very happy with the hotel - it has been recently refurbished and our room was clean, spacious and modern.  We paid extra for a family suite and it was worth it to have the extra seating area.  The hotel is right on the main strip and 2 minutes walking distance to loads of restaurants - California Pizza Kitchen, Bubba Gump, McCormick and Schmicks - lots of choice.  Even better, only a 10-15 minute walk to Disney which was great as that was the purpose of our stay - meant we could get to the park when it opened and not have any parking charges etc.  The thing that I loved most about the room was that we",December 2013,none,none,"Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay with us.

Room nicely decorated and spotless... considering the proximity to Disney Land, I'm sure keeping a hotel this clean is a finely-orchestrated effort. The breakfast is also kind of chintzy--I got a voucher for breakfast and then was handed a menu. I assumed the voucher was good for what was on the menu. I was told I could only order the $10 ""hearty breakfast"" (not all that hearty TBH), but not the $7 pancakes????? Huh? Then one of the morning coffee and OJ was no problem. The next day, OJ was like an extra $3!   But my biggest complaint is the ""Wi."" Why just wi? Well, ""WiFi"" stands for ""wireless fidelity."" There *is* wireless, but I can't report much fidelity.

The next morning we had breakfast which was offered for only $10 for 4 people when we booked the hotel. While sitting at breakfast we had my almost 2 year old daughter throwing fits and they were so friendly about it. They started giving us free stuff to help her stop crying like crackers and a muffin and juice. Each one of the staff members would come up to us and ask if everything was ok, not just our waiter. The only downfall was that our room got very hot at night and for some strange reason it felt very humid even with the air turned on. I don't really know why it felt so humid!
