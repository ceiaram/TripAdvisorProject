1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Do not stay here,"Our first impression of this place was good the lobby looks nice and quaint. Once you get upstairs is where disaster hits. the carpet in the hallways are absolutely filthy. And the room looked a little run down and dated. We understood this was an older place so we gave it the benefit of the doubt. We all took a nap because we had just driven eight hours to get there. we go out to dinner and the morning after we realize how absolutely gross this place is. We found a used condom under the mattress, we found a couple stains on the walls. For some reason we didn't have a clock. There wasn't hot water the lady downstairs told us we needed to run the sink for some time in order to get hot water into the tub. we had an iron but no ironing board.

Our room was clean and neat, there is a cable tv and free breakfast. And the parking was free as well.

8 helpful votes,24 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Needed a place to stay near Los Alimatos Medical Center,"We picked this motel as we were visiting my brother at the nearby hospital. This place could be much better with a little more effort from the staff.  The room seemed OK until I went to turn on the heater which smelled like it had never been cleaned, burning dirty dust. It was also so loud we could not leave it on. The shower had sand in it from the last guest  which was pretty nasty. The coffee was not only bad I had a hard time even finding any powdered creamer. The staff seemed like they were not happy to be there which reflected in the condition of this motel.

We ended leaving and forfeiting our remaining nights because it was so bad. Our flight arrived at 9am at John Wayne and we called to see if they could accommodate us to come in earlier than 3pm, on a Wednesday...It wasn't even an option, and the hotel was empty when we arrived.

5 helpful votes,8 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good and comfortable hotel close to Disney,We are from Colorado and we stayed there for 4 nights during our visit to Disneyland and Universal studios. As we don't want to change hotel (with small kids with us) for Universal studios so we stayed here only.  It is around 10-15 mins drive from Disney but around 1 hr from Universal studios. Hotel is overall comfortable to stay with all basic amenities.  Even though it says complimentary breakfast but not many options for vegetarians. Also many eating places in 10-15 mins walking distance,March 2017,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,8,499
1 helpful vote,7 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Motel in disguise,"Stayed there April 2017. Elevator was down. Front desk acted like it was being repaired but you could peek behind a door on the third floor elevator foyer, and see that they were using the area for storing fold away beds. Stair access was outside. The stairwell was indoors but dirty; carpet was gross, dirt on walls, cobwebs. The inside of the building was being painted. The bed was comfy, great pillows. A/C worked well, hot water was abundant, towels were threadbare. The room appeared to be clean except the sofa had stains and the carpet was dirty and needs to be replaced. Little fridge worked great. Ice machine was outside, like a motel would have it. Area was sketchy. We walked to a strip mall behind the hotel and there was a homeless person sleeping in the parking lot.

10 helpful votes,22 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Avoid at all costs,"From the moment we walked in, this facility screamed revulsion.  With the elevators out of service, apparently for a long time, we proceeded to take the stairs to the third floor.  Between the mold formations on the door frames and the carpeting that has not been cleaned since the Hoover administration, we were already thinking this is not a place to stay.  The musty stench of the hallways were only surpassed by the foulness of stale cigarettes that wafted from our non-smoking room upon opening the door.  The furniture was broken, the roof to the closet fell on my head when I opened that and the beds had a permanent sag like an old field horse's back.  As for the bathroom, I do not think one would feel clean after showering- not that we even tried.  We stayed just long enough to",March 2017,I recommend you have a tetanus shot prior to visiting.

none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't bother!!,"Stayed at this hotel on a family trip to disneyland for the night. This hotel blows! Driving up to the parking lot I see they are remodeling the exterior of this hotel. Fair enough not big issue. While walking in hotel lobby I saw a drug exchange go down in the parking lot. I minded my own business. The front office guy was professional. Got our keys and walked towards the room.  Walked in and bam!!! It was outdated, dusty, dirty and so bare. Like seriously the carpet had left over gun stains. The bathroom had rust stains on counter and the bedroom of the hotel carpet had humps!!!   Not worth staying at this place.

Breakfast is bagels and cereals. Internet is the slowest you would expect, but it comes. The carpet around the mini fridge was damp( God knows why) and the whole room smelled of i dont know what.  We came only to sleep at around 10:00 PM all three days and were back to enjoying in Disneyland for the day The good things to us were: Disneyland is pretty close by ( 6 miles) There are a lot of food options at walkable distance, Chinese\Japanese\thai and Mexican are just 2 min walk.",October 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,13,499

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you like cold showers, this is your dream destination!","We're starting a list of places never to stay again just because of this place. We stayed 2 nights for a Disney ""Dapper Day"" vacation because the hotel is about 15-20 minutes away.  Here are our top 6 reasons never to stay here again:  1. We had NO HOT WATER when we tried to shower in the morning, both mornings! 2. The towels were threadbare and had lipstick stains and long black hairs on them 3. The free breakfast is only served for one hour between 8-9am, and the cleaning staff was milling around in front of the coffee and juice machine and seemed annoyed that we wanted to get to the machines. They only have bagels, pre-packaged bear claws, cereal, orange colored juice, and coffee. 4.

I made a reservation online. After a 7 hours driving I just wanted to enjoy my bed, which I did pretty quickly after the clerk in the front desk helped me out to check in. My room is very nice and clean, enough space for me and my 3 children. There are microwave, mini fridge, coffee machine, hair dryer, iron with table, and two comfy chairs! I took a nap while my kids enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi, even a small fitness center. This morning we had a free breakfast which was good enough compared with other hotels we had been into.
