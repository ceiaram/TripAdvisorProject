First impression was a little doubtful as the tiny checkin office is a little unkempt and the staff although friendly could definitely be more professionally dressed.There is not an elevator but it is only 3 floors. The steps are in need of paint which would help with that first impression. Then we stepped into our very lovely third floor Harbour view jacuzzi room! It was perfect for our stay! Spacious and modern with a lovely Harbour view. The shower pressure was fine and our bed was comfortable. The furniture modern. We had a fridge and microwave. Maid service was fine.

Check in took about 30 minutes because the guy couldn't find our reservation. He took my credit card and ID to the back room while talking on the phone to someone in a different language. This didn't make me feel very good about the security of guests' information. The blue carpet is dirty and in need of replacing. The bed was lumpy and the shower had black spots all over. In the door frame to the bathroom, someone had carved explicit words. We would have moved hotels, but they have strict no refund rules.

I liked its amazing location, right on Pacific Coast Highway beetween Seal and Huntington beaches, and the fact that they welcomed pets as this was the first time my dogs were visiting dog beach. The room was very airy and the bed was very comfortable. It is obvious that they try to make the guests comfortable by all the little extra steps they take and that one doesn't usually find in low cost hotels.  The price was reasonable, with a $10 extra per dog, which is not unusual.  I would like to see them update the hotel a bit. I think removing the run-down, torn, blue carpet from the stairs and common areas and replacing it with washable floors would do a lot for the hotel.
