The building is ocean front but the room is shoddy. No kitchen table.The patio has the dining table which you cannot use on a rainy day. The kitchen is described as a full kitchen but very small and the breakfast counter can only accommodate one counter height chair. The sliding bedroom door cannot be opened completely. Very small bedroom and the flat screen TV in the bedroom was just nailed to the top of a corner cabinet.

However, the property has not been maintained well, several items in the condo did not work (dishwasher; entry door; hair dryer, to name a few).  Stairway to the beach was not useable (broken stairs - looked like the problem had been there for quite a long time).  The layout of the condo was poor.  When the murphy bed is down, there is less than 6"" to the wall, so really hard to walk past it to get to the door or the kitchen.

Out of the 20 rooms (according to our estimate), all but maybe 6 are ocean front.  The odd-numbered rooms are ""Village View"" which means bus and truck exhaust and lots of street noise.  All the rooms are located on 3 floors with the majority of those rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors.    But this time wow!  Our room #312 was all we could have hoped for (view-wise).  Breath taking sunsets and steps-to-the-beach proximity were perfection.  Those ""steps"" do include a very large staircase between Laguna Surf and the beach.

Once upon a time, it was a true gem (we remember, we lived here in Laguna Beach then when it was built) but today, it is small and cramped with awkward living areas.

It is a good hike up and down the stairs so if you have any limitations getting to the beach directly from the condos may be any issue. An alternative is to walk out the front of the units and walk down a bit and enter the sand on the Main Beach. I is an easy walk to many great restaurant's and shop's. If you dont have an ocean view you can see the ocean from many areas right outside you room. The room top jacuzzi is really nice and you can see both mountain and ocean views.

Unfortunately, due to other circumstances, we were only able to go for a Saturday night (April 26, 2014) stay. However, in the brief time we were there, it was an enjoyable experience.

Parking was secure and our after hours check-in was fine (office closes at 5 so manager left our keys in a lock box) Our brief experience with the staff was a positive one.

Most of these units for prime weeks are already assigned to owners so you may need to rent from one of them. If so the resort can provides names with weeks available. We were in a third floor unit facing the beach and we were very pleased. Yes the rooms are a little dated and small but we spent most of our time on the beach or the deck. There were two bathrooms, one bedroom, a murphy bed (so you could sleep up to 4), and a small but fully functional kitchen.

But we were given one of the other third, which are just across the hall and which we were told nearly always are given to those who aren’t owners and who didn’t reserve at least a year ahead.
