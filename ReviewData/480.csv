3 helpful votes,2 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Beware before you stay,"My fiance are not the type of people who care about the cosmetic stuff about hotel/motel rooms. But it was pretty bad. The outside of the motel looked decent. Until we got to our room door and had seen a big huge footprint on it. Once we opened the door, things got worse. We had seen a big huge stain on thr floor and we all know that stains happen but it was pretty bad. The rooms paint was chipping off. And then we looked in the bathroom. It was horrible. The toilet had stains on it and the curtian for the shower had red stains on it as well as the shower itself. No wifi which we didn't care about. It tooks us about 30 min to figure out what we wanted to do. We just didn't feel safe in the room. You can hear the people next to us talking really loud. If anyone had ever seen that",February 2015,none,none,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,480

Check-in: -the woman at the desk told us they didn't have our reservation and we were at the wrong motel (we should have just left right then). -my husband showed her the confirmation e-mail and she still told us we were in the wrong place (even though the motel's address was right there in black and white). -after checking again she was able to find our reservation.  The Room: -smelled like cigarettes -dirty carpet -stains on the ceiling -paint peeling from walls -doors to adjoining room had no door knobs and were lined with painters tape -a/c didn't work. the room was warm and stuffy almost the entire time. -long hairs found throughout -desk drawer was missing  The Bathroom: -smelled like urine -no light fixtures, just light bulbs sticking out of",May 2014,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,480
3 helpful votes,6 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Cheaper place to stay,"The clerk was friendly and helpful.  The room itself was less than average.  One of the threadbare towels had a black stain on it. An advantage of the hotel was that it was close to Disneyland and, as we didn't spend much time in the room, It worked out okay.",April 2014,none,Traveled with family,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,3,480

I called around and came upon Polynesian Motel and called to check availability. They only had a two bed smoking room left and I needed non smoking the clerk said he would save the room for me. When I arrived, he said I can check it out before I paid. He commented that he went in the room after I called and it smelled fine and there was no stench of smoke....he was right.

166 helpful votes,115 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Inexpensive (relatively) and Basic (very),"Looking for two rooms at a basic & inexpensive motel for a one-night stay near Disneyland, we selected the Polynesian from internet listings.   Upon arrival we discovered it was indeed basic and (relatively) inexpensive, with an emphasis on the “basic”.  After initially considering clicking ""poor"" I instead rated it ""average"" based on the price-to-value ratio.  The Polynesian is an older single-story bungalow style motel with rooms that were clean and appeared to have been rehabilitated at a fairly recent date.  Plumbing was all in order, the A/C unit worked properly and the beds were adequately comfortable.  Although located on a major street, it was quiet overnight.  As noted, this is definitely a “basic” motel.  The rooms had TV and refrigerators and there is a soft-drink",May 2012,none,Traveled with family,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,6,480

5 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good place to stay on a tight budget,"We were looking for a place to spend the night and came across this place online. With only 1 review I was kind of unsure. We were in town for only 1 night because we wanted to spend at least 1 day visiting Disneyland. The motel is about 5-10mins away[depends on traffic]. The room is kind of old but it was clean. I only paid $58 for a night so I wasn't expecting much as far as 5star goes. There was a little fridge in there,but no microwave. The a/c worked fine. It was one of those wall units. There were cleans towels,sheets and cable tv. Quiet at night and a nice pool to enjoy. There were no insects or bedbugs from what I could see. The only problem I had at this place was the bed was a bit firm for me but other than that it was okay. You can park right in front of your room",October 2010,none,none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,9,480
