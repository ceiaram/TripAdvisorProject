11 helpful votes,18 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Some Sites are Better than Others,"We reserved this site because we thought we would have ocean views and ocean access.  Instead, we had a site at the very top (site 11) and had a view of the tops of RVs and one large American Flag and bright light that one RV chose to hang way above their site.  So, views were obstructed for us.  As for ocean access, there is a tunnel, but it was flooded with dirty muck and we did not want to walk through that.  SO, we drove down the highway to Crystal Cove Cottages and walked down to the beach there.  In addition, there was not soap in the bathrooms, no counters or mirrors in the shower area (state park ya'll).  For $75 a night, I would expect to have some service.  Overall, we decided to leave the site after one day instead of staying the 2nd night.  I think if you have a site",August 2022,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,435
120 helpful votes,548 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beach Play,"We needed to go a beach that had less rocks on the beach. A family member told us to drive couple miles south of Crystal Cove Beach to Moro Beach. After paying for the park fee you drive down past hiking trails and camp grounds to a parking lot near the PCH (Pacific Coast Highway) There is a tunnel that goes under the PCH. Once you walk through there is an amazing beach, and ocean. We had a great time playing in the water and in the sand.

67 helpful votes,87 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Ridiculously Gorgeous Panoramic views,"Moro campground has insanely gorgeous views and I don't believe you can go wrong when choosing a campsite. The campground is in Canyon Cove State Park and is very well maintained. There are a variety of hiking trails above the campground and the trail to the beach is a strenuous but wonderful hike. You can also drive to the day use area and walk through the tunnel that goes under Pacific Coast Highway and right out onto the beach. The restrooms and showers are very clean and well maintained. The location is perfect as it is very close to Laguna, which is filled with great places to eat and shop.",February 2019,You can't go wrong!

3 helpful votes,8 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Worth it even if just for 1 night,"This place is incredibly difficult to book!  And for good reason.  I was lucky enough to get 1 night and I'm so glad I did.  It was a dream night of camping overlooking the ocean.  We ate dinner and watched the sunset at the shake shack down the street which is the local hot spot on the ocean.  There is a staircase and tunnel that will lead you there and parking across the street.  The campground is very clean, supports your own private beach, and it is terraced so everyone has a great view.  There are no bad spots.  There are RV spots on top and tent spots on bottom.  We tent camped and it's important to remember that the winds come up so anchor your tents.  I only got one night, but it was the best camping I've ever done and we have camped a lot.  It's worth doing for whatever",February 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,435
8 helpful votes,54 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,What a great trip,Bit of a hike bjt more than worth it . The trails start with multiple routes we chose to start up the first path . It's a gradual climb then switches to some cut backs and switch backs which all trails are manicured and very nice . Be advised if you're camping there is no water so what you pack is what you have so pack wisely . The campsite offers great views of catalina and newport coast . All sites include a table and are leveled out which is a plus . There is a porto pot up there lol this place is close to home and i say check it out you'll enjoy it if you're an avid backpacker .,April 2016,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,435
6 helpful votes,16 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Clean site with a great view!,"Stayed here for one night with my boyfriend for our anniversary. We stayed at #54 on the Dolphin Circle, no dolphin sightings but the view is amazing! There's a row of benches for you go sit and watch the sunset or just sit right in your site. Space for 2 cars and your tent, comes with a picnic table. Downside is your not allowed to stake your tent or have any fires whatsoever (though many of our neighbors did anyway). The bathrooms are VERY CLEAN!! No toilet seat covers though or soap to wash your hands. But all minor details. One downfall is that being on the dolphin loop is your near PCH so the car noise can be a bit noisy. But all in all its a peaceful, clean campsite that's great for a night or 2. We stayed during the week so only paid $38 for our one night! Highly",March 2016,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,6,435

Because we had no previous reservations, we had to move spots, but it was worth the move, second spot was even better than the first. Book early, as the electric sites go fast. I agree, bring your binoculars and enjoy. If you have kiddos, take them to the other beaches for tide pooling.  If you have pups, the rules are pretty limiting for dogs.  No dogs on beach and no dogs on trails. Only negative I could possibly find.",February 2015,none,none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,7,435
148 helpful votes,344 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wonderful sites and great stay!,"Stayed at the Moro Campsites this past weekend and had a great time with the family.  The lower portion of Moro Campsite is mostly for tenters, which is nice as the RV/trailers are at the higher levels of the campground.  The sites are tiered on a bluff, allowing all sites to have great views of the ocean.  Dolphin siting were plentiful from the campsite and sunsets are amazing...bring your binoculars.  Vegetation is still growing in, but sites are relatively large and afford a decent amount of privacy from neighboring sites.  Bathrooms and showers are clean and well maintained by the rangers.  The beach is a big walk down a hill to the beach access tunnel.  You can drive down and drop off items or park, though the day use parking spots fill up quickly.  Your camp site pass does",August 2014,none,Traveled with family,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,8,435
