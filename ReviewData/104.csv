The entire negative experience revolved around your misunderstanding of the room rates for your visit.  Your original reservation was a Sunday arrival for one night.  You then contacted the hotel to change the arrival date to the preceding Thursday for three nights, which brought in the seasonal weekend rates for Friday and Saturday.  The revised confirmation we emailed to you for your extended reservation included the price breakdown for each day; and finally, the registration documents you signed upon check in showed the daily rates for the room.  We encourage all guests to carefully review these documents when they book a room.  We believe that had you read any of these documents, the entire confrontation between you and our front desk associate probably never would have happened.  There was absolutely no “bait and switch” as you claim.  Our front desk clerk, Zach, tried to explain all this to you, but you were not interested in hearing.  We regret that you responded inappropriately towards Zach with slurs and threats of physical violence, leaving the hotel staff with no alternative than to offer to call the police for resolution.  Multiple witnesses saw and heard the exchange.  We do not tolerate slurs or threats by any guest against any staff member.

It is unfortunate that almost all hotels have had to adopt the policy of pre-authorizing credit cards for anywhere from $100 - $200 extra to try and protect themselves from damages, theft or in room smoking violations caused by guests.  Although these issues are infrequent, they are very costly to hotels.  As far as when the authorization hold is put back in your account - that all depends on the bank or credit card company.  We release the hold as soon as you check out.  It seems that most of the time, cardholders see the funds back in their account within 72 hours, but we advise people that it could be up to five days, just to be safe.    Car rental companies have used this security authorization policy for years.  Hotels usually only placed an additional hold of $20 - $50 for incidentals, but as the industry has seen the trend to more damage from guests, we had to increase the amount.

The breakfast isn't worth the time to go pick it up. Gross packaged muffins and a granola bar. The hotel really should refund part of the price back to the customer. The staff is nice.,November 2020,none,none,"I appreciate the directness and candor in your review and can certainly understand your opinions.  Yes, the Marina Shores is not one of the newer buildings in Dana Point, but we like to think that's part of our charm and history.  Each time the hotel undergoes a renovation, the design people work hard to preserve our older period look with new furniture and fixtures.  The musty smell we get from time to time during the off season like this comes primarily from some of the rooms not being used as often as they are during the summer, but one of the other things we've noticed is that the special Covid-19 disinfectant we're using after guests check out seems to hang in the air longer with the doors and windows being closed ... if we left everything open, the rooms might smell fresher, but it would defeat the purpose of the disinfectant.  No excuses ... a noticeable odor is a noticeable odor.  We HAVE updated our housekeeping processes a bit to address this.  If a room sits vacant for more than two days after spraying, we are opening the windows and balcony doors to let some of the fresh air in.  Hopefully that will remedy the problem once and for all.  The breakfast too has been a victim of all the pandemic protocols.  We were forced to shut down our hot breakfast buffet months ago to be in compliance with the Board of Health directives - only food that comes in prepackaged containers can be served.  That's why we have such a limited menu.  I assure that we HAVE taken this into account with our room pricing ... our rates are much lower than they were last year at this time, mainly because we understand that any ""savings"" we experience due to the limits the CDC, the State of California and local ordinances place on the hotels needs to be passed on to our guests.   I appreciate all your comments and observations.  Hopefully, this reply has addressed some of them for you.  We hope you will continue to be our guest the next time you return to Dana Point.

Although the Coronavirus pandemic has decimated the lodging industry, at the Marina Shores we are striving to provide what guests we have with some feeling of ""normalcy"" during their stay.  Most all of the major hotel brands have stopped serving the free breakfast as a way to cut costs during these leaner times.  At the Marina Shores we are still serving our hot breakfast five days a week (Grab & Go bags on Mondays and Tuesdays) albeit with a less expanded menu.  While the County's preference is that all hotels close their pools during the pandemic, we opted to turn off the heater to ""discourage"" people from using it and posted a sign that asks that no more than six people be in the pool area at any time.  That way, they can adhere to the six-foot social distancing guidelines, but still soak up some sun if the ocean isn't to their liking.  At the forefront of everything, we are concerned and vigilant about the health and safety of both our guests and our staff.  We appreciate that our guests have been respectful of the rules and restrictions we've had to put in place .

However, the room (a ""king suite"") is way too small. It had the least counter space of any hotel I have stayed in for the last 20 years. There was barely a place to put a toiletries bag. The sink is tiny. The tub is tiny. The bathroom is tiny.  There are no free-standing tables . . . the dressers are covered by lamps and big TV's.

It was also our first (and definitely last) stay at a Best Western property. Here's a quick recap of the pros and cons. I try hard to be objective in my reviews and this is no different. The negatives outweigh the positives by more than enough to justify the overall rating.   PROS:   1. The location is good. It's not too far from Laguna Beach, and its proximity to other beaches is a big advantage and the biggest reason one would stay here.  2. The staff are welcoming, although they can only do so much. 3. The rooms (we had a third-floor suite) are decently-appointed and clean on the inside.   CONS:  1.

While we are proud of the fact that we are one of the few pet friendly hotels in town, we fully realize that we are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the negligence of any pet owners who stay here ... and for that, I am truly sorry.  That small space below the partition is just the building design to assist with drainage in the event of a heavy rain.  To clarify with the power outage - an automobile had hit a pole several blocks north of the hotel and a large section of Dana Point was without electricity while the repairs were being made.  All of the restaurants and businesses along our section of PCH were without power, so it had nothing to do with us.  We do our best to make our guests as comfortable as possible when things like this happen ... we provide flashlights or heavy duty glow sticks so they can get around, but a backup generator large enough to power the entire hotel would have to be huge and would simply be impractical.  I've checked with most of the hotels in town and one of the five-star resorts has a generator to power lights in the public areas, but none have the facilities to keep their entire hotel supplied with electricity.  Just like at home, we are dependent on the fast and efficient service of our local power company.  Fortunately, the repair crews from SDGE do an excellent job, so when our area does lose power due to accidents or other causes, they generally restore service very quickly.

Once upon a time, there was a new hotel brand that pioneered the idea of networking hotels rather than franchising them.  Unlike franchises that are mostly cookie-cutter, no personality properties, this network of hotels formed a membership where they all referred guests to one and other, but each hotel was unique ... combining the best qualities of independent hotels with the marketing and purchasing power of the big franchises.  This was the concept that created Best Western.  As the years passed and the family of hotels grew, there became a huge inconsistency from one hotel to the next ... one could be a budget, no frills property along the highway and another could be a luxury, full service hotel in the heart of metropolitan America.  Travelers became confused because they didn't know what to expect from one Best Western to the next.  In 2011, Best Western created three separate tiers - Best Western, Best Western Plus and Best Western Premier - in an attempt to clarify for all travelers the level of service, quality and amenities they could expect during their stay.  I promise you, ""Best Western"" is not a name to be scared of (smiling).

It's always best to confirm your form of payment when checking into a hotel rather than when checking out.

If you want special arrangements made on your billing, we're happy to comply, but it works out alot better for the guests if we know to set it up that way when you arrive.  As with many of the other reviewers, I will again apologize for the crowds in our breakfast room.

We make every effort to thoroughly examine every piece of bathroom terry and all the bed linens after laundering them, just to make certain things like this don't happen.  I also went to the room immediately after reading your review and I did notice an edge of the tub where the finish was worn and not as white as the rest.  If this is what you noticed, I hope you will take comfort in knowing that is was not dirty and I will have our maintenance team address the finish on the tub right away.  Lastly, I assure you that other than the two room suites with couches in the living room fold out to a double bed, there is not one double bed in this hotel.  The smallest bed we offer is a queen.  The complementary breakfast is something that all hotels like ours will constantly be working on.  The trend in our industry is for all hotels to offer some type of breakfast and for those like ours that have no restaurant, the concept has to be quick, simple and free.  I fully admit that we don't offer a restaurant quality sit down meal, but for those looking for that added extra, there are plenty of restaurants nearby where you can get a cooked-to-order full breakfast.

We would never knowingly place a guest in a room in that type of condition.  I will advise the breakfast attendants about the salt in the eggs.

The staff at the hotel were super friendly and welcoming, and rooms spotlessly clean and comfortable.

We also appreciate your mentioning the EV chargers we provide for free to guests of the hotel.  In this day and age where hotels seem to find a reason to charge extra for amenities, it's nice to be able to offer this service at no cost.  You mentioned the ""partial view of the ocean"" and I want to clarify for ALL readers, we are a block and a half away from the ocean.  From our top floor rooms you can see the ocean through the palm trees across the street, but it's not like you can throw open your curtains and take in the majesty of the Pacific Ocean ... different booking sites online have very vague descriptors of our hotel and sometimes the wording can be a little misleading, so we always try to clarify the view whenever someone mentions it here.  I'm also glad that you mentioned the air conditioning and LACK of road noise.  Our proximity to the Pacific Coast Highway and the noise from the traffic that goes with it has been one of the most common complaints we've heard from our guests.  We've just finished installing central air conditioning in all of our two room suites.  This eliminated the old fashioned wall units that let in most of the noise from the outside world - not to mention the intended benefit of keeping these two room units uniformly cooled.  We are all very excited about this latest improvement and so far, most of the feedback has been exactly like yours - much quieter and much cooler!  Lastly, I am sorry that our free breakfast was not up to your expectations and I completely agree that a hotel without a full service restaurant simply cannot offer the same type of quality as regular food service establishment.  In addition to the restaurants you mentioned, there is also Stacks Pancake House across the street and the Harbor House Cafe about half a mile up PCH.

We are aware of the condition of some of the balconies and are in the midst of making all the repairs.  I'm sure you heard the construction noise during your stay.

The heavy rains we endured from December through March slowed the whole project down, but we are now in full swing and everything should be in beautiful shape in a few weeks.  Regarding the late check out ... it sounds like there was some kind of misunderstanding over our regular check-out time.  Check-out is at 11:00am, so if the desk extended you an hour to 12:00pm, that's why they were calling you at 12:30.  On the weekends, it is very difficult to extend our check-out time later than that because we have so many new guests coming in and our housekeepers need time to get their rooms ready, not to mention servicing the rooms for our stayover guests as well.

If you booked through a third party site, while we provide them with the same detailed information, we have no control over how they describe us or how they display the information.  Most hotels in Dana Point have parking in or below their buildings.  Real estate in a resort area is at a premium so it only makes sense to make the most out of the land available.  Occasionally we will have a guest with a loud motorcycle or car that echos through the garage and can be heard in the rooms, but most of our guests are considerate of that ... if only the folks cruising the Pacific Coast Highway were as nice.  From what you described about the air conditioner, it sounds like you had one of our two room suites.

It is our goal that every guest of the Marina Shores finds their accommodations to be clean, comfortable and an excellent value.  Bed comfort, as I have said in other reviews, is a very subjective opinion ... some people prefer the softest mattresses that they can just sink into after a long day, while others prefer some firmness for better support.  We replaced every bed in the hotel less than five years ago will pillowtop mattresses and foundations from Simmons.  I wanted to check the beds in the room you occupied, but there was another guest in it so I asked him and he felt they were extremely comfortable.  I assure you, this is not to challenge your opinion in any way ... it is just to show that everyone has different expectations when it comes to beds.  No guest should ever have to tolerate noise or discomfort - at our hotel or any other.  You are all paying for an experience.  One call to the front desk with a complaint or concern and the staff should leap to assist.  I am truly sorry you didn't report any of this when you were here.  We would have gladly moved you to a different room and offered you a free upgrade for your trouble if we had something available.  Lastly, I urge you to review your receipt or contact me directly if you don't have one.  Your room was nowhere near $250.00.  The rate was only $185, plus taxes, one night's parking charge and the $20.00 pet fee for your dog.  Over the holidays, hotel rates in town were extremely high, but we always keep ours at the low end of the market pricing so that our guests don't feel taken advantage of.  I closing, I want to stress to you and anyone else who may read this review ... don't ever settle for less than you expect from ANY hotel you stay at.  If you have a concern, let management know and give them the opportunity to fix it for you.  It is a sad fact about our society ... we have gotten so used to poor customer service that we almost accept it as the norm.  It doesn't matter if you're at a ""Motel 6"" or a 5-star resort ... cleanliness, comfort and a peaceful night's sleep are the minimum expectations any guest should have ... and any good hotel will go out of their way to meet those expectations ... and THEN some!",none,none,none,none,none,none,358,104

I",June 2016,none,none,"Part of the training for all new hires at the front desk of the Marina Shores is a discussion on how the guest's perception is our reality.  This review is a perfect example of how a guest can see or hear things to be a certain way and we owe it to them to validate their concerns and offer our apologies for what they perceive as failings in service no matter what we think actually transpired.  This I did directly with the guest in several private email exchanges.  I also refunded all of her money because nothing I could have said to her would change her perception of what she believed happened during her stay.  I had hoped she would accept my apology and refund as a gesture of good faith, but apparently this was not the case and for that, I am also sorry.  We never tell our guests that they will have a ""beautiful ocean view.""  On our websites and in all our literature it states that we are located a block and a half from Doheny State Beach.  There are tall trees across the street between us and the beach so only our suites on the third floor get any view of the water and we tell people they will have an ocean ""peek,"" not an ocean view.  Yes, this guest did request a view of the water when she made her reservation online, so we assigned her a room at the end of the building closest to beach, but no one ""raved"" about any beautiful view.  This guest had reserved a two room suite and yes, the entrance to the living room portion does face a large, concrete retaining wall on the back of our property.  It is the bedroom balcony that faces the Pacific Coast Highway and provides the view.  The group of people this guest encountered when she left the lobby and headed toward her car were simply a bunch of rude and inconsiderate young guys waiting for a friend of theirs to come down from his room.  Since being rude isn't a crime, all we could do was tell them to wait for him outside  Our security guard asked them to move away from the doors as a courtesy to the guests who were entering and exiting the building.  While there was no need for concern - they weren't approaching anyone or bothering anyone - we did call the local authorities and ask them to do a drive by, just as a precaution.  When the reviewer returned to the front desk to check out, she expressed her concerns to the clerk on duty.  Apparently when the clerk offered her assurances that everything was fine and there was nothing to worry about, the guest took that as being ""snotty.""  If we had done what the guest suggested in her review and have everyone wait inside, that would have caused a needless panic and upset alot of people.  Lastly, regarding the concrete dust this guest claims was on her car when she returned home, she also said that she spent her last two days in Dana Point at another hotel, so we can't be sure if the debris even came from here.  I asked her to send me a photo that I could pass on to the painting contractor that had been working here the day she stayed but she never sent one.

Our goal is for every guest to enjoy a clean, trouble free room and to receive warm, friendly service ... obviously there will be occasions where something will go wrong - in this case a noisy air conditioner - then the important thing is that the hotel (any decent hotel, anyway) leaps to correct the issue as soon as they become aware.    Now, regarding the parking fee ... most of the hotels in our area charge for parking.  Of these hotels, our $10/night fee is the lowest.  Many of the hotels charge a mysterious ""resort fee"" (I don't think anyone has actually figured out what that fee covers) and some hotels actually charge that in addition to the parking.  We stress that, even if you add the nightly parking to our room rate, you still come out paying less than you would at any mid-tier hotel in our market.  I have to assume that the Hilton you were referring to wasn't the one in Dana Point because they actually DO charge for parking; $22.00/night.

You kind of have me on the ropes here because anything I might say beyond apologizing could be taken as an excuse and I don't want to give that impression.  There are many reviews that mention the traffic noise from the Pacific Coast Highway so when people ask for a quiet room we make every effort to pre-assign a room on the back side of the building whenever possible.  The only time we can't do anything about this is when a guest reserves a whirlpool suite or a two-room suite - all those are on the front side of the building.  When this happens, we try to contact the guests ahead of time to let them know so they can make an informed decision on their stay.  I don't know what room type you had, but if we dropped the ball on this, that was clearly our fault and I am sorry.  If you don't mind contacting me directly at the hotel to let me know what room you were in, I can make sure the mattress is replaced.  All our beds were replaced in 2012 as part of a property-wide renovation so usually any negative comment about the bed is just a matter of personal opinion - all our beds are the same make and model, yet a few people will find them too hard, others too soft.  If yours needs to be replaced, I would want to take care of it immediately so no other guests experience the same discomfort.  I'm truly sorry that you find my responses ""lame.""  Trip Advisor affords travelers the unique opportunity to read about the hotel experience from both sides of the counter.  Personally, I think that I owe my guests more than a generic apology.  Sometimes an explanation is in order and I do my best to offer that.  It's not a coincidence that the majority of the negative reviews come from people who reserved rooms through third party websites like Expedia and Priceline.  The information they provide cannot match the details available when you contact a hotel directly ... even if you book through these other sites, it's always advisable to call the hotel afterward to clarify your special requests or if you have any questions.  I'm not offering this as any more than a travel tip.  It doesn't excuse noise, low water pressure or an uncomfortable bed.

Clearly, the people who gave it high ratings don't get out much.",July 2015,none,none,"When responding to an unfavorable review, it is very difficult for a manager who takes a good deal of pride in his or her establishment not to feel defensive.  There is a reason why the Marina Shores is the top rated hotel in a market that includes three 5-star resorts.  The owners of this property invested over $1.5 million in 2012 to completely renovate the hotel - and with only 87 total rooms, that is a substantial investment.  Yes, the building is ""old"" ... as are most of the buildings in Dana Point.  This is a beach community with a lot of history.  The town has certainly grown up around the hotel.  The Pacific Coast Highway out front used to be a quiet coastal road, but as tourism grew, so did the traffic.  We replaced all the windows and sliding balcony doors with double-paned, sound dampening glass in an effort to combat the sound of the world growing outside.  Our rooms are clean.  We have won awards all three years we have been with Best Western for our cleanliness and upkeep.  This is one of the reasons you saw all the positive reviews.  The ""miserably soft"" beds you referred were part of the full renovation I mentioned earlier pillow-top mattresses and deluxe foundations which actually meet the standards for Best Western Premier hotels, far exceeding the specifications for the Best Western Plus we are.  ... and yes, I was the one you spoke to about the Starbucks.  I told you that I thought it was ""two blocks up the street,"" but I also had the desk clerk on duty confirm the distance for you because I was uncertain.  She said it was more than two blocks - although it is less than a mile (we googled it after reading your review.)  When she mentioned that it was past Golden Lantern, I specifically said, ""that's really a long way to walk, just for a cup of coffee.  If you want recommendations for breakfast, there are several restaurants closer.  One of the members of your party said, ""No, Starbucks is fine.""  I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but think your referring to us as ""not terribly bright"" is highly unfair.  Lastly, I understand that the staff went above and beyond to help a member of your group when a local dry cleaner did a disastrous job on one of your wedding dresses.  She arranged for last minute service with another establishment and saved the day for the mother of the groom.  In fairness, you could have mentioned that as well.  Spaciousness and elegance come with a very steep price tag.  The Marina Shores is the lowest-priced mid tier hotel in the Dana Point area.  Even still, we provide a level of friendly service that is unsurpassed.

Though my kids, and particularly m high school and college age children, were looking for the hot tub in vain, we liked it and would recommend the hotel. Add that hot tub, and you have a for-sure return family. The breakfast was, perhaps, one of the best complimentary breakfasts I have seen in years. We took walks to the Dana Point Marina, about a 15-minute jaunt, in the cool Christmas-time air, and were glad to have the opportunity.

I don't recall anyone seizing on the nuances of the Marina Shores and adding so much color.  We're glad you and your family enjoyed your stay, but I'm sorry we lacked the hot tub you were seeking.  Our heated pool is tucked into a very compact area and if we tried to add a spa, I'm afraid we'd lose the deck where our chaise lounge sunning area is located.

You get the view and the sensation that you are in the heart of what's happening in our town, but you are also correct ... when it's time to turn out the lights and snuggle down with one of our pillow top mattresses and soft comforters, it's best to close the window and the balcony door if you want some peace and quiet.  As far as the parking, our $10.00 fee is the lowest of all the hotels in the area that charge for parking and is also what keeps non-guests from parking in our garage when they don't want to pay $30.00 to park by the beach, which is just two blocks away.

Since you and I already spoke about the air freshener issue while you were, I'll address this to your readers.  Even though the Marina Shores Hotel has won awards for our cleanliness and ranks in the Top Five of all Best Westerns in that particular catagory, there are times when guests will cook in the microwaves and there is a trace of a food odor after they've checked out.  No matter how clean the room is, sometimes it just takes a day or two for the odor to disappear on its own.  Some hotels will use those industrial deoderizers that make a guest room smell like a hospital ... then you walk into a room and BAM!  Your nose tells you that they are trying to cover up something.  Our idea was to use the same type of plug in air fresheners that people use at home ... something that wouldn't appear as an assault on your senses.  Unfortunately - and you are 100% right - none of those solutions will bode well for people who are either allergic or have a hyper-sensitive sense of smell.

Or just a short hop in the car. The hotel looks like it has recently been re-done so everything was nice and new looking.  I was in a suite and it was very nice. The bedroom was in the back with a desk/work station and comfy bed, and a balcony with a chair. The room out front was the living room area that doubled as a second bedroom with the sofa bed.
