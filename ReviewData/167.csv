none,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great value,"Had a balcony king room on the 4th floor. It was spacious and clean. Balcony is very narrow but has a great view. Beautiful beach, you can walk to the pier where there are shops and restaurants in about 30 minutes. There's a closet in the lobby with extra towels, coffee etc. (no housekeeping). Most of the time there's an employee at the front desk, felt safe. Excellent restaurant next door. Short Uber ride to Laguna Beach or the Balboa Island ferry.

But, my only complaint is you can hear foot traffic in the room above you.  Perhaps this is an issue because the rooms do not have carpet. The first night was rough hearing a child constantly running around in the room till late and then up early in the morning.  The next day the  staff was great and let us move to another room, but unfortunately the following morning we were up at 6:30am due to the walking in the room above us.",October 2022,get top floor,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,167

When booking the hotel, registration requires you to download their app and submit a picture of your driver's license. Checkin is contactless where a key code is provided through the app. Slightly different process but everthing was smooth and efficient.  The Sonder is a smaller, no frills, limited amenities hotel. It worked great for us but may not for some. The employees we interacted with were friendly and professional. Parking is an additional cost with a small lot on site. A little tight and limited spaces. Overflow parking lot across the street.  The beach is a five minute walk across the Pacific Coast Highway.
