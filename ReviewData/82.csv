The location is hard to figure, especially after Sunset, owing to very poor lighting in the areas where directions are put up.   The hotel is clean, bathroom big enough, microwave and refrigerator in room, 24 hour coffee in the lobby, decent breakfast. The major problem with this place is that the walls are paper thin.

I am a very light sleeper and I had a tough time sleeping because of the continuous noise from the room/ hallway right above my room. There was a lot of noise even after 2 AM.

If there was a rating below ""poor"", that is the rating I would give them. This was the worst experience I have ever had at any hotel. It started at check-in when we were assigned to the handicap room. While I'm sure the accommodations are very helpful for a person needing this type of assistance, for a person who is not handicapped these devices get in the way and make enjoying the facilities virtually impossible. The bathroom is expanded out into the bedroom making the bedroom very small. The bathroom is stark, utilitarian, unattractive and cold. There is no counter space for bathroom items. The bathtub/shower is taken up mostly by a bench with the shower head attached to a hose and mounted on an adjustable bracket",July 2014,none,none,"Thank you for your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Holiday Inn Express San Clemente.  We take customer feedback very seriously as it helps us improve our product and service.  I did notice you copy and pasted your feedback on 3 very prominent review websites ensuring it would be read by as many potential guests as possible, so I will do my best to give an adequate response to your concerns.  I am very sorry that our handicap accessible room was not up to your standards.  I do understand our accessible rooms do have some different qualities about them and that these differences, that do help with mobility challenged guests, may hinder you from enjoying your room facilities.  California law requires all hotels to have a certain percentage of rooms that are handicap accessible, when these rooms are not booked by guests needing this specific type of accommodation, the hotel does rent them to non-handicap guests.  The date you stayed at our hotel was a Sell Out night, Saturdays in the summer are our busiest nights.   In order for us to accommodate all of the guests requesting a room on Sell Out nights we must rent these “accessible” rooms when needed.  Now I am unsure how or when you booked your reservation but many of the reservations that come through to the hotel are non-guaranteed room types.  This means that whatever room type is available when the guest arrives is the room that this guest receives.  I am assuming this is what happened with your reservation?  We did not put you in this “accessible” room to upset you or to hinder your stay with us, we put you in this room due to the fact it was, most likely, the only room we had available to fit the parameters of your stay.  I am also sure that the reason the front desk manager did not offer to move you to another room is because we did not have another option for your stay parameters.  If you read the majority of the other reviews regarding our hotel, our Front Desk team has been mentioned many times for their “Great Customer Service”.  I am sure if they were able to move you they would have.  As for our complimentary breakfast being “unhealthy and unappetizing”, we have recently had many changes to our breakfast to ensure there are healthy items available for our guests.  Some of the new “healthy” items we have added are; turkey sausage, oatmeal cups with topping station, greek yogurt, fresh fruit and a variety of healthy cereals.",none,none,none,none,none,none,305,82

If you want somewhere that the staff are very friendly and happy to see you but understand how you feel after an eleven hour flight and just over an hours drive to get there, this is your place. The hotel is  five minutes off the I-5, so very easy to find, and ten minutes from Del Mar (the main street). The room was very clean with a very comfy bed. It had a balcony which when out there you could hear the I-5 but with the door closed, not a sound. Breakfast is a buffet which has most things you could want from bacon & eggs to cereal and pancakes. The tea & coffee is available 24/7. Situated halfway between San Diego and LA it is ideal for exploring the lovely coastline. I am sold, so maybe i'll be back real soon.",August 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,371,82

After reviewing your reservation we found it was booked at a restricted rate type, with a cancellation fee and/or full pre-payment requirement. These restrictions allow us to offer discounted rates that would otherwise be unavailable. While we certainly regret any inconvenience this may cause, we are unable to cancel your reservation due to the terms originally agreed to at the time of booking. Also and due to a sold out situation during the dates of your booking, we were unable to accommodate your request without any charges. If rooms are available for your travel date, we will always offer the option of booking either restrictive (with cancellation/prepayment requirements) or non-restrictive (can be changed and cancelled without penalty) rates. This will allow you more flexibility in making your specific travel arrangements. For example: if you are certain about your travel plans, the restricted rate will be a consideration, whereas if your travel plans are less definite the unrestricted rate may better meet your needs.

We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns. We have reviewed your reservation and found it was booked at a restricted rate type, with a cancellation fee and/or full pre-payment requirement. These restrictions allow us to offer discounted rates that would otherwise be unavailable. While we certainly regret any inconvenience this may cause, we are unable to cancel your reservation due to the terms originally agreed to at the time of booking. If rooms are available for your travel date, we will always offer the option of booking either restrictive (with cancellation/prepayment requirements) or non-restrictive (can be changed and cancelled without penalty) rates. This will allow you more flexibility in making your specific travel arrangements. For example: if you are certain about your travel plans, the restricted rate will be a consideration, whereas if your travel plans are less definite the unrestricted rate may better meet your needs.
