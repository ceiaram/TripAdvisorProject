The bathroom had one single hook. The water pressure in the shower was quite weak. - The mini fridge was modern and cool-looking. - Melissa and Irwin at the front desk were very helpful. However, the breakfast menu was extremely limited, and the service was rather unpleasant. - As Titanium members, we were offered a voucher instead of free breakfast. Since the breakfast was so weak, we tried to redeem for the shop items, but it proved to be quite impossible because none of them had any price tag. We were told to bring the item we wanted to the front desk to check for its price. Strange!!!",June 2022,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,154

Unfortunately I was already cutting it close for time so the front desk agent offered me points instead. I never received these points. I have called 1-2 times a week since my stay and I am typically met with attitude and a promise of points or a call back both of which never happen.

There are lots of other hotels in the area which are very nice and less expensive, so if they try to gouge you, as they tried with me a couple of times, it is best to tell them you are going elsewhere.

Our check in with Sarah was quick and pleasant, she seemed ready to offer suggestions or answer questions, but we just wanted to start exploring the hotel and the surrounding activities.

7 helpful votes,17 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice but...Different,"This is a lovely new property that is trying a very hard to be European with the modular furniture, small rooms and layout. Everything is within arm or leg’s reach from the bed. EVERYTHING. Seriously, I could jump from the shower to the bed without touching the floor. it hard for me to recommend this for a couple.  When you enter the room (as with many non-US hotels) you have to insert the key into the wall unit for the electricity to work. Not a problem, unless you check in at 9 PM, in the dark. I almost dropped my phone and nearly slammed my hand in the very heavy door fumbling for my phone’s flashlight while trying to wrangle my baggage in the dark.   As I said, the rooms are small and have an interesting set up.

I  hope next time you might enjoy one of our standard king rooms that has a bathroom area that is separated from the bedroom space. It would be great to compare the two and see which one you prefer.

I've heard some great things about the hotel since the day that it opened and I have to say: I was quite impressed! Upon entering the building, I was warmly greeted by a well-groomed desk clerk named Devin who made my day by making me feel so welcomed.  He was quite pleasant and welcoming.  The first thing that grabbed my attention was the bar which had an inviting ambiance.  The lobby itself is quite large and has a spectacular interior design.  The seating, although chic, was pleasant and comfortable.  I was greeted by a few members of the staff, all of whom were friendly and professional.
