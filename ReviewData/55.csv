Breakfast doesn't have too many options and we ended up eating at Starbucks. For the price and distance to park it's a great stay. Our main complaints was that one not a big deal but the safe didn't work and was broken and there was no turn down service. The biggest caution is to ask for a room not facing the highway since it's very loud at night.

The good: the room was reasonably comfy, clean, with typical amenities. Reasonably quiet.  The bad: had a reservation and arrived for check in at 5 pm. Exhausted and needed to work before dinner. No rooms available (?!) and had to wait. The lobby is small, cold and uncomfortable, nowhere to sit with phone plugged in. Restaurant closed on Monday. While I waited they checked 2 people in ahead of me. Annoying but whatever they finally check me in. I go To room on 3rd floor and oh great neither room key works &$@#.

They do have transportation but there is a charge for it. Nothing special about the hotel itself but it was sufficient for what we needed. My only real complaint was they seemed to be hoarding the towels. We checked in and had 3 in the bathroom. The next day I asked the front desk for more towels. I requested 6 because my daughter and I each use 2 and then my husband and son needed 1 as well. I was told they could only give me 4 “since that’s all that’s supposed to be in each room” implying that we had too many people in our room. I was stunned.

The rooms are average and even with IHG Platinum status we were not elegible for an upgrade. The price-value relation is below par. What we found really inconvenient was the lack of having the breakfast included (as is the case of the 1411), as it adds to your overall expenses and time to actually get into the parks.

17 helpful votes,33 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice Hotel in Anaheim,I spent 2 nights at this Holiday Inn and was really happy with it. Check in was super easy and quick and parking was a breeze (& free!). The room was really nice and clean. There were lots of power outlets right next to the bed which was super handy for phones and iPads etc. The beds themselves were comfy and having a fridge and microwave allowed us to make some dinner instead of eating take out which was great.  The only fault was the airconditioning. It kept the room cool enough but was super noisy and seemed to violently cut in and out really noisily. And because it was right next to the bed it was enough to disturb your sleep or at least prevent you from getting to sleep. It may have just been an issue with the room I was in though but that's the only reason I gave this,October 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,262,55

All the staff we came across were friendly, polite, and happy to answer our many questions about taxis etc.   Close to Disney, we took the ART bus. $5 return seems liked great value for money.

There wasn't a breakfast buffet on offer, but at $10 I didn't think it was worth the money anyway and as far as we were concerned it didn't really matter where the hotel was in the ""resort"" because the resort was virtually non-existent.

LA has constant heavy traffic which means that you can not relax at the pool or open your window at night. Hotel is away from restaurants or any form of tourist attraction. 2.Air Conditioning is very noisy - far too noisy to have on! We have stayed in a lot of hotels in USA and have never heard anything like it!!
