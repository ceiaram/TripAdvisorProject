The outside of the suite had two barbeques, a lot of seating, and a fire pit.  The area was safe, quiet, and a 15 min walk to Disneyland.

The rooms were cleaner than past experiences.  The front desk staff were worse than normal.  When we checked in they were overwhelmed with people trying to check in and rooms weren't ready.

One unique quality that many of our guests love, is the condo-style layout of our hotel. This results in our second floor rooms to have stair-access only.  I am sorry to hear that you did not receive assistance with your luggage. While we do not have bell service, we are happy to send staff members to assist with luggage.   I apologize once again for your recent visit, and I hope you grant us the opportunity to welcome you back.

This hotel doesn't resemble any Residence Inn I've ever stayed in because its not clean, stained, torn flooring, everything needs new paint or repairs. The basketball court has ripped netting, volleyball net is torn, pool is scary filthy (including the pool furniture). All very simple and not very expensive repairs that just are not getting done?!

I thank you for bringing to our attention what you view as necessary changes that need to be made. We appreciate your feedback and will take your words into consideration.    As you mentioned, our hotel gets very busy; this makes it more difficult to provide early check-ins. We do our best however, to accommodate early check-ins as best as we can. Some days are busier than others, so the amount of early check-ins we are able to grant correlates with how busy our hotel is.   I would appreciate if you would contact me with more information regarding what you witnessed with our employees. I can assure you that this is the first time anything like this has been brought to our attention.  We have not encountered employees drinking coffee poolside, and we have yet to see the housekeepers bring their children to work, however we will most definitely look into it. The front desk has a strict policy when it comes to loaning out equipment for the sports court. Guests are required to provide a room number and last name in order to use any of our sporting equipment.    I am sorry for all of the housekeeping issues you encountered during your stay. I will make sure to address these issues with our Rooms Division Manager so he can take appropriate action as far as re-training housekeeping staff in the necessary areas.   You mentioned a 4 hour delay in check-in time, meaning that you were unable to get your room until 8pm. Since our housekeeping staff leaves at 5:30pm, I am puzzled as to why this was the case.

I appreciate that you came down to speak with me to make us aware of the noise issue you experienced with guests at the pool. I assured you that I would have our night auditor keep a close eye out for the noise level to make sure that your sleep would not get disrupted again. As we discussed, our pool is open 24 hours with quiet hours from 9pm to 9am. We give one verbal warning, and then will ask guests who do not contend with our quiet hours to leave the pool area. During our conversation, the gentleman I spoke with declined the offer to move to a quieter area of the hotel. Since it is difficult for us to eliminate all noise and guests have varying sound sensitivities, we found that the most effective solution in this case would be room relocation.  We encourage our guests to make our staff aware of any discomforts they experience during their stay so that we can take immediate action. When you and I spoke, there are many items mentioned in this review that were not discussed in person. I wish we would have had the full description of your stay so that we could have the opportunity to solve the many details that comprised the overall negative impression you perceived of our hotel.

I will be honest: at first it was very difficult, from a hotelier’s perspective, to view the photographs you presented & to read your story because you cut to the heart of what we love to do. We were all a bit embarrassed & shocked; we really thought our procedural eyes were sharp and alert! We are truly sorry that we fell short of your expectations and I assure you that we are taking steps to correct what is in our immediate power to correct. We have printed out your review and have been using it as a detailed guide since the review was published. These are the changes that we have made (and are undergoing), based on your feedback. Again, thank you for helping us improve what we offer our guests.   Over the weekend, we have had two all-staff housekeeping meetings to view your photographs & revisit our procedures. In addition to our standard cleaning measures, we are working out a special-projects schedule to rotate deep-cleaning projects more often into our daily routine. The cleaning materials & products we use are being tested (and new items brought in) to see which are more effective.   Because of the nature of our Disney leisure/vacation market, it is difficult to predict exactly when each family will be out of their room to provide housekeeping service, so we can be inconsistent. We have tried to set up a routine, but as you know when you’re on vacation – sometimes guests sleep in, sometimes they don’t, etc. If any of our guests would like to set up specific service times, please contact our front desk. Our regular, full-housekeeping service hours are from 9:00am – 4:00pm daily, unless there are extenuating circumstances.   Thank you for providing your specific room number in response to my email. Today, we replaced the showerhead, kitchen wood trim, & the re-caulked the bathroom door frame. Discussions are currently under way to replace the carpet in the bathroom area of your suite with linoleum or tile. Our team went in & you’re right – it does make more sense.   The sheer volume of guests that stay at our popular hotel can be overwhelming on our furniture & hotel items. The good news is twofold: 1) We regularly touch up & maintain what we have to keep it up as best as we can, and 2) We are up for a renovation!! The specific details (dates and what will be affected) are being worked out by our upper management team, but it looks as though we should have one by early 2014.    On a lighter note - it turns out that the ladder you photographed outside your window was used to retrieve a child’s toy from the rooftop of your building. While our Engineering Hero Of The Day was busy rescuing the item, he received a second call to assist another guest and accidentally abandoned the ladder in his rush to help. Please accept our apologies for the oversight - we do not typically leave ladders against our guest’s windows; it is certainly not a standard procedure! However, we do feel a bit better knowing the oversight was in exchange for stopping a wailing child's alligator tears (and the frantic parent’s need to buy headache medicine!).   ;)    Thank you again for your feedback and for giving us an opportunity to learn & grow.

I would like to take this opportunity to address some of your comments. I hope my points will help bring clarity to any unanswered questions you may have.   Lost and Found Procedures: In regards to your missing phone, I assure you we have a very strict Lost and Found procedure in place. Any items left in a room are to be turned into our Front Desk, where they are logged in our Lost and Found book and then stored in our secured storage. In some situations, items that are not logged as “found” on the date of inquiry may be logged under later dates. It may be helpful to give us a follow up call to see if your phone has been discovered since your original call.  Pest Control Schedule: Due to the fact that every one of our suites opens up to the exterior of the property, it leaves us more susceptible to pests than enclosed hotels. This being the case, pest control is a very important part of our regimen. We have a professional pest control company service our entire property every two weeks in order to keep our rooms pest free. We have assigned the suite you stayed in to a deep cleaning service in order to address any further pest issues.  Smoke-Free Hotel Policy: In 2006, Marriott instituted the Marriott Smoke-free Hotel Policy. This policy designates specific smoking areas on the property that are far enough from rooms that it will prevent smoke from tracking into the suites. These areas have ash trays and trash cans that are to be used for disposing of all smoking materials. Unfortunately, in your scenario, the remnants of the cigarettes were taken back into the room, which caused a strong smoke smell to saturate the suite. Seeing as though the room could not be rented due to the irreparable damages from the smoke, we applied the smoking fee.  I hope this helped address any confusion there may be about our policies and procedures. Please feel free to contact me or any of our management team members with further questions or comments.  Sincerely,  Vanessa Sah Sales Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,827,45

We offer breakfast from 6:30-9:30 am on the weekdays and 7-10 am on the weekends. Guests are also welcome to bring their breakfast back up to their rooms so they can continue to get ready for their day, and avoid some of the breakfast traffic.

I appreciate you taking the time to list some of the likes and dislikes of your stay. With that being said, I would like to take this time to address some of the dislikes that you mentioned:  •	Distance to Disney:  Our property is about a short 10-15 minute walk to the park which is equivalent to a half of a mile. We understand that the walk can be tiring after a long day at the park which is why the city of Anaheim offers shuttle transportation that runs daily at a small fee of $5 for adults and $2 for children ages 3-9 years old.   •	Property: Because our hotel is over 30 years old it is clear that the property has experienced its share of wear and tear. That being said, our preventative maintenance team is taking the time to treat rooms that are beginning to show their age. We are currently working on ways to improving our property for the sake of the hotel and our guests. •	WIFI: The complimentary WIFI that we offer is a secure network that is called Ethostream. We recently switched networks from an open line which was called Residence Inn to a secured network which is now Ethostream. Often times guest get the networks mistaken which causes the mix-up in connections.  Rest assured that I will notify my team to be more clear on which networks to connect to in the future.

I also appreciate the fact that you took the time to write what you felt the pros and cons of our hotel were. I would like to address some of the topics you mentioned, that you felt negatively impacted the hotel:  •	Distance to Disney: You are correct in mentioning that we are a half of a mile to Disneyland which is equivalent to a short 10-15 minute walk. I understand that after walking around all day at the park the walk back does get tiring. This is why the city of Anaheim provides the ART shuttle which is an all day pass for a small fee of $5 per person and children 3-9 are $2.  •	Rooms: I apologize that the room had poor ventilation. I have shared this information with my chief engineer and we will find a resolution for this issue. I am aware that our property is showing its age and we are currently working to making the appropriate steps to improve this.  •	Coffee: I am sorry you didn’t find our coffee was very good. We have a couple of small coffee shops including Starbucks within a mile radius of our hotel for other options.   I hope that some of the topics I touched on helped make things a bit clearer. If you still have any questions or concerns feel free to contact me personally at 714) 782-0047 or at krosales@rimhospitality.com.

From what you have written, I can tell that you and your family enjoyed a very great time while visiting the Anaheim Resort area. One important thing that families look for when traveling is budgeting expenses. I understand how important it is to try to save as much money as possible to be able to enjoy it on other activities. An example that you mentioned is our complimentary full hot buffet breakfast, this can easily save a family over $50 a day.  Aside from saving money, you can also save much time and energy with the help of the Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle. The ART shuttle is a fee based shuttle that transports guests from the local hotels to Disneyland on an all day pass. This day pass is a small fee of $5 for adults and $2 for children ages 3-9 years old. This can be very helpful if the children want to take a nap during the day or to return to the property to enjoy one of our evening social hours.   I lastly want to apologize for the debris around your room. We do our tree trimming about once every three months and our landscapers take extreme precautions when it comes to the safety of our guests by cone placement within 15 feet of vehicles and rooms.

This amenity is not only delicious, it can end up saving guests a great deal of money. 2) Our 25 exterior buildings allow for guests to have the perfect amount of privacy. 3) Due to the fact that we are located in the heart of Anaheim, there are plenty of attractions to stay occupied aside from the shopping and dining selections. To name a few: Angel Stadium, the Honda Center, the Anaheim Convention Center and of course Disneyland.  I hope that you will still continue to keep our hotel in mind for any future visits.

For example, our engineers are currently in the process of addressing the safety issue in regards to the open outlets.  In regards to the issue of finding bugs in your room, let me be the first to say that I understand how dismayed you must have felt for this situation to take place. I would like to point out that this issue is not something that we come across regularly and we take this matter extremely seriously. I have been informed by the Front Office Manager, Roger Rodriguez, that you have already contacted us in regards to this issue and we are taking the steps to make things right. As for future Trip Advisor users who are concerned about this matter, please know that when this situation does occur we immediately put the room out of order, from there we have a specialized crew come and treat the room. Once the room has been treated, the room is kept out of order for at least two weeks before another inspection is undergone. All linen and curtains are thrown away and there is a full inspection of the room by our staff before the room is put back into service.   Although receiving reviews by guests who are disappointed is not what we desire, we understand that when matters like this are brought to our attention, it will allow us to improve for the future.

We definitely appreciate hearing our guest’s perspective on what they loved about our hotel, and what areas we can improve in. I would like to touch on some of the points that you mentioned about our amenities:  •	Parking: Due to the fact that our property was built almost 30 years ago, the setup of our parking structure is very different as opposed to the standard parking garages. Many guests find it a lot more convenient because there is parking directly in front of the majority of our buildings. Also, because our hotel is one of the few properties that offer complimentary parking, it is an added bonus!  •	Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) Shuttle: The city of Anaheim’s shuttle transportation is used throughout the Anaheim Resort area. This shuttle transports guests to not only Disney, but also other large attractions in the local area (Angel’s Stadium, The Honda Center, and Outlets of Orange). Though they are scheduled to run approximately every 20 minutes on the hour, it is very possible that due to the summer schedule the trams could have been delayed. In these circumstances we encourage guests to inform us so that we could contact the transit dispatch as soon as possible to send backup.  •	Distance: You are absolutely correct in stating that after a long day at Disney it can be very tiring walking back from Disney. The great part about the quick 10-15 minute walk to the park is that there is the option to take the shuttle bus back and forth without having to deal with the chaos of the main Disney area.

The pool was just perfect, the basketball court was a nice addition, and the pickup for the ART bus system was absolutely a life saver, right on the property and right on time.

I hope that your daughters enjoyed a very magical birthday, I am so happy that they liked the cake. My team has a great reputation for going above and beyond guest expectations. One of our included amenities that guests also really love is the complimentary social hours on Mondays, Wednesdays and every other Fridays. Wednesdays are popular for guests because it is more of a dinner. Our staff grills hot dogs and hamburgers and serves them in the gatehouse with chips, salad and potato salad.   The grocery shopping service has really been very resourceful for our guests. Not only is the service complimentary but we will also put the groceries in your room by the time you come back from long day at Disneyland.  I understand how frustrating it must have been to hear the people above you. I am sorry that we were not able to accommodate you into a room that best suited your needs. I highly recommend requesting a second floor the next time we see you in the future.

On behalf of the hotel, we would like to apologize for your experience at our property. I am aware that our property has experienced much stress over the years due to the continuous flow of families that visit.  Our property has been holding up strong for the past 25 years and every opportunity we get to update, we always take advantage. Though this may be the case, because our property is in high demand we get very few opportunities to do so. I will most definitely make these concerns aware to my General Manager so that we can work on ideas to improve.   In regards to breakfast, you are correct in stating that our management staff rotates regulating the podium in the mornings. We do this for a few reasons: to assist the breakfast staff during morning rushes, helping staff in bussing tables and to regulate who enters the breakfast area.  Unfortunately, some surrounding hotels have become aware of Residence Inn’s complimentary breakfast buffet and we feel that it is unfair to our paying guests. Although asking for guest information is not our ideal method, it is in our best interest to make all things fair for our guests.

We had our small dog with us, and found it to be a very dog-friendly hotel (after paying the $100 pet fee).  We were in a studio which was the perfect size for the two of us plus the dog.

This is definitely the perfect place to stay if you plan on bringing your four legged friends. Thank you for mentioning the fact that we charge a flat $100 pet fee, I will also add that it is for a maximum of 2 pets. The benefit for our pet lovers is that they are welcome to leave the pets in the room while they are able to enjoy a long day at Disney.

Let me begin by expressing my apologies for the state of your room upon entering. I have, in fact, brought every single one of these issues to my room’s division’s manager. It is not typical of our housekeeping team to exemplify cleaning patterns such as this. Because we have so many families that come and stay with us mainly for Disneyland, we hold a high standard to our level of cleanliness. This is most definitely a mistake on our part, and our team is working together to makes sure that we prevent this from happening in the future.

Cleaning Service: I am sorry that your room was not serviced at the time you needed it.

Started off with great news that we were being upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite from a studio suite.  Front desk staff were friendly and efficient.  The room was clean, and featured the typical kitchen area, standard sofa bed, and bedroom with 2 full beds.  Both the main room and the bedroom had flat panel TVs with the standard choice of local and cable channels.  The bathtub and toilet were in a room separate from the sink area which helps to make things go faster in the morning when the family was getting up and all getting ready at the same time.

Considering you came with your family, I am most positive that our amenities were a huge factor when choosing our hotel. The complementary breakfast buffet is one of the popular amenities that guests enjoy while staying with us. As you mentioned, because of the many families that stay with us, breakfast can get very busy. However, guests have the ability to enjoy breakfast in the scenic outside patio, in the pool area or perhaps the most convenient option is for guests to take food back to the room.   After such a long day at Disney, it is common for little ones to not want to have to walk back to the hotel, or walk in general. The ART shuttle has made it so much more convenient for after such an exhausting day. With just a small fee of $4 for adults and $1 for children, the all day pass can bring you back and forth every 20 minutes on top of the hour. I would agree with you when saying “Residence Inn Maingate provides excellent value”. With parking, WIFI, grocery shopping service, and breakfast buffet all included, you are able to save money towards leisure activities.

Guest feedback is extremely important to us because it allows us to make room for improvement. Being that, I wanted to touch on a few of the topics you discussed above:  1.	Room Location: It is true that our property is not located along any main roads. However, it is common that guests who are more sensitive to noise than others, request quieter areas. I am sure that my front desk staff had more room locations to offer, however, because your arrival was a little bit earlier than check in time (4pm) it is possible that housekeeping had not begun the rounds yet.   2.	Grocery Shopping Service: It’s great to hear that you found the grocery shopping service to be convenient for you. I am sorry that it was not clear which store we do the shopping at. For the future, we do our grocery shopping at Albertson’s which is a general grocery store. You have the option to note any specific brands of food you like; otherwise we will purchase a generic brand. The charges will be put on your bill with no additional fees, we would be more than happy to provide a copy of the bill if there are any concerns. I also suggest for future guests to check out the Albertson’s grocery store website, as there are listings of food and prices.  3.	Kitchen supplies: Our fully equipped kitchenettes come stocked with 1 small sauce pan, 1 medium sauce pan, 1 large pot, 1 skillet, all with lids. There is also a strainer, measuring cups and spoons and storage bowls with lids. Aside from this there is a full refrigerator, stove/oven, microwave, toaster and all the utensils!   Again, I wanted to bring these topics to surface for the convenience of future guests and for your future reference.

This means that you don’t have to leave the park early in order to ensure a guaranteed ride back “home”.

For many guests, the full kitchen, buffet breakfast and the proximity (half mile) to Disneyland are just a few reasons why they enjoy our hotel.

The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle bus is an excellent system that is both helpful and reliable. The shuttle runs conveniently every 20 minutes on the hour on our property at a minimal fee of $4 for adults and $1 for children ages 3-9 years. Another great perk about the shuttle is that each route takes you to a different location. So instead of renting a vehicle you can use the ART shuttle to transport you to other locations such as Target, restaurants, Knott’s Berry Farm and even an outdoor outlet mall.   I would lastly like to note that if you encounter a future conflict with your luggage we do offer luggage racks to make storage more convenient.

I am glad that you recognize the proper maintenance of our hotel after all these years. The Penthouse bi-level loft is a very spacious room for large families. The suite has two queen size beds in the downstairs bedroom and a king bed in the loft area, with two restrooms, a full kitchen and living room with a sofa sleeper. Due to the fact that the loft is an open area, I generally recommend parents reside upstairs while children sleep downstairs. We do offer safety gates for families with smaller children also.   The Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) Shuttle is a fee based service provided by the city of Anaheim. They run according to the park hours, starting 30 minutes before the park opens and stopping 30 minutes after the park closes. It is very convenienct after a long day at the park, however, the quick 10-15 minute walk is also very suitable.  “Suite” Regards,  Kimberly Rosales Sales Associate",none,none,none,none,none,none,990,45

For guests who are sensitive to noise, I strongly suggest guests to request a quiet area on the second story. •	Breakfast: Because breakfast is very popular, there is generally a rush between 8:30-9:30am. There is always the option of outdoor seating or taking your breakfast back up to the room. •	Staff: As a result of the breakfast popularity, the managers (including myself) take turns monitoring crowds and assisting the breakfast staff. The breakfast staff is also very diligent about maintaining the area.  •	Pool: I apologize for the amount of chlorine was in the pool. We always appreciate when guests give us their feedback so that we are able to take care of the issue promptly.

The Penthouse bi-level loft suite is the most popular suite amongst our four room types. As you mentioned, the suite is definitely a “fun” room and suitable for families of up to eight. I apologize that you didn’t have as much privacy in the loft suite. What I highly recommend for any future guests wanting more privacy is considering our Two Bedroom suite. Not only does this suite provide that privacy of two separate bedrooms (with doors), but it also is larger in square footage and is located only on the first floor. Due to the fact that we only have seven of these room types on property, I suggest looking into these rooms in advance because they do sell fast.   A tip I like to offer guests is which transportation method works best for them. If you are an annual pass holder and have parking included, then I suggest you take advantage of it. I typically do not recommend parking at Disney only because the structure is located on the other side of the park, the wait for the shuttle to transport you to the park, and walking from Downtown Disney (where it drops off) to the turnstiles can be an inconvenience. What I recommend is the quick 10-15 minute walk from our property to Disney. If parents are concerned about the walk home there is also the Anaheim Resort Transit which is a convenient shuttle that is just a small fee of $4 for adults and $1 for children 3-9. The shuttle picks up on our property every 20 minutes on the top of the hour and runs according to the park hours.   Every single review I receive is so beneficial to our hotel because it either informs us on what guests love, or notifies us on what we need to work on. With that being said, I have noted all of the concerns you have mentioned so that the necessary action can be taken.

To add to the few that you mentioned there’s also California Pizza Kitchen, Roy’s Hawaiian Fusion, Bar Louie, Johnny Rockets and Fire & Ice which are all in walking distance to our property.

We take every/all guest feedback very seriously. Many families enjoy the Penthouse suite bi-level loft for the reason that it is large enough to fit a family of eight.

Since you are a TripAdvisor user, I am sure you have taken the time to read our previous reviews and know that mediocre stays are very rare. With that being said, I would like to simply touch on some of the issues you’ve mentioned:    •	Rooms: I do realize that because we have so many families visit us throughout the year that our furniture experiences plenty of ware and tare. Because of this, our preventative maintenance team works on these rooms to ensure the little things are recognized and fixed.  •	Space: An average hotel room is about 300 sq ft. Our hotel offers rooms from as small as 450 sq ft. to as large as 800 sq ft. If more space is what you generally prefer, than I suggest looking into our larger suites (Penthouse/Two bedroom).  •	Replenished items: Depending on what type of suite you book, there is an expected amount of guests that are in the room. So, if there are more items needed, it is best that the desk is contacted so we can note that a certain amount requested is replenished daily.   I understand that moving rooms can be a bit of a difficulty. Nonetheless, we would prefer to be informed of issues as soon as possible so we have the opportunity to fix them. My goal was to touch up on your points and at the same time inform our future TripAdvisor guests of alternatives. I also want to thank you for your compliments on our breakfast and kitchenettes.

Our team strives to make every guests stay memorable. With that being said, it is great that the front desk was able to get you settled into a room earlier than the regular check-in time (4pm). Occasionally, there are times where we do have rooms available to check-in to and we are more than happy to get guests accommodated as conveniently as possible, however, this is not always a guarantee.

Never the less, we should have done a better job providing you with the information you needed. •	Property Layout: Due to the fact that we are a generation one Residence Inn, there is only stair access to the top floor rooms. I apologize this was not made clear to you prior to sending you to your suite. •	Tables: We do not have an additional table/desk in the Studio Suite due to the fire code restriction on the room.

Our Penthouse suites have a loft area upstairs which, as you stated, is completely open to the downstairs area. The great part about this room is that if one was looking for privacy, the downstairs room with the French doors is separate from the living room and loft area.

Especially if families are looking on doing more than just Disneyland (Universal Studios, Knott’s Berry Farm, and Sea World) it can be very convenient and cost efficient. However, if renting a car isn’t what you prefer, a cheaper way of transportation other than a cab would be Super Shuttle.

One reason we love TripAdvisor is because it allows the guest to express their familiarity with our hotel. With that being said, I would like to take this time to address the topics you have brought up about our hotel:  1.	Distance: Being that we are exactly 0.5 miles away from Disneyland the short walk can be relative for different guests. We are the closest Residence Inn to Disney which is why we are titled Maingate. For any TripAdvisors wondering about our proximity I would be more than happy to send area maps so there is a better understanding of our distance.  2.	Penthouse Suite: Our Penthouse Suites are one of the biggest suites on property. Average hotel rooms are about 450 sq ft. where our Penthouses are 700 sq ft. so there is generally always plenty of room. For travelers with young kids I like to suggest baby gates (provided upon request) because of the upstairs loft area. I personally like the Two Bedroom Suite for parents with children because it also gives you a bit more privacy.  3.	Interior: My team always works proactively to maintain the quality of our suites. In fact, our engineering team goes through vacant rooms daily to work on preventative maintenance. We understand the importance of meeting the demands of our guests.  4.	The Staff: I am sorry that your experience was not up to our standards. As you can see by other TripAdvisor reviews, our staff is one of the main reasons why they return so there should be no exceptions. Our weekly Marriott quality assurance scores show that our staff has an above average rating; I will make sure my staff is reminded of this as it should be applied to all guests.

It’s great to read that your stay was accommodating for your family. I have noticed that we have been receiving a lot of positive feedback to the replacement of our beds since last year. It is very important to get a good night’s rest when visiting Disneyland.   You are absolutely correct in stating that the walk can be tiring after a long day at Disney. Because of this, the city of Anaheim has assisted in offering a fee based shuttle ($4-Adults, $1-Children) that runs continuously throughout the day. I also am aware that for some guests the walk is much more difficult than it is for others who find the half-mile walk a bit more convenient. I like the fact that we are not along the main road so it is safer yet still easily accessible to walk.   I hope that with my suggestions it will change your mind about returning.

In regards to breakfast, I would like to assure you that the breakfast staff cooks the meats thoroughly. A staff member cooks the assigned meat the day before in the oven, whether it is bacon, sausage or ham, to ensure that it is not under cooked.

We stayed at the Residence Inn in a penthouse suite. This was our second time staying at the Residence Inn, and overall it was really good. The walk to Disney was about 15 minutes at a leisurely pace. But there is also a shuttle (at a cost) that will take you to and from Disney. The hotel is across the street for the Garden Walk, which is an outdoor mall. We didn't really spend any time shopping there, but we often had dinner at the many restaurants there. We also discovered that most, if not all, of the restaurants have take-out. This came in handy after a long day at Disney with the kids.  As for the hotel. We stayed in the penthouse.

I understand how much location is a necessity when it comes to vacationing.  Luckily, our hotel is conveniently located in the midst of Disneyland, restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, P.F Changs, CPK, Bubba Gump etc.), shopping and entertainment.  The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle is a huge help for traveling in the Anaheim Resort area. Because there are 17 different routes that go everywhere from The Honda Center to The Block at Orange it is one way of saving money.   There are benefits in both the Two-bedroom and the Penthouse that each guest has a preference for. Various guests enjoy the fact that the Penthouse has a king size bed upstairs; while the other two queens are in the separate bedroom below. On the other hand, several guests like the privacy of the Two-Bedroom suite. Being that there are two separate bedrooms that close, it is easier for larger families to stay in one room.

The downstairs room is enclosed by French doors. Aside from that, you have the living room area where the sofa bed is, and a full kitchen area.

The king bed and the second bathroom are located in the upstairs loft (which is an open area).

I appreciate the great feedback you gave throughout your review.   For the benefit of our future guests, I would like to add some additional information to the comments you made:  •	We are a half of a mile (10-15 minute walk) to Disneyland’s main entrance.  •	Our complimentary hot buffet breakfast is a favorite for our guests. With that said, it can get a bit crowded. The busiest hours are between 8:30-9:30am. In order to help keep the crowds down we offer additional seating areas(indoor and outdoor), and we also allow guests to take food back to their room. •	Since the hotel’s opening in 1988 we have undergone renovations annually. We are always looking for ways we can improve our product, so we very much appreciate your feedback. Our latest update is the addition of new coffee and end tables. We are also currently reupholstering our furniture. •	The Disney Desk is most definitely a huge benefit to the hotel when it comes to selling ART Shuttle Passes, Disneyland tickets and, as you purchased, the Southern California CityPass.  It so great to know that the amenities and services we offer allowed you to enjoy your stay.   Again, I appreciate such genuine feedback.

With that said, I would like to take this opportunity to comment on some of your issues. By doing so, I do not mean to discredit your points, but rather hope to inform future guests of possible solutions to these issues:  •	Distance to Disneyland: Although our hotel is located only a half-mile from the park, I do understand why the walk may become tiring. This being the case, we often refer guests to utilize the Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle, which picks up at our property every 20 minutes for a small fee (adults: $4, children: $1). •	Bedding: I’m sorry you found you r bedding to be less than comfortable. One thing I might suggest on your next visit to our hotel would be to request a mattress pad, which we will gladly place in your room at no cost. The pillow top mattress pads are over an inch think and provide added comfort so you can enjoy a good night’s rest. •	Carpet: With the summer rush just having ended, we know that our carpets are in need of some special attention. This being the case, I would like you to know that we are currently in the process of having the carpets washed in every one of our suites.  •	Noise: We ask guests who are more sensitive to noise to communicate their needs for a quieter suite.

With that said I would like to address some of the points you made:  • I’m sorry about the condition of your sofa sleeper. Our hotel has seen an extremely busy year, which means some “wear and tear”. This being the case, we have our engineering team going through as many unoccupied suites as they can on a daily basis working on preventative maintenance. This includes fixing any problems and replacing any items that are no longer in adequate condition.  • As for our breakfast menu, we work very hard to offer a variety of items that meet the needs and desires of all our guests. For this reason we offer healthy options such as whole wheat toast, low-fat yogurts, fresh fruit, oatmeal, sautéed vegetables, etc.  • As for the crowds at breakfast, the entire management team (myself included) has joined in the efforts to help make the breakfast experience more enjoyable for our guests. One way we have done this is by manning the host stand and helping our guests find available seating. We have also added more seating to exterior dining areas. Finally, we always encourage guests to take food back to their room if they would not like to wait for a table.

It comes with a king size bed in the upstairs loft, two queen size beds in the downstairs bedroom and a full size sofa sleeper in the living room.

I’m glad to hear that despite the issues you experienced with the noise you still enjoyed the hotel, service and the amenities. I would like to comment on your issues in an attempt to help future guests avoid having the same experience.  First, noise can be an issue with our pool and hot tub because they are fully heated and open 24 hours. In order to proactively address this issue we have designated a 10pm-7am “Quiet Time” rule. This rule states that guests are welcome to use the pool and hot tub after 10pm as long as they do not disturb other guests by causing excessive noise. The first complaint will result in a warning to all parties in the pool/hot tub area. Any additional complaints will result in an eviction of all parties causing the noise.  You also mentioned the sofa bed not being very comfortable. One way we can help with this issue is to send up a mattress pad to your room. We offer complimentary pillow top mattress pads for the sofa bed or for the queen beds in our suites upon request. We have heard from several guests that having the mattress pad on the sofa bed makes a notable difference in the quality of their sleep.

On top of that, we offer other great amenities such as a complimentary breakfast buffet and free grocery shopping. To top it all off, we are located only a half mile from Disneyland. The best part is that we offer all this along with personalized service. Our team really enjoys being able to help with special surprises, as you experienced first hand.

Eventhough it's walking distance you don't need to walk to Disneyland because they a shuttle services that picks you up from the parking lot and drops you off at the main entrance of Disneyland. Also, there's tones of restaurants around - Cheesecake Factory, Tony Romas, IHOP, etc. It's also close to the highway.   What I didn't like was a uncomfortable the beds were. The hotel room itself was good. It had a kitchen, I was able to shop for water, sodas, and have place to keep them cool.

As you mentioned, our hotel is walking distance from the Disneyland resort as well as many dining, shopping and entertainment options. I’m also glad to hear how much you enjoyed our amenities and service. Having a full size kitchen in all our suites, complimentary buffet breakfast, free parking and wifi are all tremendously valuable for anyone traveling to the Anaheim Resort Area.  I also want to touch on some of the issues you experienced while you were here. First, I apologize for the fact that you did not enjoy a good nights rest while you were at our hotel. But I am very glad to inform you that as of early this year we have replaced all of our hotel mattresses with brand new Simmons II plush Health Smart mattresses. Since the change, we have noticed a great response from our guests in regards to the quality of their sleep.  I also wanted to address the breakfast. I’m very sorry to hear that you did not get to enjoy our complimentary full buffet breakfast. This is by far one of our most popular amenities amongst our guests. Our breakfast tends to be busier in August because we usually have more families traveling to our hotel during the summer break. To help guests avoid issues with over-crowding, I recommend the following:  •	Come early. Our breakfast runs from 6:30am- 9:30am Mon-Fri and 7am-10am on the weekends. What we tend to see a lot of is families arriving during the last 45 minutes of the breakfast, so this is when we see the biggest crowds. •	Enjoy breakfast in your room. We always allow our guests to take food back to their room, so if you arrive and have a difficult time finding a table then you can feel free to take your breakfast and enjoy it in your room. This actually works quite well seeing as our suites come with a dining table and enough chairs for the family. Thank you again for taking the time to write about your stay. I hope you and your family will choose to stay with us the next time you are in the Anaheim Resort Area, so you can enjoy our brand new mattresses and complimentary buffet breakfast first hand.

I also want to thank you for the great feedback about our suites. I totally agree that our hotel is a perfect choice for families looking for spacious and comfy suites at a great value. 	I would like to add some comments about some of the points you made in order to help clarify information for readers. Our hotel is located a half mile from Disneyland’s main entrance. This usually makes for a 10-15 minute walk to the park for a family, but I understand why walking may be difficult for some. The fact that people visiting Disneyland easily walk over 5 miles a day while in the park alone means that the walk to and from the park might be a bit over the top, especially for families with small children. But many of our guests find the walk is very doable. Another option to walking to Disney is the Anaheim Resort Transit which picks up at our property every 20 minutes (nominal fee). 	I also wanted to mention an inside bit of information for Downtown Disney. As you mentioned, the first three hours are free, but it is also good to know that you can receive up to five hours free with the purchase of any item in Downtown Disney. This is perfect for families who might like to spend some time shopping, dining and even catching a movie at the AMC 12 theater in Downtown Disney. 	Thank you again for the great review.

I’m glad you found our hotel location and amenities to be so pleasant. But I would like to focus my reply on your comments about how you felt as a Marriott Rewards Elite member. I would like to start by apologizing for the less than satisfying experience you had as an Elite member. We definitely want to do everything we can to make sure that the loyalty of our rewards members is rewarded.  With that said, I think it is important that I clarify some of our benefits practices when it comes to Marriott Rewards members:  •	Upgrades: We offer a complimentary upgrade to the top two levels of Elite members (Gold and Platinum), but this upgrade is based on availability. This upgrade cannot be granted prior to the day of your arrival and is only good for upgrades from the Studio Suite to the One Bedroom Suite. Also, the upgrade must be available for the entire length of your stay.  •	Platinum Gift: We offer a complimentary item out of the market or an additional 250 Marriott Rewards points to your account. The one item market gift is a Marriott Global standard and has not been set by our properties management team.  •	Late Check Out: We offer a complimentary late check out for Elite members based on availability. I’m sorry that you were told that late check out was simply “not available”. We cannot always offer a check out as late as some Elite members would like, especially when we have a lot of guests arriving that day, but we should always be able to get you a little extra time in the room.  I’d also like to mention that I’m very sorry that you never received a response to your e-mal. Would you please do me the favor of contacting me directly and letting me know what e-mail you wrote to?

I would like you to know that I have discussed your review with our front desk team and we have reviewed our Marriott Rewards benefits practices with them as well.

We sincerely want to make every one of our guests happy, and take it very seriously when we fail to do so. Although I know we cannot go back and fix the way your stay went I would like to comment on some of your points in hopes of helping future guests.  •	In regards to the condition of our suites, our property has been open since 1988. Since opening, we have gone through several renovations, the most recent being earlier this year when we replaced all of our mattresses with brand new Health Smart, double-plush, mattresses. We are currently finishing up the replacement of our old dining sets with brand new china that is much more contemporary. But even with the renovations we know that there is still more work to be done. We are currently looking into options that will help us better meet the needs of our guests.  •	In regards to our breakfast, we always welcome our guests to talk to us about their preferences when it comes to food. If there are changes we can make, even to a personal order, we will do it. Just recently, we spoke to a guest who was allergic to the oil we use to cook our eggs. To help accommodate the guest we offered to cook a separate batch of eggs using ingredients that she could eat. This is just one example of how far our breakfast team is willing to go to make sure our guests enjoy their meals.  •	In regards to our pet-free suites, we do allow pets at our hotel, but 40 of our 200 suites are completely pet-free. In order to help ensure that guests with pet allergies are blocked into pet-free suites we strongly encourage guests to notify us of their allergies prior to their arrival. This enables our front desk to block guests with pet allergies into pet-free suites from the start.  Again, I want to mention that the comments I made above were not to contest the issues you had, but rather to help future guests to avoid having the same experience. As for your experience, I again deeply apologize. I would be more than happy to speak with you directly about your stay if you would like to contact me: 714-782-0046.

I picked this hotel due to all the great reviews AND because I loved the fact that the hotel rep would respond to each one! Let me tell you...it's NOT all hype! This is a great place to stay if you are doing Disneyland and especially if you have a large group. There were 7 of us: Myself and two daughters (ages 4 & 9) and my Auntie and her three daughters (ages 4, 10,&13).   Our flight arrived fairly early and so our room was not ready.  Ms. Betty held our luggage in a secure room while we all headed for the pool!  The weather was wonderful and the kids were excited to play in the pool.  There is a kiddie pool that's only like 1 1/2 ft, a hot tub, and a large pool that went from 3ft to 5ft.

I don’t just mean that based on how happy you were with your stay, but also in regards to how informative it is. You really did a great job of including great information for future travelers. Thank you!  I’m always happy to read that my responses on Trip Advisor are demonstrating our commitment to listen to our guests and improve our service based on what we learn. The above and beyond service you received from Mishelle, Betty and other team members is the product of constant improvements and sincere desire to see our guests happy.  Just to add some extra details to some of the comments you made:   •	Our pool, kiddie pool, and Jacuzzi are open 24 hours and fully heated. The pool is kept at a comfortable 80 degrees, the kiddie pool is kept at a cozy 90 degrees and the Jacuzzi is kept at relaxing 100 degrees.  •	The ART shuttle is an excellent option for families, especially if they area planning on taking a mid-day break from the park (which is a great game plan). The shuttle comes by the property every 20 minutes (20, 40 and the top of the hour). The fee is $4 for adults and $1 for kids ages 3-9.  •	Our complimentary evening BBQ buffet is held on Wednesday nights from 5pm-7pm. It includes hamburgers, hotdogs, chili, potato salad, green salad, chips and non-alcoholic beverages. Although the BBQ buffet is only held on Wednesday evenings, our guests are always welcome to use our BBQ area for their own pleasure seven days a week.

Fantastic location - walking distance to Disney, Garden Walk and all the great food chains- california Kitchen, Cheesecake factory etc. We arrived  early after a long flight from Sydney and they put us in a room straight away although check in was not until 4. It was a different room so our price was lowered. There are laundry facilities and a great way to start our holiday. The only negative was the breakfast- it was pretty ordinary, not too many healthy or fresh options, its so crowded it is hard to get a seat and stops at 9.30 on the dot.

This is one of the busiest seasons for us, which usually means that our breakfast can get crowded, but I assure you that the management team is working to come up with creative solutions for dealing with this issue. One of the current options that we offer our guests is to utilize the outdoor dining areas such as the pool side and the BBQ area.

The bakery did not have a soccer themed cake, but due to the advanced notice I was able to put in a special order in time to have it ready for your arrival.  I would also like to mention that everyone at the front desk truly enjoyed every interaction they had with you and your family.

The staff were friendly and helpful, they handed out free popsicles one afternoon at the pool. The breakfast was great and it was nice not to have to head out to a restaurant.

As much as I love reading reviews where people are totally blown away, I also enjoy reading reviews with information that can help us improve our product. Like any hotel, the longer our doors stay open, the more work we have to put into keeping our hotel up to the Marriott standard. For this reason, we have constructed a maintenance mini-swat team that is working every day to get into our rooms and fix every single issue they find. With 200 Suites, this is a lengthy process, but we know it is the best plan of action if we want encounter an issue before our guests do.  As for the “great extras”, I’m glad you loved the service and amenities we provided for you. We love doing little things like the popsicles by the pool for our guests. We always want to take the opportunity to go the extra mile when it comes to making our guests feel special. Other examples of this are us going out and getting a birthday cake for a guest who is celebrating their birthday at Disneyland, or perhaps having some flowers put in a room if we know the guest is celebrating an anniversary. Our front desk is always looking for important details (birthdays, anniversaries, etc) about our guests that we can use to make them feel EXTRA SPECIAL!

A single day pass is $4 adults and $1 for children, a 3 Day pass is $10 for adults and $2 for children, and the 5 Day pass is $16 for adults and $4 for children.

We all have a big responsibility to take care of our environment and we at the Residence Inn Anaheim Maingate have been making changes that have helped us do just that. The first change we made in this area was to put recycling receptacles throughout our property for our guests and staff to use.   As for the trash bags you saw with the plastic bottles and other recyclable items, I assure you that we do separate the recycling items from the regular trash at the end of the day. The trash bags outside the rooms are the bags containing the guest's trash. For the purpose of servicing all of our guests in a timely manner, we ask our housekeeping staff to wait until after all the rooms have been cleaned to divide the recyclable items from the rest of the trash. As for the kitchen person who through the large plastic bottle in the trash, I have taken this opportunity to discuss the importance of recycling with our kitchen team and made sure that they are all aware that recycling is everyone's responsibility.  As for our use of styrofoam and plastic at our breakfast, we always do our best to strictly use porcelain plates, glass cups and real silverware at our breakfast. Unfortunately, when our hotel is full, the high demand at our breakfast sometimes forces us to use plastic ware and styrofoam while we work to replenish our regular dining sets. If we did not do so, our guests would have to wait longer at breakfast.  Again, I want to thank you for helping us to improve our environmental awareness.

We sincerely value guest service at our property and never want any guest to walk away feeling the way you did. The issues you mentioned fall into the categories of guest service and room upkeep. These are two areas where our hotel has consistently excelled when it comes to Marriott's Quality inspections as well as our Guest Service Surveys and Trip Advisor Reviews. With that said, I know that we are not perfect and are just as capable of failing as any other hotel. To avoid that from happening, we encourage our guests to inform us of any issues they have while they are staying with us so that we can go about correcting the issue. I would love to speak with you directly about the issues you experienced so that I can learn how we can continue to grow in these areas. You may contact me by calling the hotel directly at (714) 533-3555 and asking for Ext. 210 (Roger Rodriguez). My goal is to listen to what you have to say and learn how we can improve.

I'm sorry that your vacation fell on the week we had downpour, but I'm glad you were still able to enjoy your trip. The Studio Suite is a great room for small families, but due to the extra bed and space the One Bedroom Suite can be a better choice. As for the sofa bed, one amenity we provide to help it be more comfortable is the pillow top mattress pad. We are happy to send a mattress pad to a guest's room upon request at no charge. The room transfer service is another service we provide to help our guests enjoy their vacation. If, at some point during their stay, a guest would like to move rooms, we will move their luggage for them once a new room is ready.

I really do appreciate how specific you were in your post. Reviews like yours makes our job of better meeting our guest's needs much easier. I'm very happy to hear that you enjoyed your suite as well as the rest of the property and amenities. The complimentary breakfast and grocery shopping service are two of our most popular services. I'm also very happy to hear that we were able to help you get a good night's rest by sending you the pillow top mattress pads. Most of our guests are unaware that we offer the mattress pads so I want to take this opportunity to put that news out there for our future guests. There is no fee for the mattress pads. All you have to do to get one is notify the front desk and we will send it up. With that said, I also must mention one very important bit of information. By the end of January, 2011 we will have brand new high quality double plush mattresses for all of our suites. We really think they are going to make a huge improvement on the quality of our guest's rest.  I would also like to quickly discuss some of your cons. Before I start, I want to apologize for the fact that we did not exceed your expectations in these areas. We really take guest satisfaction very seriously and I promise that we have discussed your review with our front desk team. Starting with the con about your check-in experience. Our regular check-in time is 4pm. If we have rooms ready earlier then we are more than happy to get guests into their rooms early, but this does not seem to have been the case in your situation. We definitely should have done a better job communicating that. As for the cancer warning sign, the sign has been posted due to the requirements of proposition 65. According to prop 65, any innkeeper that sells or serves food and or/beverages in their operations must post a warning about chemicals used that may have a connection with cancer causing agents. This includes every hotel in the Anaheim Resort Area. The chemicals in question fall under the following categories: Second hand tobacco smoke, construction, maintenance and cleaning chemicals, engine related exposures, and pest control/landscaping chemicals. As for your requests not being taken care of properly, that simply falls on our team failing to follow up with you. To avoid this from happening in the future, our front desk team is logging all requests and making sure to call the guests back within 30 minutes to make sure their request has been taken care of. Finally, in regards to the sofa mattress, the sofa mattresses will also be replaced by the end of January. Until then, we are recommending that our guests utilize the pillow top mattress pads.  Thank you again for your review. I hope that my response has helped with any questions or concerns you had about our hotel. I hope that you will consider staying with us again the next time you are in the Anaheim Resort Area.  Happy Holidays, Roger Rodriguez",none,none,none,none,none,none,1216,45

We planned on a day of relaxation and two days of Disneyland.  This hotel provided everything we needed.  The one bedroom suite was the right size for 4, and the full kitchen was nice and clean.  We had a lower level room near the street, however the street noise was not a problem.  The boys loved the in room Nintendo.  It was a perfect hotel to go to Disneyland from.  The full breakfast filled us up, so we didn't need to buy a lot of food at Disneyland.  The Anaheim shuttle was convenient.

I'm glad to hear that you were able to integrate some vacation into your business trip. It would've been a shame to have been so close to Disneyland and not have gone. I'm also glad to hear that you and your family enjoyed your stay so much. Having the extra space of a suite and the full kitchen makes traveling with a family much more comfortable. The complimentary buffet breakfast only adds to the experience. I agree that our hotel is perfect for families who plan on going to Disneyland. We are only a half mile from the theme park and, as you mentioned, guests can also ride the Anaheim Resort Transit ($4 a day for adults, $1 a day for kids) if they prefer to not do the 10 minute walk. Lastly, I want to say that I'm glad we were able to get your coats back to you in a timely manner. You were probably surprised to see how easy it was to forget something in your hotel room.

Our room was a little noisy at times but this was not a problem for us.  We walked to and from Disneyland twice each day and the walk felt safe and took no more than 15 minutes each way.

We always appreciate it when a guest will take the time to write about the wonderful experience they had at our hotel. Our team works very hard to give families, just like yours, the vacation they are hoping for. I'm glad to hear your family enjoyed our sports court as well as the 24 hour heated pool. These are just two of the many features that make our hotel perfect for families looking to have fun and relax. On top of having fun and relaxing, guests can enjoy a multitude of food options. From the free full buffet breakfast every morning to the dozens of restaurants within walking distance, guests will definately find something they'll enjoy. I'm not surprised you are a fan of the California Pizza Kitchen. They really do have amazing food. Personally, I can't find a place with better BBQ Chicken pizza. The Anaheim Garden Walk is full of great food options, and the best part is that they are right across the street. If a guest is looking for something with more of a Disney feel, then they can head over to Downtown Disney. It is full of great Disney eateries and is, as you mentioned, only a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Thank you again for taking the time to write about your experience.

We had a room on the far end of the hotel.  You could hear some noise from the highway, but it wasn't bothersome.

We",November 2010,none,none,"Dear eagleray,  Thank you very much for the wonderful review. I'm so happy that your first visit to Disneyland went so perfectly! The majority of our guests visit Disneyland during their stay so it really is great to have the Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle service at our hotel. For anyone who has not used the ART shuttle, it picks up from our property and heads to Disneyland every 20 minutes throughout the day. The fee to ride is $4 for the day for adults and $1 for the day for kids. The shuttle is perfect for families, as you experienced first hand. Another great feature for families, as you also mentioned in your review, is the playground. It's a perfect way to pass the time with small children when you are not at the park. On top of that, having the extra space in your room along with the full kitchen makes your time with us feel much more like home. One perk you don't get at home is the free buffet breakfast. Thank you for mentioning how hard our kitchen team works to make the breakfast so enjoyable for our guests. When you have 200 families coming up for breakfast, keeping things clean and organized as well as making sure food is hot and available is no easy task. But our team does a great job! As for your the trouble you had with housekeeping, I'm sorry that we did not do a better job communicating with you on how the cleaning schedule works. Our housekeeping staff works from 9am to 4pm. The order in which rooms will be cleaned is not determined until we know what rooms are available that day. This means that no room has a set cleaning time. With that said, we completely understand that families sometimes need to have a set cleaning time due to napping schedules, feeding times, etc. In order to meet our guests needs, we simply ask that if there is a specific time when you would prefer to be serviced that you notify the front desk. The desk will then communicate your request to the housekeeping department and we will make sure that your room is serviced at the time that is most convenient for you. Thank you again for your kind review. I look forward to your next visit to the Anaheim Resort Area.  Happy Holidays, Roge Rodriguez",none,none,none,none,none,none,1219,45

The food was hot and tasted fine.  Having the Disneyland kiosk inside of the hotel was a plus.  This hotel is close enough to Disneyland that you can walk.

The title is especially great! We work very hard to please our guests and we take a lot of pleasure in hearing about how wonderful your stay was. I'm glad to hear that we were able to block your two rooms beside one another. This is not always easy because we do not have adjoining rooms, but our front desk team always makes the effort to block families with multiple rooms as close as possible. As for the special gift that was left in your room prior to your arrival, you can again thank the front desk. Mishelle, the Front Desk Manager, and her team really enjoy creating special memories for our guests. I could not be more proud of how Mishelle responded to you leaving your phone charger in your suite. Having people on our team that will go the extra mile to serve our guests is part of what makes us stand out. I cannot say enough about our entire hotel team. I'm also glad to hear that you not only enjoyed our team, but our facilities as well. The heated 24 hour pool is a big plus for most families. I'm really happy to hear that your kids loved it so much. I want to especially thank you for mentioning our free grocery shopping service. So many of our guests are unaware of the fact that we will do your shopping for you. Like you said, it's as easy as writing up a list and dropping it off at the front desk by 9am. One thing I would like to add is that we also accept grocery lists prior to arrival. All you have to do is e-mail us your list before 9am on the day of your arrival and we will have the groceries in your room for you when you arrive. Thank you again for all of the wonderful comments and I really hope that we will have the pleasure of accomodating you and your family again on your next trip to Anaheim!",none,none,none,none,none,none,1234,45

This is my 5th trip to the park, and I have stayed at a different hotel each time, from expensive to cheap. This is also my first review as I am not one to complain very often. Here it goes-  We reserved a upstairs room as many reviewers had recommended, 2 1/2 months ahead of time. We ended up getting a downstair unit, not the end of the world for us, but we did request it way in advance. We e-mailed a small list of food items for them to stock our fridge with- bread packaged luch meat potato chips, cheese, juice. When we arrived we saw that we had no packaged lunch meat or chips. well it didnt kill us but we had planned to eat sandwiches at the park instead",October 2010,none,none,"Dear ReconThePlanet,       I want to start by thanking you for taking the time to write about your stay. I also want to apologize that it was not what you were hoping it would be. You being someone who has stayed in several hotels in the Anaheim Resort Area, I know you have expectations and I am sorry that we did not exceed them. My purpose in responding to your review today is only to help educate our future guests on options they have if they run into some of the issues you ran into.       I would like to start by mentioning that whenever a guest makes a request we do our best to accommodate that request. Unfortunately, the suite type you booked, the one bedroom suite, is only located on the first floor. We try very hard to make that clear to all of our reservations agents, but unfortunately they do sometimes fail to explain this to our guests prior to arrival.       As for the issue with the grocery list, there is always the possibility that a specified item may be out of stock. Items such as chips and lunch meat are not likely to be out of stock, but if a specific brand of lunch meat or chips is requested, but unavailable we usually do not purchase a different brand unless it is specified that it is ok to do so on the grocery list. We follow this procedure to avoid potentially harmful issues with allergies. If you ever arrive to your room and see that an item you requested on your list is not there, please notify the front desk so that we can go about picking it up for you on the following grocery run.      Moving onto the issues of the shower and the A/C unit. If you ever have any kind of maintenance issue, such as an A/C unit that won't go below 75 or a shower that won't produce hot water, the best thing to do is contact the front desk immediately. When a guest calls in a maintenance issue we immediately respond by sending out an engineer to repair the situation. We take any service request very seriously and greatly encourage all guests to notify us of any maintenance problems as early as possible. This enables us to fix the problem quickly and get your stay back on the right track.      Finally, dealing with the issue of the beds. Many of our guests are unaware that we offer pillow top mattress pads that add a good amount of cushion to any of our mattresses. If you ever feel that your bed is too firm, we greatly encourage you to contact the front desk so that we can set up a mattress pad on your bed and help you get a good nights rest.      Thank you again for your review. I really hope that this response has helped you and any guests who decide to stay at our property in the future. I really hope that you will give us another chance on your next trip to the Anaheim Resort Area. If you do, I would love for you to give me a call prior to your arrival so that I can help oversee that your accommodations are in order. Just call the hotel directly and ask for Roger Rodriguez, Sales Manager.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1235,45

Our staff really does a great job of accommodating our guests and with all the families that come in and out of our doors... they really do a great job of taking care of them and their needs!  It was fantastic to hear that we were able to meet your requests of a early check in and upper level suite...however...I do need to share that there are times when it's not always possible for us to accommodate early check-in requests.  This truly depends on what our occupancy looks like the night prior because if we are sold out or near a sell out...our housekeeping staff truly needs ample time to go in and prepare the suite for the new guest expected to arrive at normal check-in time which is 4pm.  We always do our best to accommodate early check-in requests when possible.  Thank you so much for all the wonderful comments, our staff values your feedback because it really is a way for us to learn how to improve our service and also recognize the things that we may have done well.  In the end, there's nothing more special than being able to impact our families & guests in such a positive way!  Until next time!

We are even more excited to hear that you and your family enjoyed yourselves while staying here with us at The Residence Inn Anaheim - Maingate!  I'd like to share that not all of our suites offer a fireplace but I am very happy you got to experience that wonderful touch.  We are a Generation 1 Residence, the first design that was created when the Residence Inn Brand first was developed.  Because of this, we are able to offer that condo style atmosphere versus being a high rise Residence Inn hotel.  Although our hotel is a little over 20 years old now we have upgraded our suites to incorporate the granite countertops, new cabinetry and new full sized appliances as well.  It's a hotel that definitely has a unique personality which is so wonderful for families travelling to Disneyland on vacation! Because we truly are spread out across about 11 acres...it's truly important to us that we keep up with the maintenance on our hotel grounds and buildings.  Tip:  Be sure to check with our Front Desk Staff as often times local restaurants will give us special coupons to give to our guests to be redeemed at their restaurants:) It was so great to read your review and thank you being as descriptive as you were!  It really helps paint that picture for those families that might be considering our hotel!  We look forward to possibly serving you again in the future... Have a wonderful summer!

Thank you so much for sharing the details of what you experienced while staying here at The Residence Inn Anaheim - Maingate!  Our staff is very thankful for TripAdvisor and the comments left by all, good and bad.  It truly allows us to listen and learn directly from the most important people...our guests.  As you learned, we're great for larger families because of our Penthouse Suites that can accommodate up to 8ppl.  When you factor in all that is included in the rate with all the free amenities that we offer (breakfast, grocery shopping services, social hours, parking etc.), you'll see that you really can save so much money.  This in turn, makes a family vacation for larger families more possible than they realize!  I'm so glad you shared the fact that we have a Disney Desk.  We are one of few hotels that offers this feature.  Our Disney Desk is operated by an actual Disney Cast Member with all the park info you could ask for!  Our guests are offered special Park Hopper prices through this Disney Desk as well.  You can access ticket pricing through our website and by clicking on the Disney Desk Link on our homepage.  Here you will find a ton of fun information regarding the parks helping you plan your vacation.  Guests can even make reservations for Disney restaurants through the Disney Desk directly.  It's great!  No standing in line etc.  You are absolutely correct in stating that our breakfast area does get quite busy around 9am.  We begin serving breakfast M-F at 6:30am, which is why we do suggest that large families try to arrive a little early to beat the last minute rush.  And there is always a huge rush in the last 1/2 hour before breakfast ends.  Aside from the main Gatehouse area for sitting down to eat breakfast, we also offer 2 outside patios and seating outside by the pool as well...guests are also more than welcome to take their breakfasts back to their suites to enjoy as well.  With regards to our beds, we completely understand that what is considered comfortable to some may not be to others... however, we are so happy to hear you were pleased with the comfort of our beds.  For future reference, for those guests that do feel their bed is too hard/firm...please let our front desk know as we are able to accommodate by supplying you with added foam tops.  Again, thank you so much for sharing your experience and I'm so happy your 9 months of planning was well worth it!

We were told the pool was open 24/7 but we could call if it got too loud and they would take care of the problem.

Thank you,",June 2010,none,none,"Dear Junglejoy, First off, I am deeply sorry for the horrible customer service you feel you were given.  Guest Reviews and feedback are super important to us whether good or bad because it allows us to learn and grow at the same time. Guest Experience is truly a top priority among our staff and team and we recognize that 95% of our guests are visiting us on vacation with children of all ages.  Our hotel is truly quite different than most as it is a ""condo style"" hotel spread out across approximately 11 acres.  Because this is how we are designed it often times can be much more difficult to control noise in our shared public areas (sports court/ swimming pool etc.)... versus a high rise hotel that has floors with inside corridors and is completely away from the outside shared activity areas.  You are absolutely correct in stating that our pool is open 24 hours.  Our sports court area is opened from 9am - 10pm.  Please know that it really truly is awfully hard for our staff to demand our families on vacation who are enjoying the pool in the middle of the day to not allow their kids to do cannonballs or play on the sports court.  For this reason, whenever we get a complaint of noise from any guests staying in any of our suites within the proximity of these locations, we make no hesiation to relocate, based on availability.  Unfortunately, in these situations,  there are times when families decline to relocate.  After speaking with my team, I am confident that this offer was extended to you and your family, what is unclear at this time,  is why the move didn't take place. Our team was under the impression that they had taken the necessary steps to make this experience right for you and your family. Please know that we have definitely learned from this experience and are diligently working on ways of improving our communication with our guests.  Again, we apologize and we would like to thank you for taking the time to post your review. Warmest Regards, Misty Grayson",none,none,none,none,none,none,1290,45

We’re looking forward to your stay here with us in Anaheim as well! The information you shared regarding “incidental charges” was great! Thank you as this provides me an opportunity to add, in more detail, to what was explained to you on behalf of my hotel specifically:  Our hotel places a PREAUTHORIZATION/ HOLD (ranging from $50-$90 which is based on the length of stay) for incidentals on the credit card of choice provided by the guest upon check-in.  This is not an actual “charge”.  Upon check-out, if the Guest has not incurred any incidental charges during their stay (telephone/ movies/ food etc.) the PREAUTHORIZATION/ HOLD that was placed on the card provided will then be released that same day of check-out by our hotel.  The type of card that is provided by the guest (debit or credit) can affect the time frame of when the hold is released to when those funds are then again available by the bank.  For those Guests that applied a “debit” card towards the authorization of their incidentals, please know that it can take anywhere from 3 – 5 days for the bank to release the authorization/ hold from their system.  I would like to reiterate that we actually release the authorization/ hold from the hotel’s system as soon as the Guest checks out.  There is some delay on the banks behalf.  If a Guest applies an actual CREDIT card (not debit card) towards their incidentals the delay time is much shorter, only 24 -48 hours, from the time we release the hold here on property to the time the bank actually releases the funds back into the Guest’s account. As debit cards are often tied to an actual checking accounts & cash funds versus credit on a credit card…this can pose a financial issue until the hold is released.  As always… thank you for allowing me to further explain!  Safe travels and we’ll see you soon here in Anaheim!",none,none,none,none,none,none,1315,45
