The front desk was kind and friendly. It was fairly quiet inside the rooms. The breakfast is disappointing, with a crowded room and staff who require you to eat there or not eat at all. They cited an Anaheim ordinance that prevents you from taking food outside of the very small breakfast area, which was confusing. The staff stated they were ""watching, with cameras everywhere"" if you left the room with any food at all. That was certainly a new experience. There were other odd things too, like staff documenting the number of towels requested and the extra roll of toilet paper we requested.

You came to the front desk Thursday morning and expressed concern about the plumbing issue and I have extremely sympathized.  I immediately made arrangements for an alternate room and offered to assist in transporting your belongings.  You declined the offer and moved rooms.

Rooms were decent size. Staff was nice and helpful.  Carl's Junior right next to hotel had excellent food prices. Internet worked well 90 % of the time.  The Cons:  We were told the hotel was 2 blocks from Disneyland several times before booking. We measured and it was actually 1 mile from the hotel entrance to where we turned in to the Disneyland main entrance. It was another 1-2 city blocks to the actual entrance. No shuttle was provided. 10 city blocks is suppose to be 1 mile and so it was actually over 11 blocks.

We're a college-aged group taking a fun road trip together, so we were looking for an inexpensive room with 3 beds at a good price, and the Anaheim Carriage Inn gave us just that.

The table and chairs was convenient for playing games, but with 3 beds and only 2 chairs the math was a little off.
