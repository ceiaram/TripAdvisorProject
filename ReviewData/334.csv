It was devastating and unheard of.   While we understood that the booking was not refundable, we called the hotel and explained our worries with traveling in that weather warning.

We wanted to reach out and offer our apologies as to what took place during your stay.  Our management team loves the challenge and opportunity to provide our guests with the best stay possible.  There will always be things that we wish we could have done better even if the guests feel that things are perfect!  We definitely take pride in our jobs here as a management team, and often times people can feel like we are even on the strict side!  We do agree that in the summer time, the rooms can get hot.  Most nights the ocean breeze sweeps through the property and offers some relief since we are right above the water, but there are some nights where we definitely feel like the rooms could use A/C, and we have made the owner aware of this.  We hope to have A/C in the rooms at some point in the future.        During the time of your stay we knew that there was a group of guests occupying multiple rooms on the wing that you were staying on.  We try our best to warn family gatherings that they need to be courteous to the guests around them as large family gatherings can be very overwhelming to guests that are not part of the family!  We actually completely agree with you on the fact that being next to a group or family can potentially ruin your stay.  Due to the fact that this particular group of guests were unable to act appropriately, even after being reminded of our quiet hours by members of our management team, they are no longer able to book with us in the future.  The group was definitely not related to the owner/management and was definitely not granted any sort of special treatment of any kind.  We understand that it definitely appeared that way by our lack of noticeable support on your behalf.   We have even entertained not allowing any group bookings to take place here at all because family gatherings are one of the hardest situations for us to manage.      We do allow up to 5 people to a room, but when potential guests ask about room size, we are very upfront with them and explain to them that we allow five but it is really ""tight"" with that amount of people in the room.  We try our best to be aware of how many people are in each room.  In this case, it was a family with multiple rooms and it is sometimes difficult to control who ends up in the rooms once quiet hour are in place.  Our rates are based on two people per room and there is an additional charge of 15$ per person, per night, after the first two guest (children under 8 are free but no more than 5 people total in the room) so we do have a good idea of how many people are in each room at the time of check in.  We have had a fair amount of guests tell us that we are very strict with this policy because we 100% care about how crowded our rooms are.  We realize that the more people are in a room, the potential for more noise goes up!  That nightly gathering should have absolutely taken place away from your room and we should have done a better job of reminding the guests to congregate in the areas designated for gatherings such as the fire pit or table areas. The large dog on the property........ This one is our greatest concern.  We are a strict non-smoking, non-pet property and have in fact enforced several fines for people that have not complied with these two policies.  In this particular case, this was a service dog, and with service dogs we legally cannot have them removed from the property.  The owner of the dog presented the service dog paperwork to our staff when they arrived, so we essentially had to allow the dog on the property even though we were very disappointed that we were not informed of the dog coming on the property prior to its arrival.  We did speak to the guests more than once to inform them that the dog had to be on a leash at all times while it was on the property.  Usually all service dogs are required to wear their vests while on the property so that other guests recognize that they are service animals.  The owner did not have a vest for the dog at the time so we made the difficult decision to allow the dog even without the vest.        We again feel horrible that the noise level was so great that it caused you to want to leave as soon as possible.  This is obviously not the goal that we have in mind for our guests.  Our number one goal is to have a quiet relaxing atmosphere here and most of the time, we can provide our guests with this type of environment.  However, we failed to do so for you guys.  We definitely have a lot of pride in this business and want it to be successful.  Even if we are booked a lot, we value every customer and would never want people to think that just because we have a high occupancy rate, that we don't need to value our clients as much.  We want everyone that stays here to feel and see that we take pride in our jobs as managers and value everyone's feedback.  In this particular case, we definitely appreciate and value your honest feedback.  We recognize the importance of taking care of our guests and we value every single one of them!        We hope you will give us a chance to redeem ourselves in the future.  We suggest coming back in fall/winter months as the weather is always good here in San Clemente, and there is usually more of a relaxed vibe here than in the summer months.  Hopefully this response provides a little clarity.  This response is not to be viewed as an excuse for what happened because we realize that we need to do a better job as a management team!

I really feel that the conductor is considerate at night by usually just tooting his horn in a nice way.  In the day, because of all the people at the pier around the crossing, it gets a little louder.  I did talk to the conductor and he said that it is the law that they have to blow the horn at a certain point.  As far as the shower, I am proud of our showers.  Like everything else we try hard to keep things in the original style, which is important to us.  Among many other things, we just added shower doors which do enhance the showers.  Different people prefer different types of hotels or motels.  Some would rather stay at a chain or a business class hotel, or something like the Ritz Carlton.  This is a historical, 1940 Spanish style motel, and people who stay here realize that and love the way it is.  Yes, we probably did have a nice chat, as I do with many people.  I live here and sometimes enjoy a glass of wine and a fine cigar.  If you would have mentioned that you like that sort of thing, I probably would have shared with you during our conversation.

4 helpful votes,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Perfect!,"This was a great place to stay. My husband and I are not picky, we just wanted something as close to the beach as possible for a reasonable price.  Simple, clean rooms, with a sink, refrigerator, stove, coffee pot and dishes. We could live in the room and be perfectly content. Wonderful ocean view and beautiful, gated grounds. In my opinion this is the best place to stay in San Clemente if what you are looking for is a place on the beach close to everything in town for a fair price. Big window and front porch to look out at the ocean (which is why you're here, right?). Just a short walk to the pier and delicious Fisherman's Restaurant. The train did not bother us at all. In fact, it was kind of nice. The bathroom is tiny, but clean. The bed was comfy and the heater really puts",December 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,145,334

I have not stayed here recently but I have stayed here several times in the past.   My sister stayed recently and has also stayed here several times with her husband.  The owners actually live on the property and are always friendly and courteous.  Once I left some of my daughters clothes and blankets in the dresser drawer there and I called 2 days after we left and I spoke to the owner and she said that she had all of my clothes I left which included some homemade blankets that my mother made.  I was very thankful they did not toss away or give away to someone.  Every room has an awesome view because they all face the,June 2003,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,146,334
13 helpful votes,38 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great View !,"Stayed here for a long weekend in June. If you read the reviews of this motel on TripAdvisor, you will find one complaining about the blinds not closing, no A/C, small accomodations and more.  I would not quarrel with any of those comments.  But at the Beachcomber, you are not checking into a plush resort, which you can probably figure out pretty quickly.  Instead, it is a locally owned property and kind of a throwback to an earlier time.  No phones in the room, spotty cell service, no wi fi.  We had a fabulous time.  The view is spectacular.  The owners/managers are very friendly and helpful.  The grounds are gorgeous and meticulously kept.  You can't beat sitting around a firepit in the evening, watching the sunset and drinking a glass of wine.

It is somewhat pricey for us ($220) but we booked Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The location is unbeatable with a large green lawn overlooking the Pacific Ocean and San Clemente pier.

This is the closest property to the beach! It rests on a cliff overlooking the beach. The room we stayed in was clean, had a spectacular view, and had a full kitchen (complete with pots, pans, plates, etc.)that we used on our first night.  The room we stayed in was clean and well maintained. What you are surrounded by plus their decent rates is a steal! The Beachcomber Motel is a neat little place to stay if you enjoy the whole panoramic view of the beach and if you enjoy waking up to the sounds of the beach. To add, in the evenings they have these little fire pits that you can warm up to while you enjoy the scenery.

Not a 5 star experience, but just an honest to goodness fun, relaxing week. The rooms are clean and have fully equipped kitchens. You don't stay at the Beachcomber for the rooms, though. You stay for the amazing views. There are 180 degree views from each room. The owners have plenty of chaise lounges, picnic tables and grills etc on their expansive lawn located on a  hill right above the San Clemente pier.

It really is a throwback to the 50's, and there are far too few places like it anymore.  There is nothing like sitting on your little porch, or around the fire pit, drinking wine and watching the sun set over the Pacific.

The location was perfect--just like the photo on the web site shows.  Open the door and there was the pier, the beach, and the surf.  So, naturally at $200 per night you're definitely paying for the location.  The room was clean, but the whole builiding was poorly maintained.  The first thing you see when opening the gate is crumbling stucco on the exterior, and crumbling steps (surprisingly) up to the owners residence.  Windows & doors don't close easily, and the whole place needed some TLC.  The apartment is tiny, there's no closet in the sleeping area (which is separated from the living area by curtians.)

Our room was very clean.  I usually go into a hotel spraying lysol everywhere but not here.  You can tell the owners take great care of this place.  Parking was a little tight with our big truck but we managed.  We stayed in room #1.  It was a one bedroom and our five year old son loved the bunkbeds.

The view is amazing and you are walking distance from the pier, about three or four great places to eat, and the beach...  the biggest downside for me was that you are separated from the beach by traintracks, and the only thing separating the rooms from the tracks is a great big steep hill.  my wife and I were accompanied by our two children (5 and 2) so obviously this brought a little more of a concern than if we travelled alone.

I have never stayed there so I cannot comment on the rooms or the service, but the view is stunning.  This is the closest to the water you can get and the grounds are green and gorgeous.  They have the only patch of grass around.  The hotel is so quaint looking from the outside and each room at this ranch style, single story building, has it's own little porch with chairs and sits on a bluff right over the sand.  It is just steps away from the pier and the Fisherman's restaurant.  This is the best place for amazing clam chowder and out of this world, hot fresh loaves of sourdough bread.
