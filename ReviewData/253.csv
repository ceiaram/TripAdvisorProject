We enjoyed our stay.  Both the property and staff met expectations for the brand and price point.  The room was average sized, comfortable for two adults and offered a mini fridge, coffee maker, etc. I really appreciated the quality of the mattress and slept well throughout the stay.    Breakfast was included in the rate and offered a good selection of items including eggs, sausage, waffles, assorted breads & condiments, prepackaged pastries, fruit, yogurt, coffee, tea and juice.

I can't change your room. You had requested a smoking room."" Did not recall requesting this; tried to diplomatically show clerk the confirmation where smoking was not stated.

We have had problems in the past with online reservations coming in last minute (when we are  sold out of non-smoking rooms) with a smoking room and when those guest(s) come to check in, we have to be the bearer of bad news and inform them they do not have a non-smoking room. In an attempt to combat this very inconvenient problem for guests, such as yourself, we do ask our team members to contact guest(s) as soon as they see reservations that meet these stipulations come through to verify the reservation with the guest(s) so that we can give our guest(s) as much time as we can to find other accommodations(if we no longer have non-smoking rooms available). We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you, we know that finding out this information can be very frustrating and seriously make or break a vacation/business trip. We would have loved to accommodate you or any other guest(s) when this situation occurs, but unfortunately we are also bound by the number of rooms we have available on any given night.   Additionally, the Front Office Manager, Jose Sevilla, and myself wish we could work seven days a week so that we can take care of each and every guest hands-on, but we have full confidence in each and every team member under our wing. We implore each member of our team to take matters into their own hands; moreover, we empower them to make their own decisions while weighing those decisions against their training. We are here Monday-Friday, 7:00am-5:00pm in office, to analyze our teams' decisions, guide them toward decisions that bring guest satisfaction, and assist guest(s) hands-on.  Lastly, we sincerely want to apologize, and we want to reiterate that we completely understand how much this information can negatively impact your stay. Our team member contacted Mr. Sevilla immediately following your initial contact with our GSA, for additional guidance to reaffirm that the decision she made was the best possible decision (given the availability), and after confirming that we had no non-smoking suites or non-smoking standard rooms available- we were left with the decision that was reached. We hope that you can see what our intention was and can understand the circumstances we all had to maneuver with. Trying to sell the room for more revenue and thus lead you toward dissatisfaction is not what we are about at the Best Western Los Alamitos Inn & Suites.

Only because I had all the documentation did they reluctantly accept my pre-paid reservation.  This is exactly the kind of anxiety that the buisiness traveler does not need or want.
