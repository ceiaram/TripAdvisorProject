The location was great.  There were many restaurants and stores witin walking distance.  It was only about ten minutes away from Disneyland, and had easy access to major highways, such as the 5.  But the service was horrible.  There was literally no housekeeping at all at the hotel.  They provided me with two towels and washcloths for the whole week and never replaced them.  I only had two rolls of toilet paper, and had to ask the front desk for another one.  I ended up buying my own toilet paper.  Plus there was a huge dent in the shower, and the lights in the hotel kept flickering on and off.  I would not stay there again.  I know that we may be in a",September 2022,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,27

There was old pizza on a cardboard ""plate"" in the microwave; Bacon on the carpet (I'm guessing a former pizza topping); White pieces of ""popcorn""on the carpet; An earring laying on the floor beside a chair; The rubber cover from an earbud; Hair on the pillow; and many, many mysterious carpet spots. Also, the window in the bathroom had no way to lock or secure it closed. We went and bought cleaning supplies and were going to tough it out. But when we returned, our key wouldn't work. Some how our key that was supposed to be for our room 105A opened 105. Unbeknownst to us, we went in and left our things in the wrong room. The manager/owner wouldn't allow us to use 105A (which was cleaner) because we had went into 105. And",February 2020,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,27
5 helpful votes,5 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Filthy rooms,"Arrived at 12:30 pm to a locked lobby, rang the bell and waited 5 min. for someone to answer. Checked in and was given a TV remote which did not work, went back down to the lobby and rang two different bells for at least 10 minutes before he answered. The worst part was the room. I had to leave on business and returned later that evening and surveyed the room and found the curtains were broken, the toilet seat was broken, the toilet paper holder was missing, found hair of all sorts including pubic hair in the shower, wash basin and on the pillow cases in the bed. All in all this was the filthiest place I have ever stayed. I did report this to the manager when I checked out and he turned his back on me when I finished telling him about the above issues. I hope this gets posted as",March 2016,Do not stay at this hotel!!!!!,Traveled on business,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,4,27
