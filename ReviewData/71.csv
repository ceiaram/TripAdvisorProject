There are  tiny tiny pillows on the bed, one for each sleeper.  There is NO elevator and one of us cannot do stairs.  There are no lamps in the room - it’s all overhead lighting or nothing.

All I hear in the man next door snoring and people yelling outside my door.  When we first checked in we were told there was a resort fee. Nothing about this place indicates that it is a resort. When we asked why we were being charged that they said it’s to cover the parking that is free. We didn’t have a car so we are basically paying for other people to park. There is absolutely no reason this place should be charging any additional fees and I think it’s just a way for this place to take every last dime from you.

After staying late nights in the parks to avoid the heat we didn't get much sleep because of the construction. I wish we had been notified outside of penalties so we could have canceled and booked somewhere else. Also I booked a family suite. I wouldn't consider the room we go to be a suite in any way.

For the one nigh stay person this is not an issue but we typically stay multiple nights and with a few people and there are only 2 draws, almost too small for one person. I would definitely suggest using some wall space for a dresser which would provide counter top space(really missing also) and storage for clothes so you are not living out of a suitcase.

I had read the reviews here and decided to give it a shot, so glad I did! There were 4 of us and we got a room with a separate bedroom so we had 3 beds. The one separate was a pull out couch that a couple of the girls grabbed. The place has gone through a recent remodeling and it was tastefully done. The housekeeping staff were meticulous and our room was so well kept, much appreciated when traveling with 3 teenagers! Front desk staff was friendly and accommodating, they even hooked me up with a ticket seller that saved me 40 bucks off walk in price and they delivered the next morning to the hotel!

Once 4 of us in a 2 full beds; this time 4 in a family suite (2 fulls + sofa sleeper). The rooms look modern & the beds are comfortable. The staff is always friendly. Keep in mind only 1 car per room no matter how many people are in the room. Also 2 stories but no elevator. So for these 1 give it a 3.   Why risky tho? Becuz late @ nite they allow cars to double park across the entrance & exits & in the lanes. I know they encourage it becuz they provide & put cones behind the cars. This is dangerous becuz paramedics & fire dept can't get into the parking lot-so better not have an emergency!

none,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Average- Not what we expected,"Cons- - The new style made us feel we were in a studio rather than a hotel. - Way too much echo in the room. - The people above us were so noisy. It sounded like a dance studio above us. - The floors were filthy. My 1 year old niece had dirty hands, feet and knees after only being in the room for an hour. We later realized they don't mop, only sweep when cleaning the rooms. - The sound of crickets every single night - Crickets were in our room 2 out of 4 nights (that we know of). - Didn't get new towels or toilet paper one of the days. - Closet space and drawers are limited (only 2 drawers in family suite). - Free parking but family suite only allows one parking space. - Prices are substantially lower for the same room next month. - No breakfast or coffee. - Not many",July 2016,none,none,"Thank you for breaking down your feedback on our property into two different categories.

It was in a great location within easy walking distance just down the road from Disneyland and California Adventure Park. They were still in the process of renovation with their signage not very clear. The room was nicely decorated but would only give it a 3 for cleanliness. The other negative was that there was no breakfast as advertised as it had apparently been discontinued the week before our stay. The desk attendant did however give us some muffins and apples when we queried it.  There are good affordable family restaurants nearby (we loved Coco's over the road).

none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing time,"First time traveling to california to visit Disneyland. What can I say? Pulling up I was a bit apprehensive but that was due to the remodeling of the landscape still going on. However, once I stepped into the room I was impressed, especially for the deal I paid. Oscar the front desk attendant was extremely helpful and very accommodating. We were originally given a second floor room,  but since we had a very rambunctious 2 year old we knew that wouldn't work and Oscar helped us out, no issues. Grace the over night attendant was also very polite and  helpful. On our last night she was very patient and helpful when it came to helping us print out our boarding passes for our morning flight back home. The hotel is only a 10 to 15 minute walk to Disneyland, California adventure, and",May 2015,none,none,"We are happy to hear that your stay at Eden Roc Inn and Suites was a pleasant one and that our team members shined for you during your stay. We are particularly happy to hear that our team members shined for you during your stay, and that they were able to accommodate the needs of your family.

3 helpful votes,4 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,great location for good price,"This hotel has been recently refurbished, so it is not your typical low-cost Disney/convention center hotel.  We stayed in the family suite, which is absolutely huge.  My husband had good customer service most of the time at the front desk, except when he mentioned our door was having trouble shutting.  The problem was fixed though.  My biggest complaint would be that the maid staff does not seem to follow the management's signs regarding re-use of towels to save water.  Every day we would hang our towels up to reuse, but they were replaced.  My one suggestion to the owners would be to place a small dinning-type table in the suites, there is plenty of room in them for one without feeling crowded.",April 2015,none,none,"Thank you for providing us with your feedback on your recent stay at Eden Roc Inn and Suites.

Clean room, bedding, and bath is all that I ask and this hotel delivered.  We all slept really well, either because of comfy beds, or we were just tired from 10 mile days of walking at Disneyland. Property was still in the process of remodeling the grounds.  It's a half mile walk to Downtown Disney. Came home late one night couldn't find parking but security helped me find something that would work.  I would definitely stay here again.  It fits my budget and clean and comfy standards.

I was told all was well and cancelled, but my credit card was charged for the first night. I called to talk to someone about it, and 3 WEEKS later I finally got a hold of the manager, who claimed it had never been cancelled and was unwilling to budge.

My email was undeliverable.  My husband and I recently stayed at Eden Roc April 7-10, 2015.    The rooms were lovely, clean and comfortable.  The customer service however was lacking.     We stayed while visiting Disneyland with our son and his wife, and our grandchildren.   Although our children headed out, my husband and I decided to see if we could stay one more night and then head up the coast for an extended vacation.    He asked the night before if that would be possible and was told it was. The next morning he was told that we could stay, but must change rooms.

Right near the convention center, a 10/15 minute walk to Disneyland and to Downtown Disney. Bus stop nearby that can take you to all the parks and if you hop the 18 it will take you to Knott's Berry. Staff was wonderful, especially the night shift. There are two restaurants on the corner's, I suggest Coco's. This place is not too far from Angel's Stadium. You can see the Disney fireworks display from here if you have a room on the northern side. They did some nice renovations, the floors are not carpeted, which does mean you can hear things every now and then.
