I let them know and Joe was there is a few minutes to fix it. He was so nice and got it fixed. Something had been unplugged and had to reboot the cable box.

I was told by the BW reservation person when I made the reservation on the phone that we could park at the motel early as long as a spot was open.  However, when we arrived, the front office staff refused to allow us to park and implied that I  was lying about what I was told about parking.  The result was an hour lost finding alternative parking and a bad feeling about BW.

My parents a bit older and it was nice to have them walk back to the hotel when they got tired.  Room was nice, breakfast was good, and the staff were friendly.  I'll definitely consider another stay.   My only complaint is the noise at night. People that were coming back late night (we got in just before midnight).  People could be heard running/stomping around and slamming their room doors.  Since we stayed during the week day, we could hear trucks working in about 7 am.. either dump trucks or construction.

Have elevators for those who do not want stairs. Friendly staff in front office. Variety of foods for breakfast. First day had waffles, second day had pancakes. Both days had scrambled eggs, potatoes some kind of meet (turkey patty first day and ham the second) as well as some fruits, yogurt, cereal, breads/muffins, etc. Rooms clean, lots of pillows on beds. Beds fairly comfortable.  Cons: Not exactly close to Disneyland in my opinion....quite a walk and with young kids that would cause them to wear out before getting to the gates. So I payed to park at the disneyland garage and downtown disney. Save the walking for inside the park.

Our room had the king sized bed which was very spacious. The kids had the two double beds room which made it a little tighter. We noted that the adjoining rooms can open (by connecting door) into one large room should you desire. You are provided with lots of towels and plenty of pillows.  The location can not be beat-- you literally are on the door step of the Disney Resort. All you need to do is cross the street and go through the bus drop off area. A continental breakfast helps you get your fresh start to the day; the choice of items is decent and always plentiful.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.

27 helpful votes,40 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The best and the worst hotel in Anaheim,"This is a very difficult hotel to review. I think it is the best hotel in Anaheim and perhaps also the worst. Let's start with why I think it is the worst: The hotel feels like it is even build before Disneyland opened back in 1955. Americans are not used to very old building like we are in, for instance Amsterdam, The Netherlands, where people still live in building from the early 17th century. But this hotel in Anaheim is close to being that old.   The bathroom door hardly fits and barely closes, the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything. The floors are made out of cardboard and you can feel when a nearby guests steps out of his bed. When you close the door, the air pressure almost pushes out the windows. I doubt that this hotel will survive any serious earthquake.",July 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,789,151

First, the “negatives” – the room we had was a bit smaller and cramped to what we have had at other places and had fewer furnishings. Also, there is no on-site store for snacks, drinks, sundries etc. as some other motels do have.

AC's were a bit loud but not annoyingly loud - it actually lulled me to sleep.
