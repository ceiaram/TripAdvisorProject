There are a couple of design flaws that really bothered me.  1: we stayed in the grand suite, which is one of their larger rooms. The unfortunate part was, it’s just one big room. Although there are seating areas, there is nothing that separates the beds from the living area. Would be really nice to separate those two spaces. As it is with kids—you all go to bed at the same time. Rally makes a large room like this pointless.   2: The bathroom is just a sliding door, that does not lock.

Here are my reasons why. 1. Open porn channels. REALLY? I do not want my kids to happen upon porn and I do not know any families that do.  If you are a family friendly hotel then do away with the porn channel or at the least advise families and give them the option to block it. For this 1 reason alone, I will never return to this hotel nor will I reccommend it. 2. Hot tub water was extremely dirty.  You would come out smelling like dirty feet. 3. Bathroom has a sliding door that can not be locked. Terrible for privacy. 4. The noise from I-5 in the room was horrendous.  I felt like my bed was in the middle of the freeway.  Terrible sleep. 5.

6 helpful votes,20 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great place to stay very close to Disneyland,"Stayed here to do the Disneyland Half Marathon. Was so impressed with the facilities and service.  Danny set us up in a room away from the freeway so it was quite and was so welcoming.  The room was large enough that 4 people did not feel in each others way.  The room and bathroom were clean, the bed comfy, pillows comfortable, air at just the right temp. The cleaning staff was exceptional and checked on us later in the day to make sure all was satisfactory.  The breakfast was delicious and substantial.  Upon coming back from the Half marathon they had a goody bag of fruit, granola bar and water for our enjoyment.

We had a very spacious room. Two full beds and a very large sleeper sofa. We enjoyed having a table and kitchen area for our take out dinners. Friendly front desk staff. Plenty of options for the free breakfast (eggs, sausage, biscuits, fruit, pancakes, toast, bagels, etc) The only negative would be the bathroom sliding doors. Our toddler likes to open the door and there was no way to lock it from the inside. Parking was $15 a day plus resort taxes and fees which seem excessive for parking.
