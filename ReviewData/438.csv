The good news is, it's only about 10 minutes away if you want to take day trips to the beach. Btw-your receipt you tape to your window for the campground also works as a day pass to the State Beach Day-use area. So don't double pay.

Better than the San Clemente campground, which is technically closer to the water but not a surfable beach. San Mateo had larger campsites with trees for privacy and shade in between sites. Closest drive to San Onofre State Beach for surfing, and the $30 you paid for a campsite waives the $15 parking fee at the beach! There are no grills, only firepits, so we brought a spare oven rack which made for a perfect grill. It's also a dog-friendly campground, so our pooch had plenty of company. (San O beach also allows dogs, on leash.) Other reviews complain about squirrels -- bring your dog! We never saw one in our site. The only complaints: they don't have separate areas for RVs and tents. We were lucky the campers near us did not have",August 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,40,438

The campground was very nice, it was clean. The restrooms were cleaned daily and we always had a hot shower. We got lucky with our site and had a decent sized site. Be careful when you choose your site because we walked around and looked at the sites and some were super small. Had we gotten one of those sites our family would not have fit.  We were unlucky enough to get next to a large family that had tons of kids from baby to teenagers and  they were up at 6:00 am every morning talking like it was the middle of the day!

We were lucky since our camp spot was big and right next to restroom/ shower. The campground were full at the time we were there. It was clean and organized.   It was a great experience for me. The campsite has indoor hot shower, love it. You will need to pay 50 cent for 2.20 minute (not bad). The restrooms were clean during our stay. I felt safe and was quiet after 10 pm.  Each campsite comes with picnic table, firepit, and small bush/ tress for your privacy. It has beach trail about 1.5 miles to trestle beach.

I took all the neighborhood kids, many of them are on the High School Surf Team and we all loved every minute of it. We had to reserve two different spots #122 and #103 both nice and we couldn’t see our neighbors due to the dense bushes around these spots. I recommend spots from about #101 through #114 or so, these have more bushes and trees. Lots of things to do here, I’ve seen everything from rattlesnakes to a bald eagle at this campground. The place is covered with California Native Plants, several different types of Sage and California Buckwheat, Elderberries (these make a good pie), bladderpod (Indians used to eat these)...just to name a few–many of these plants attract the many birds that can be found here,",August 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,46,438

I must admit I was concerned when I read several bad reviews ranging from too much noise to stolen articles. San Mateo is located off the 5fwy and Exit Cristianitos. Camp Pendleton Marines actually own the property but camping is open to the public. Our experience was in San Mateo's RV loop which I believe is spaces 1-60. We stayed in space 48 and found the site clean and spacious by coastal RV site standards. The RV site provides water hookup and 20-30 amp electrical service, fire pit and a dump station at the front of the park. For around $29 per night it was well worth it. The surroundings were lush greenery, hiking trails and the famed Trestles surf beach 1 1/2 mi away (hiking distance) The",March 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,47,438

This time we were disappointed to discover that there is no one there to check anyone in during the evening hours. We arrived around 7:00 p.m. both nights this past week. Although we booked our reservations through the website and had our confirmation numbers with us, no one was there to check; also there was no one there at 6:00 a.m. when we left to go to the beach to surf. Therefore, we did not get the necessary sticker for our windshield to produce at the other State Parks the next day and we ended up paying an additional $10.00 fee.    Upon arriving at our site the 2nd night, we found someone in our site.

The inner loop is basically like a large group campground.  There is NO privacy between the campgrounds that back each other.  My real complaint has to do with the campground guests who thought staying up until 3 am screaming profanities at each other was an ideal vacation.  My husband and I ended up packing up everything at 3am and heading home because we couldn't sleep at all with all the noise.  No exaggeration, they were still going strong when we drove out.

We all enjoyed the campground, was VERY clean, the boys enjoyed the wildlife (rabbits, ground squirrels, birds), and the bathrooms were clean along with the showers.    Since its a State Park, we could go to San Clemente to boogie board and swim or to Doheny Beach at no entrance charge.  Then go back to the campground for the rest of the evening.

9 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Campground but Check the Cost.,"Nearly every year my family camps out at one of the local campsites here in California and many friends join us as well.  We have been to San Mateo Campground (SMC)  before and this time (August 2006) is a return visit.   We camp for 3 nights each time. The campground is well kept, very clean with lots of shade on most campsites.  Although SMC is well secluded, one thing that we find very convenient is the closeness to civilization.  A short trip of 1.5 mi and you're in San Clemente with plenty of shopping, restaurants and beaches. This all sounds real good but I must warn you of soething I feel is deceptive in the posted cost for the campsites. Two years ago we paid $25 per site per night.  This year we paid $27.50.  Not a bad increase, but although they claim 3 cars per",August 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,51,438
