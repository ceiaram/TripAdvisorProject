Check in was easy as I arrived and staff had already ran my credit card so most paperwork was done.  Several resturants close by so it was convenient to get something to eat.,August 2019,none,none,"Hi Fred,   Thank you for taking time to share your review with us.

Advice, check the mattress before you sleep on their foam topper matress filled with bed bugs- julianne",August 2018,none,Traveled solo,"Dear Julianne, We take bed bugs reports very seriously and sincerely apologize for your experience. Please know that we are on high alert regarding this issue and are mindful to monitor our rooms in order to address, treat and terminate any issues if we discover them. We have designed a thorough and strict procedure to address all complaints or potential issues within our hotel. Unfortunately, bed bugs are a world-wide problem and present a unique challenge due to their highly transient nature, traveling easily in luggage and clothing. This is why we continually train our housekeeping staff to proactively monitor all guest rooms for the potential presence of bed bugs and have standing contracts with professional exterminators to treat affected areas in case any are discovered on our premises. No room gets released until we have and all-clear from them. Please contact our guest relations department at 1-855-787-9864 to better address this situation. Thank you again for bringing this issue to our attention.",none,none,none,none,none,none,2,383
