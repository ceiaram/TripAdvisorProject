Only negative is the computers in the business center are on the slow side and several breakfast items were empty at 9:50 AM with breakfast ending at 10 and were never replenished.,October 2017,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,225,112

The staff was just amazing they would greet you weather you were coming in or going out.  The pool and Jacuzzi and everything outside nice and clean. Clean towels out there for you and two the gazebos.  Breakfast was good also.

Clean, friendly staff, and nice ammenities.  The location was very convienient off I-5, but far enough to be nice and quiet.  There were a few restaurants to choose from nearby (a short drive) - I recommend Bahar Restaurant - it's above the grocery store, but the food was great!!",September 2017,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,229,112
