We were greeted by an extremely rude woman at the front desk who informed us our reservation had been cancelled. We hadn’t cancelled it. We had missed the first night due to our cancelled flight and the hotel had not reached out to us so we assumed it was fine to show up and check in the next night. The woman behind the desk informed us we had no room to stay in. After her berating us for five minutes we finally asked “are there other rooms available?” since she didn’t even offer to check and see if there were.

Our usual go-to good neighbor hotel was closed for remodeling so we tried Camelot. Upon arrival the staff was very nice…the valet staff was friendly and helpful and the front desk attendant was very pleasant. It’s valet parking only (which I was a bit unsure of at first), but it was so convenient and I actually felt like our car was safer from dings and whatnot. Cost us $103 to park our vehicle for the days we were there. I definitely dislike the additional parking fee since we’re already a paying customer, but most of the hotels around Disneyland are the same way so we knew to expect that.

You can't park your own car and you have to rely on valet service.

These are nice hotels and are close.  They can run anywhere from $400 to $700 per night depending on season and room availability.  2) If you don't want to spend that much money, any one of five or six ""Inn's"" on Harbor Blvd. will be close and not too pricey.

To describe the suite, the first room had a queen bed and sofa bed, and kitchen facilities.  A door from this room opened into the second room, which had two queen beds and the bathroom.  GOOD POINTS: Cheap. Short walk to Disneyland. Free basic breakfast (consisting of cereal and pastries). Suite was very roomy. Air-conditioning.  BAD POINTS: Only one bathroom between 8 people. To access the bathroom, you had to walk into the second bedroom.  Overall, It was a clean, cheap hotel.  However, if you are travelling in a group of 8 people, I would find a hotel that has more than one bathroom in the two bedroom suite!",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,886,106
