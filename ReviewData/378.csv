none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,False advertising! They do not honor this price!,"False advertising They would not honor the listed price of 79 when paying at location. I even showed them the listing and they said that price is only when you pay on line. Even though it clearly states pay at location. Charging 90$ they say that room is not available. I asked what room they are giving me, and the girl was very rude and said she did. Not know. I said how can you not know what room you are giving me for 90.00 ?? I told the girl she should not post a price they will not honor. Then a man came and gave me back my money so I left to the days in 2 miles away for 77.00 with tax in a way nice room than trashy motel. Go to days in on imperial the room is 10 x better and the people are nice and you won’t get bed bugs!! Stay away !!",March 2021,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,378

12 helpful votes,15 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excelente atención e instalaciones,"Fue una grata experiencia, el hotel es completamente nuevo y las instalaciones son excelentes ya que están inmersas en el bosque con diseño único, rodeados por un río y tienen ventanales que hacen que uno sienta estar descansando en medio del bosque, de las mejores vistas para recibir el día, son pocas habitaciones lo que hace que haya más tranquilidad, tiene una piscina de agua salada de tamaño regular suficiente para refrescarse.  Los dueños Doña Ana y Don Juan son muy amables y dan una atención personalizada, incluye full desayuno. Definitivamente lo recomiendo, puede ir con su pareja o algunos amigos. La playa está a unos 20 minutos en automóvil lo cual es lo más recomendable ya que el hotel queda adentrándose por un camino de lastre, puede ser cualquier automóvil.

You can walk around the corner to the 7-11 for coffee.  Front desk is nice though kind of confusing. The credit card reader didn't work so we got cash from an ATM.,August 2015,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,378

Rooms were very clean. The area is pretty good and the hotels in this area were costly. This is a great deal for the money.
