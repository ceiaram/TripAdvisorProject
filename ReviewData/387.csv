The pictures you see online are the same here at this location/property. There are photos of renovated rooms and there are also pictures of the standard rooms (non-renovated). You are correct, the Parks are about a mile away so if you are walking to Disneyland, you will definitely be walking about 20-25 minutes, especially, if you are doing it every day. I'm sorry for the lack of communication you had about the shuttles to the parks. If you need any information about that, you could always come in, and our front desk agents can help. I really don't know who would have told you there was a free shuttle from our property to the parks, when we do not have one. All of out front desk agents know all this information. Again, I'm sorry.  Any shuttles that run by Harbor Blvd (right outside our property) is the ART. (Anaheim Resort Transportation). Route 1 and Route 2 would be the ones to pick you up and take you to the parks. Those shuttles run every 20 minutes on the hour, and they run all day long on circular routes. The shuttles start running about approx. 45 minutes before park opening and they stop running about 1 hour after park closing. You can BUY the shuttle tickets right next door at the Denny's Restaurant.  FYI, there is also the Toy Story Parking Lot which is a block away (7-minute walking distance) where you can park $20 a day, and take the free shuttle they have.  As a last resort, you can also Uber or Lyft from the property, and most of the time the prices vary from $4.00- $8.00 depending on how busy the resort is.

While waiting on maintenance I discovered the toilet had FECES in it, and there was HAIR in the bed I checked (the room had two beds as a friend was to arrive the next day). I reported the issues to the manager. I said I’d be happy to stay in the room if she had it cleaned while I was out for the evening. While she was checking to see what she could do, I marked the sheets with an “ X” to ensure they were changed as I was getting a bad feeling from this hotel staff. The manager said she did not have housekeeping staff on duty at that time and she did",November 2017,none,none,"Thank you for your review. I do apologize in advance for the issues you had. We did move you rooms because you requested a safe. Now, with that being said, with the same in your new room, does need resetting because maybe the guest before had a personal code. So, I know for a fact, our Maintenance did go in there and reset it for your convenience. Now, before the room change, everything in that room was double checked before renting it, and there was no feces in the toilet because we would never rent out the room if it wasn't ready. It was also video recorded, so we can keep documentation of how clean we have our rooms. (Again, no feces in the toilet) Also, you mentioned that you found a hair in one of the beds. We did speak to you, and told you that there was no housekeeping at that hour that you wanted the sheets changed where you found the hair. So, 2 of our hotel staff went in that room and changed the sheets. It was only 1 bed you had a problem with, the other one, you had already moved the sheets around, like if, you were searching for something. So, after you got back, you still came to the front desk, asked for more sheets and a bed cover. At this point, to meet your requests, and keep you satisfied, the front desk agent asked if you wanted another room, or if you wanted to stay in that room, and they can provide new sheets and a bed cover and you said it was fine. The front desk agent mentioned that you did not ask in a nicely matter about the sheets and that there was feces in the toilet still. We have documentation of everything that happens here at the front desk. You mentioned that there was no resolution that the Travelodge did for you, however, we compensated the night back to you. I don't understand if you are talking about Expedia.com. They are a 3rd party company, and you have to talk to them for any type of modification to your reservation or even moving you hotels. Again, we did apologize before for the inconveniences, and we are doing it now. I want to mention on more time, that we did credit back that night back to you.

We do apologize for any inconvenience this has caused, however, you need to understand that the weekend you were here, we had a special event at the Anaheim Convention Center and there was also Mickey's Halloween Party. So, we have been super busy and sold out. For those reasons, we did try to accommodate you to put you in the 1st floor even though out 3rd floor was all occupied. All the issues you said you had, we wished you could have reported them right away, because we would have had the chance to try and correct it and wouldn't have let you stayed in that room since you were already having issues in the beginning. We always encourage guests to come to the front desk or call, to report anything that they are experiencing since check in. Again, we understand it can be frustrating and we would only want you to have an enjoyable stay, however, we did not have the chance to try and fix any issues, since it was not reported on that moment. I also want to mention that any busy weekend, and or have special events at the Disneyland Resort, all prices around the area are going to be something similar to what you paid for. I'm sorry, but those are the rates that everyone will see. We also respect that you wont be coming back again, which we are sad to hear, however, we are planning to renovate soon after the busy season is over, and we do want you to come back in the near future when all changes are made.

I peeked in other rooms when doors were open and the other rooms had pictures on the wall and better bedding than what we had.

It also offers a free breakfast which is pretty decent.  You can also catch a ride on the toy story shuttle in the parking lot directly across that will take you to Disneyland.  Its also right next to a Denny's so that's a plus if you want something quick to eat.  The downfall was that the pool and spa both were not working.  The shower had to be the worst shower I have ever used in my life.  No water pressure and the temperature of the water kept going from extremely hot to cold.,June 2016,none,none,"Thank you for your review. We are happy to know that your stay was satisfying. You are absolutely right, we are really close to the Toy Story Parking lot provided by the Disneyland Resort, you can park or walk in that lot and take the free shuttle provided by them for free straight to the main gates of the Parks. Moreover, if you do not want to walk all the way to the parking lot, you can take the A.R.T Shuttle (Anaheim Resort Transit) right outside our hotel to the main gates of Disneyland, but will have to pay for the shuttle tickets as you are getting on the shuttle. Sorry for the inconvenience about the pool and spa being out of order. We are under renovations, and we hope that they will be done soon.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Bad service,"I was not expecting much from the room when paying $60 a night.  It was clean, and the cleaning service came every day.  The free continental breakfast was lacking, but you can't complain when it is complementary. It is very close to the convention center, and relatively close to Disney.  The pool was out of service which was a bummer.  The main thing that ruined the hotel experience was the front desk staff.  They were unresponsive and you had to make a request multiple times before it was resolved (ie minifridge in room).  We were pretty much ignored for 5 minutes when we went to check in and they were sitting at the front desk.  Also, we made it clear we wanted to charge multiple cards when checking out (split the cost over multiple people) and were assured we could.  When",June 2016,none,none,"Thank you for your feedback.

We had $75 available on a card for incidentals and was willing to give cash for the balance. The front desk called the manager at home Cheryl and she said absolutely not. It was 11:00 pm at night and we had to call priceline and have them talk to the front desk which took almost 1 hour of our time.

I want to start and say that we are sorry for the inconvenience that the 3rd party you booked with put you through, it must have been not accommodating at all.

Unfortunately, most of them tell  you after you book with them, so we are sorry for that inconvenience. As for the deposit that the hotel states, it is $100 on a credit card or $200 in cash. Now, when we hold it on the card it has to be the $100 completely and it cannot be less. When it's cash it has to be the $200 completely, again, it cant be less. That is our hotel policy.
