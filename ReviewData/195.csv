The breakfast that starts at 6:30am is included with the stay is sooo convenient when you are with young kids. It has the full spread with anything a kid would want (yogurt, cereal, waffles, bagels, muffins), and this morning it included omelettes and an oatmeal bar. I was happy to be able to eat healthy before a big Disney day. So appreciated and it’s clear the staff are working so hard to keep everything spotless everywhere at the resort.

It works well for our family.  Unfortunately it was not ready until hours past our check-in time. Our daughter was very frustrated. Tired. Overstimulated. It made for a very long evening that we had to wait hours extra hours for our room… on top of our travel time. Parking is extremely expensive. More expensive than the nearby theme park. The price of parking & the cost of the rooms couldn’t justify sitting in the lobby with kids for hours or waiting on blankets & pillows til after 10 pm. You can find a nearby hotel with parking and rooms half the cost.. Food was terrible. Only half of the hotel building receives complementary breakfast?

The restaurants weren't open.  3. The breakfast buffet was a grab and go but was essentially the same item for multiple days and they didn't have milk, which my kids complained about.  Now 2 & 3 are likely due to COVID, so I definitely would consider staying here again.",July 2021,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,97,195

Right now the pool has not been filled, the restaurant and breakfast area is under construction, and the two bedroom suite I ordered online was not ready so it was replaced by two studio rooms and I was not charged for the original two bedroom suite. The rooms were brand new-- one room we had was facing the I-5 highway and you had to strain to hear any road noise. The rooms facing away from the highway had a partial view of the fireworks at Disneyland. There are no tub mats so consider bringing your own. The refrigerators were the biggest I have ever seen in a hotel. You could fit a frozen pizza in the freezer even though you couldn't cook it in the microwave. The kitchen was well equipped and The toaster is in the bottom",July 2021,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,98,195

I will not go into the nitty gritty of the issues we encountered during our first vacation out of quarantine, but let's just say, I wish Hilton Management had laid a disclaimer (and they should!!) that this hotel is a brand-new build and not at full operating capacity.  My family and our friends booked our Disneyland/Universal trip back early May and reserved this hotel. Not knowing until two weeks before our arrival that this hotel was not fully operational (I was only alerted after reading a recent review). When I called the hotel to inquire about the state of affairs, I was met with an elitist attitude and told that the onus was on me to find out and ask the right",June 2021,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,99,195

It was great to be able to walk to Disney, just 15 minutes away.  Restaurant and pool was still under construction but they provided breakfast on to go boxes which was perfect for us!",June 2021,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,100,195
