This hotel has actual suites, with separate bedrooms, and even 2 bathrooms in their 2 bedroom suites.  Excellent for a family of 6, and hard to find.  The breakfast area is excellent.

We stayed here for 9 nights with adult kids and having 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms was the only way we could have gotten ready on time  for our busy days at Disney etc. I liked the fact that the sink in 2 queen bedroom was outside the toilet/bathtub area so I could get my makeup on while someone was showering.There is another bathtub/sink and toilet off 2nd bedroom (with bunk beds) but just a note- there is no blow dryer in that one so you might want to pack your own if you are counting on using it.  There is a living room with a terrible sofa bed in between these two bedrooms. Sofa beds definitely need to be replaced! Everyone also commented on how thick and hard the pillows are.

I've been wanting to stay here again but the prices are always so high I have not usually chosen this hotel for our Disney trips.

This hotel was just fine, but a little lower than the typical Marriott standard, in my opinion.

After searching hotels in the area, we found this hotel was the only one that had  2 bedroom / 2 bath rooms available.  This was the ideal set up instead of getting two regular rooms.  One room had a twin bunk bed and the other had a king.  Then the living room had a pull out sleeper.  The space was tight but didn't bother us as we were really on in the room to end the day and sleep.  They put us on the top level in a room at the very end of the hall - loved it.  Surprisingly quiet for a hotel that caters to kids.  Floors seemed like there were made of concrete.   Few other things.

I was so impressed by the Residence Inn Garden Grove that I had to submit a review. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They stopped what they were doing to help and inform their guests. We were also going to Disneyland and making our accommodations through them was so easy and stress free. This allowed us to focus on our family and have a great trip!

We had a  2 queen suite, with kitchen, small dining area, and a living room, 2 TV's and a somewhat smallish bathroom.  The hotel is located about 1 mile from the Disneyland entrance.  There's no free shuttle, but there's a shuttle that stops right outside the hotel (on Harbor) and costs about $5 per person.  We chose to drive and park for convenience (and the fact that if you have at least 3 people to transport, then driving and parking costs only $2 more than the shuttle).

The hotel is about a mile from Disneyland.  They have a shuttle run by PCA that stops in front of the hotel twice an hour.  And you buy tickets just outside of the hotel front door.  When we were researching on the internet we had trouble locating shuttle info.  The Residence Inn is the first pickup going to the park as well as the first drop off returning.    We had a room that had a main bedroom with a king bed and a 2nd room with bunk beds.  The both bedrooms had their own bathrooms which is perfect for a family.  The full kitchen gave us a place to store our food and drinks in the fridge.  As well as dishes when one night we were so tired we just ate in the room.

We called several times to have it fixed and each time a maintenance person told us it was fixed, but it never was. We asked for fans and that helped at night but were a nuisance during the day with an 8, 5 and 1 year old running around. Our experience outside of the AC was very good.

Breakfast was included (very good selection - eggs, sausage, waffles, toast, bagels, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit - though the eggs were a bit disappointing) and on week nights, dinner too (recommend taco night and BBQ night)! I found it strange (and upsetting) that everything was served on styrofoam plates with disposable cutlery. And there didn't seem to be any recycling or compost.

Most of my Marriott stays are at Residence Inn’s since you feel like you are at home.  It’s nice to have a place to spend time at that you can cook a light meal or even bring your dog if you want to.  This particular property is one of the better Residence Inn’s that I have stayed at.  It’s a great value for families going to Disney.  I saw so many out of state SUV’s with folks unpacking coolers and all kinds of stuff to make their week enjoyable.  There is a Target across the street for anything that you forgot! I bought food for the nights when there was no dinner reception and still had food left over.  I also like the idea of being able to make myself a midnight snack if I want to have it in the room.

The accomodations were nice, but less than I expected.  The mattress on the King bed was cheap foam, the linens were poor quality, the towels smelled like gym towels.

The room is CROWDED, but you CAN take the food up to your room:)  They close the food lines too early for me ~ 9am...

The complimentary evening snack/meal is simple usually spagetti or burgers but is okay.The downside is that you have to make sure you are back at the hotel between 5 and 7pm and that is sometimes not possible if you are in a lineup at the park!
