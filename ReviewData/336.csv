The room was not serviced Sunday or Monday, my fault I was told to ask for the service. I asked for it Tuesday morning because we extend our stay until Saturday morning. The service was horrible, the room was barely touched. I went downstairs and complained , they said I have to ask for full service, I got a refresh. I asked for full service on Tuesday and it was good. Then the hotel called me and said we will clean the room every other day which meant Thursday. There was no cleaning on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Again I have been a Marriott member for 24 years, never saw such incompetence.

First impressions - nice large lobby and entrance area with amazing sports facilities and gym.   What’s bad  Service is not as you’d expect for the price you pay - it’s slow and not very friendly . First impressions last and it doesn’t cost anyone to be nice . Maybe staff aren’t happy etc.  Parking is $27 per day Internet - hidden additional charges at $10 per day (had this removed from bill) Housekeeping by request only and not guaranteed .

Given I wasn't entitled to any room cleaning services and I attach pictures of the state of the room when I checked in and I was in the room as a solo guest. So I have no idea how they can justify the cost going up every night for 0 changes/enhancements etc.  This hotel is not inclusive of any meals drinks so I had those charges on top of the room fees hence I would expect my hotel room to be flawless.

It's kind of a quirky hotel that attracts a mix of budget business travelers and families I imagine.  The rooms are spacious, clean and modern.  The theme of the hotel is fitness, with the very large state of the art facility (with kids club) - - the rooms have dumbbells and pictures of fitness equipment so that's kind of funny.  Unfortunately, I did not get to check out the health club in its entirety but we did use the kids pool and jacuzzi and those were nice.  The kids pool has a nice water slide structure.  There is a health/snack/juice bar which I thought was limited but still good for the basics.  The restaurant downstairs offers typical budget hotel fare.  I would say the service level was not the best.  Housekeeping",December 2015,none,none,"Dear nab_nyc,  Thank you for staying with us here at the Renaissance ClubSport Hotel, near Laguna Beach.

We would like to take time as well, to clarify a few of the statements made in regard to the above review.  The sanitation and cleanliness of both our food preparation and presentation is of the utmost importance to us here at Renaissance ClubSport. We follow very strict guidelines and have always implemented policies and procedures to maintain our excellent standards of practice.   While you stated that your son had unfortunately had fallen ill during your vacation here, what fails to be mentioned is that we did strongly suggest that you visit a local medical facility for any treatment that may have been necessary at that time given his illness. Our Manager on Duty that weekend offered to help coordinate a local doctor; however, you graciously declined.  As stated within your review, and truly, whether being at Renaissance ClubSport, or anywhere else, if you deemed this to be food poisoning, and given the severity of his condition, surely this would have been considered a medical emergency. As such, we will always recommend local professional medical care for any of our hotel guests.  As we do not utilize a standard copy and paste response to our reviews, we simply state the many reasons that one may fall ill when traveling across North America. As we are a service- oriented business, listening to each of our guests’ comments is certainly of extreme importance to us. That said, we do hope that your son is feeling better now, and we hope to have the opportunity to serve you again in the future.   Sincerely,  Edward J.

If I had not complained about the quality of the room we would not have been moved to the room that we had paid for. Check in staff need to be honest.

Made to order omelet station, waffle station, fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, potatoes, biscuits, gravy, yum!  This resort has a huge 25,000 square foot gym with everything you can imagine.

The mattress was poor quality and had a feather duster on top.  The contoured sheet covered the duster but not the mattress.  The duster kept on shifting so we took it off the bed.  The duster stayed on the floor in the corner the entire visit although I asked for it to be removed.  The room was VERY DUSTY which was really bad for my allergies.  I had asked for a well dusted room when making the reservation but I was told no one on the staff even looked or were aware of my request.  I ended up dusting the room myself everyday.  ROOM SERVICE is a misnomer.  You can order it but it comes up to an hour later and then it is very cold.  The last day we figured out why.
