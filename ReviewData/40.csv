To clarify, reservations booked through other 3rd party sources, and not directly through IHG, do not qualify for points.  We see that was the case with your reservation, and our agent should have been more clear with their explanation.  If your friend booked through a direct channel, then that would explain how he/she received the points.  Additionally, our rates do not include a complimentary breakfast... unless you book a specific Bed and Breakfast Package or your company has a negotiated rate with us that includes a breakfast.  We do hope that this clarifies your questions. We will ensure that our team at the front desk is trained in explaining the options and parameters of our rewards and breakfast programs.

We certainly apologize that you didn't like the particular room that you were given upon check-in.  Let me address some of the concerns that you had: when booking on a 'blind' site which sells rooms at a discount, you'll typically have less choice in room selection than if you were to book directly with the hotel, though upon check-in, as we did in your case, we make every effort to accommodate specific room requests if we have the availability.  Our #1 goal is to ensure all guests, no matter where they booked their reservation, are happy with their room.  We do require a credit card or a deposit upon check-in, as do most hotels.  We typically don't accept gift cards as a method of deposit (I believe an exception was given in your case) -- as the 'hold' that the bank requires is longer than with a standard credit card.  We will, however, ensure that our front desk employees are more careful to tell our guests about the 'hold' on the debit cards. In regards to the shampoo/conditioner, our rooms automatically have only 1 bottle of each.

This too is usually seen as a plus by our guests.  As is the case in all parking lots, whenever one does not valet park, the user of the parking lot does so at their own risk.  As in most areas, we have rare but unfortunate incidents of theft.  The Buena Park police department is very good about keeping an eye on our property and most areas of the city’s Entertainment Zone in which we are located.  The hotel employs a security company that maintains a presence during the night throughout the property and we have other measures in place.  Unfortunately, as most people would agree, one cannot completely eliminate incidents.  Understandably, a victim of theft would be upset and want to point blame. We believe that this hotel does more than its due diligence in providing a safe and secure environment.

Plumbing concerns - -- but we truly appreciate it when guests let us know during their stay if there are issues, especially plumbing related, so that we can address them (most can be addressed fairly quickly and if not, we are happy to re-accommodate)We do routine maintenance and housekeeping checks for draining issues daily when cleaning, but problems do occur and we want to ensure they are addressed quickly for the convenience of all guests. After reading your review, we've gone through all of the Kidsuites and checked drainage and toilet functionality.  Playstation , DVD, remote- we have discontinued our playstation games as previous guests have invited themselves to the games (i've removed reference on our website) - and have sent our maintenance department to check on the sound for the DVD, which should be functional and have replaced the batteries on the remote control to resolve those issues- please let us know on future stays if issues such as this arise so we can fix them and so that you are not inconvenienced during your stay.  Housekeeping - this is a difficult issue, as some guests prefer a late housekeeping service and others prefer an early service.  Our housekeepers are available 8am - 5pm daily.  The best bet is to let the front desk or housekeeping department  know during your stay when you'd prefer for your room to be serviced so that we are able to meet your specific needs.  We do our very best to accommodate such requests.  Breakfast - we do not offer a 'free' breakfast, however kids to eat free at all Holiday Inn's -- and we do offer a Best 4 Breakfast rate which is typically only $15 more than Best Flexible Rate offer.  This is typically quite competitive with the other hotels in the are which offer a 'free' breakfast.  Lastly, we are very excited to let you and other readers know that we've been in the process of upgrading/updating our guest rooms.  We're replacing beds, adding bed 'toppers' for added comfort, upgraded linens and towls, new carpet/drapes, updated bathroom counters, etc, etc.  Take a look at our website as we've loaded the most recent photos.
