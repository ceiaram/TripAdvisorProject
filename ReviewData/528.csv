I was already having a bad trip with the person I traveled with (that's another long story), but the hotel was HORRIBLE!! Staying there made my experience 100x worse than it already was!  The WORST EVER! Front desk staff were not very friendly or helpful to me, especially when I was in a horrible situation with my roommate, the room was awful, and the location was very sketchy too. Plus, the rate was a total ripoff! The WiFi was awful, so, yeah, pretty much everything everyone has said about here is the same. NOT WORTH IT.

One room was fairly nice and pretty clean, the second room was more run down with obvious wear and tear. This is a budget hotel so I was not surprised at the condition. It looks like a family runs it and they try hard and the sheets are clean (Though the blankets were very questionable)  The location is odd. Half a mile one way you end up at Garden Grove and it is nice, half a mile the other way you end up in another much nicer part of town. It is an odd pocket of industrial, used car sales and other business units. Across the road was a California Show Girls dance place so the location is a bit odd.
