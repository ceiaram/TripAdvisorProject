My expectations were a 2.5 star hotel but I was pleasantly surprised by the renovations Signature did after they bought the Days Inn. All rooms were remodeled. I expected dirty carpets but got new vinyl plank floors. I expected an old bathroom but got a new tub and shower as well as a new toilet. Lights were LED and outlets were replaced with the white rectangular outlets. And the light switches were the rectangular wide on/off kind. The AC worked perfectly. Frig & Microwave also worked. Paint was new. my only complaint was the tub drain was super slow draining. I told the office and it was fixed ASAP. Parking was free and I could see my car from my window. I have no complaints.

This place is sadly overused and neglected. The front desk clerk gave us misinformation. Went to our room and there was NO WAY I would let my bare feet touch the floor. It was covered in stains, sticky to the touch and not vacuumed. The rest of the room felt like I would pick up some incurable disease. Took one look at the pool and hot tub and wanted to be sick. The water was YELLOW. There was no way I would put any of my body in there, much less let my child touch the water, much to her dismay. We only stayed because there was no place else. Took the kids to Disneyland and the next morning went to the complimentary breakfast. It was NOTHING like the picture on the website.

Trash, litter and cigarette butts are strewn all over the outside.  It's very apparant this property is not well maintained.  The ""breakfast"" was awful.  Breads, cold cereal and store bought apples.  Thats all.  Upon check in we were informed the pool was heated.  Not sure how the hotel defines heated, but we experienced a deeply frigid pool.  Not sure how they came up with ""Maingate"" in the name:  it's well over a mile and a half to Disneyland.  Parking next to rooms is very limited.  Adjacent parking lots are not well lit.

none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Not worth what we paid.,"We had originally booked our room for two nights, but decided to leave after one. The furniture and beds weren't in terrible condition, but you can tell the rooms haven't been renovated in a while. The biggest problem I encountered in the room was that very few of the electrical outlets had covers. There were exposed wires sticking out of the holes in the wall. I felt extremely uncomfortable letting my two year old daughter walk around in the room. I ended up having to use the chairs in the room to block her from going near the exposed outlets.",March 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,690,268

While the ""Maingate"" part of the name was a bit of a stretch, it was about a 20 minute walk to Disney's maingate, the Anaheim Resort Trolley stop was directly in front of the hotel.  Big perk there. The only thing that kept it from being perfect was a coffee pot that had the wrong lid. Partially brewed coffee went everywhere because of the wrong lid. (It didn't push the stopper up to allow the brewed coffee to flow into the pot. It ran out of the basket instead.) I broke the pot in the melee and it was replaced, again with the wrong top, again with an overflow mess. Thank goodness for the",March 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,691,268

If your expectations are average, and your not used to five star hotels this place is fine.  We just got back.  The beds are comfortable, that does not mean plush and cozy, but it means we all slept fine during our 5 night stay.  The matteress were fine. The towels were not thin, as I read in a earlier description, now if your used to plush thick towels you might think so, but realisticly they are fine. Water was always warm. The housekeeping will leave extra towels if you ask them, we left them 2.00 a day and the room was always clean and ready.

I was traveling with family (wife + 5 year old + 3 month old).  I specifically reserved a room with a refrigerator and microwave (paying $10 more than the same room without the fridge and microwave)  only because of the convenience it offered to a family with small kids. But the moment I checked in (around 10 PM) I noticed that the microwave and fridge were missing! I immediately complained but was told that the best they could do at that time was offer the fridge and microwave of the lobby.  But that was not acceptable to us for various reasons and we declined that offer. So not only did the milk that we got along with us go to waste, I had to make a couple of trips to the grocery store in the middle of",October 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,693,268

We chose this hotel because it is DOG FRIENDLY, and we had our pup with us.  In the past, some pet friendly hotels have tried to stick us in disgusting ""pet"" rooms; while we were in a room specifically designated for dogs, it was as clean as any other hotel room we've stayed in.  They actually seem to put the $25 cleaning fee to use here!  Upon check-in, our dog received a letter about his and his family's conduct during our stay, along with a yummy treat.  Cute!

Good public transport links to the rest of Orange County. Breakfast offers a decent selection. Vending machines on site, a Jack-in-the-Box next door and good high-speed internet in the lobby.  The average stuff..... the telephone charges listed on a card in the room, in the guest book and on the phone itself are all different. You don't really know what you are paying until you check out. The pool is small and overlooks Jack-in-the-Box next door, but the pool itself is ok.  Now the bad news...... the beds are quite uncomfortable.
