Still a clean property, easily located to most major activities and offering free and available parking! A score among the Stovall's Inns, most of which charge for parking and can be really challenging at times.  This place also still offers a complimentary breakfast at Denny's next door, featuring 3 items and a juice, from 6am to 10am. A great way to start the day, and better than any hotel breakfast I have ever experienced - more so now that COVID has destroyed most of those as well for the time being.  Once downside this visit is that housekeeping does not service the rooms, and if you need something like clean towels you need to call up front.

If you can get a deal through a travel agency of some sort to get a discount then do it.  Otherwise, at regular price, it is a horrible value.  The room with a single bed was big, nice, and comfy, but not worth $300 per night.  That is it as far as negatives go.  As I said at the start, everything else was great.

The rooms were clean and roomy and the staff very friendly. We walked everywhere and found the location fantastic - Directly across the road is the entrance to the Disneyland Car park so we found it took maybe 10mins to walk there. Theres a Dennys DIner on site which came in handy for a quick bite to eat and on the other side of the hotel there is a conveinience store and a GREAT pizza place - we ate there quite a few times. If you dont mind walking, 10mins down the road there is a few take out places (taco bell, Burger King) and a food for less supermarket. The bus stop is right out the front of the hotel as well so it was easy to be picked up for our day tours. My favorite part was the",March 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,963,308

It took us from the airport to our hotel, with perfect directions from the car rental firm and my wife!, about 45 minutes. We checked in with no fuss at all,and were put in a room on the first floor at the back of the motel, well away from the road, and from the outdoor pool, so had no complaints of traffic noise or noise from Denny's next door. The room was superb, and kept impeccably clean during our stay.

We didn't have much choice for when we decided to travel and I was a bit concered after reading the reviews that were posted as of January 2006. But the room is large compared to others around Disneyland. The only bad thing that I found was the room smelled mustly when we first arrived. We turned on the air conditioner to the fan option to bring in fresh air and we didn't have a propblem after that. We needed more towels and they were brought up immediatly. Also, our room key decided not to work in the middle of our stay. Someone was there right away to bring us new keys. The rooms were very clean, the beds and pillows were very comfortable for a motel.

8 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Better than I expected,We booked late and had no other options. On the plus side this is a more economical place. I based my rating as compared to other similarly priced places. We were pleasantly surprised in that our room (one of the ones at the back) was very quiet and very clean. Our 8 and 12 year old boys enjoyed the pool which was bigger than expected and surrounded by palms. I suspect that the room walls were thin and that we were lucky with our neighbors and that this is why there is such a discrepancy in the reports of how quiet the place is. We walked to and from Disney each day (take the short cut through Grand's lobby) It is probably too far for younger children or non-walkers. If booking here I would request an upstairs room at the back by the pool - as long as you can do stairs. These,January 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,967,308

The manager was nice enough to let us use his computer and printer to print out our boarding passes since they did not provide internet access.  We had no problems with any of the staff, they were all nice.  Cons: The cleanser they used smelled so strong, we had to air out the room and we asked them not to clean our rooms.  We just asked for clean towels and taking out the garbage only.  Beware when using the shower/sink, the hot water is scalding hot!  Also, when taking a shower, if someone else is using water, your water will turn very cold or very hot.
