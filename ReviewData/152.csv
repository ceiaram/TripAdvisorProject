The whiskey mai tai was sweet and sour but warmed my belly like whiskey is supposed to. The merman water was tropical, fruity and beautiful.

45 helpful votes,108 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location and a good price tainted by maintenance lapses,"I brought my family here as we wanted to check out the adjacent Doheny State Beach while still enjoying the comforts that come with a nice hotel stay. I found this DoubleTree to be a recently remodeled hotel with a laid-back beach vibe at an affordable price point for a holiday weekend (Memorial Day 2016). Based on what I observed during this stay, the hotel seems to be popular with families and groups staying in multiple rooms. Depending on your point of view, this may be a positive or a negative, but there were a few too many room doors propped open with coolers and back-and-forth hallway traffic for my taste. Its great location directly across the street from the campground at Doheny State Beach put the beach, picnic areas, and firepits within easy reach.

I was looking for an inexpensive place in this area for business travel, and couldn't resist choosing this place based on the price. It was easily $50/night less than the equivalent, non-beach properties that were somewhat closer to where I needed to be, but being on the beach (well, across the street from it) for $50 less per night was a no-brainer.  Check-in: Efficient, was given a room upgrade, and the room was clean and fresh.  Daily housekeeping service was done in time (a pet peeve of mine), and everything was clean.

We love the roof top terrace.  Great for a quick get away. The only draw back is the cost of parking.  The parking is owned by a third party and we think $22 is excessive for overnight parking.

We decided a hotel close to the beach would fit our needs best with the little time that we had.  The hotel's location fit our requirements quite nicely, as it is situated right across from Doheney State Park (the campground and nearby beach, particularly).  We were able to safely cross surface the road at a stoplight crosswalk, which made the beach much more accessible than we first thought it would be.  We did have to walk through the campground to get to the beach itself, but the walk was fine.  The view of the sea from our private balcony was also special.
