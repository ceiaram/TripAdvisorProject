I reset the settings to another channel, but after my return at the end of the day the ""power-on channel"" was back at Faux News. It wasn't the housekeeper; I had no housekeeping.  It's not the cable service - they don't automatically shift to a far-off channel (168) like that.  It's an overt decision by the ownership to put their politics out there. For them this is more important than their business.  To me that doesn't make sense. I will honor their decision and stay elsewhere next time.  There are a lot of other basic, dated motels to choose from that don't force their ideology down your throat.",October 2019,"They have a pool, but it's closed because of ""regulations"" according to the owner.",Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,450

Check-in was very easy and the women in office was very friendly and attentive. Room is very clean and housekeeping is excellent. Super great location! The room is no frills but comfortable.

I booked this property for my dad after reading a review that the owner is friendly and nice and I have to say that I didn't see that coming. The owner was extremely nice and make my dad feel welcome at the property. After he came back, he told me that the owner was very helpful and try to meet the request made. Also, the location of this place is the best! It was 5 mins drive to the beach and basically, this place is surrounded by iHop, Denny's, McDonald's, Walmart and Target and many more. It's very convenient :D Will be back for sure!",September 2017,none,Traveled solo,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,3,450

I was a little taken back at the ""old"" facilities and would have left if it was earlier in the day.  But, the room was clean and we were tired.  The only modern thing in the room was the TV!  Oh, they did offer free Internet, but I did not use it. Everything looked like it was from the 60's.  No iron or hair dryer.   Because of the cleanliness, bed comfort, location, and staff attention we stayed four days. I must mention that I was visiting my sister so I was able to use her iron and I always travel with my air dryer.",September 2017,"Although the motel is on the highway, it was quiet.",Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,450

Found this place but it's not exactly near the beach.  Upon check in, the lady at the desk quibbled over our BCAA membership that it wasn't AAA but finally gave us the discount anyway - and then charged us $20 cash for a key deposit.  Really? In this day and age?  Ah well.  It's right next door to an In N Out burger, which we wanted to try and not far from the freeways when we headed for LAX the next day.   Rooms were dated but clean, quiet and the Wi-fi worked well.  Not many extra outlets and a small flatscreen TV that didn't swivel or tilt bolted to the wall. The pool was closed.

The service is excellent, the staff are very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and clean.  It was a short drive to Huntington Beach and situated close to the freeway. There was free parking at the motel and free wifi.

45 helpful votes,119 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Standard Motel-acceptable,We had never stayed in an Inn in the USA so had nothing to compare this against. It was acceptable with nothing to rave or complain about. Everything was a bit dated but once again you get what you paid for. Location was good as a short 2 miles or 10 minute drive to Huntington beach pier and restaurants. I would probably stay closer to the beach next time. The proprietor was avery friendly Japanese American lady who runs it with her family. There are good family chain restaurants (Ihop) and standard shops very near  the Inn. Wifi was good. Very standard danishes and coffee at reception for breakfast.,May 2015,Above ground with view of your parked car,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,10,450

The rooms are clean and the people at the front desk are nice and friendlier than most places.  Free coffee in the morning, and the closest place to eat is an In & Out Burger which is right next door, and it is also next to a WalMart and several other decent places to eat.

It has a small pool, full digitial channels, room cleaning daily, fridge and free car parking. It was a perfect base for our trip however you need a car!!
