We were in room #138 on the 1st floor.  Room was nice and clean with tiles floor and had a little kitchenette in the back.  Free Wi-Fi which was great!  Very quiet at night.  Young and friendly staffs.  We will definitely stay here again.  Thanks Guest Inn!,July 2011,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,495

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst Hotel in Orange County!,"There are so many things wrong with this place it's hard to name them all. Let's start with the obvious. First, they advertise a ""Free Pool"", but it was closed for months with this sign posted. Now, it is filthy and has HORRIBLE PH levels; it is never cleaned. Second, they advertise ""High-Speed Internet"", but it is the slower than any any dial-up ISP I have ever seen. Furthermore, half the day, they have the internet turned off so that the managers can use all the bandwidth for their personal laptops. There is also a ring of prostitutes and drug-dealers that operate out of this hotel, but the Santa Ana Police Department won't investigate (probably paid off by the hotel owners). I wouldn't care about this point, but they are inconsiderately loud through all hours of the night",July 2010,none,Traveled as a couple,none,2.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,495
