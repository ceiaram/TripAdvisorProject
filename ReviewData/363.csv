They have one two-slot toaster, which is ridiculous.  I think all hotels should have the rotating toasters so several guests can be served at once.

It dropped a star this time and I will tell you why in a moment.  I first want to acknowledge Krista at the front desk who was very sweet and professional.  As a Gold Marriott she upgraded me to a one bedroom, quiet corner unit which was comfortable and appreciated.  The room was typical Residence Inn, clean and neatly appointed.  The other advantages of this location were the always free parking, close to John Wayne airport (free shuttle), free wi-fi and the Soup Plantation across the parking lot.

I chose this property because of its proximity to the university. It's also quite close to many regional/west coast headquarter offices for fairly well known companies.   I was warmly welcomed the moment I stepped into the lobby for check in. Check in was quick and once in the room felt relaxed and comfortable. Everything was spotlessly clean. Room temperature was easy to keep regulated and the windows opened for some nice fresh air. Great shower and all appliances were operating perfectly.  Breakfast was fantastic. Food was replentished often and area was kept clean.

I decided on this hotel because (1) it was pretty new, (2) I got a good price because of a friends and family discount, (3) you don't have to pay for parking, (4) it's right off of the 405 and also a close drive to Newport Beach, and (5) free breakfast every morning.  Check-in was efficient, and as requested, we were given a top-floor room. The room was fairly clean except for some stray hairs on the bed sheets. The view was unimpressive, as we just looked at a nearby apartment building and the smoggy sky over Santa Ana.   Breakfast was delicious and, best of all, complimentary.
