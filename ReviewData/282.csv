The breakfast could have had better options for the warm meal, it offered us biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and potatoes.  Which was good but id like some sausage and bacon added to that.

Hopefully your stay is better than mine was!",April 2020,none,none,"My apologies for my tardy response of more than a year. I will be the first one to let everyone know that we do not have microwaves in the rooms. Access to a microwave is available 24 hrs in the lobby, we have only 33 rooms so the distance from any room to the lobby is short. We are a basic Best Western and not a Plus or Premier which are required to have microwaves in the rooms. We have made a decision to not have microwaves in rooms based on the smell that would be left in the rooms. The mattresses were changed out during our remodel, we had received previous complaints that our mattresses were too soft. The secondary reason for changing the mattresses was to protect our housekeepers from injury as the softer mattresses were much heavier. The comment that irks me is the no breakfast. We are proud to advertise that we are one of the few hotels that not only remained open during the pandemic but continued to serve breakfast within the guidelines of the CDC, City of Orange, and Best Western.

I’m going to respond to each one of your complaints as best I can. California in general is an expensive state to visit and Orange County, CA is no different. Our rates are competitively priced to the area as we are sold out nightly. We have all the popular amenities among guests that non-resort hotels should have, for instance complimentary breakfast, free wifi, free parking, 24 hour front desk service, coffee in lobby, daily housekeeping. I am proud to say that our top three compliments are our staff, comfort of bed and cleanliness of rooms. The nights you stayed, the area had unusually high winds that made the news with uncontrollable L.A. fires. The winds were so high that last night you stayed, my backyard fence toppled over. What would have caused you to write that you would only pay $30 for a night with us? This baffles me as that would not even cover our cost to maintain the room and looking at Motel 6, they charge $60 - $70 weekdays in the area. I’m sorry that you did not like your stay at our property but I’m proud to say that we only charged you for two out of the five nights of your reservation. I adopt a customer friendly philosophy that if a guest is unsatisfied with their stay, they may check out without penalty.   The staff wishes you health and wealth in your future endeavors. I do not expect you stay with us again but I do hope you continue to stay with other Best Westerns.  Sincerely,  Michael Nuño Manager Best Western Orange Plaza",none,none,none,none,none,none,85,282

The first thing I noticed when reviewing your reservation is that you booked our ADA compliant room also known as our handicap room which explains the walk-in shower. I do realize this upsets you and if you did not need the handicap room it makes sense. Our website details each room, sometimes one may book our handicap room (not knowing that it is a handicap room) out of necessity because it is our only room available for date needed by guest or the details are over looked and the room is booked. We maintain a clean, comfortable and friendly hotel at all times.

12 helpful votes,37 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location and friendly staff.,I was in Orange to interview and audition for Chapman University. The location doesn't get much better. My only complaint about that is the homeless people that were literally 10 feet away from my room near the AT&T store. I'm not sure there's much the hotel could really do about that though. You also can see the Disneyland fireworks every night from your hotel room if you're upstairs. The room is pretty clean. It's definitely nicer than you would expect from a motel. The decor is updated. The only issue we had was the heat. The room would either be too hot or too cold. That issue made it hard to sleep at night. Maybe that was just a fluke with our room though.

Probably the best part of our stay was the surprisingly nice continental breakfast the following morning in the lobby, and the only reason I give this motel 3 stars. The accomodations themselves were fine, but needed major help in the the cleanliness department, however. The A/C was blowing out tiny damp gray chunks of something, accompanied with a very musty smell. I wondered how much of the ""gray yuck"" I had breathed in during the night. What was the worst though was the carpet. It was absolutely filthy by the door, and traffic area. Our feet were black after only 15 minutes in the room. I had to lay the throw blankets that were on the ends of the beds in a path on the floor; it was pretty",July 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,326,282

5 helpful votes,10 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hotel - Very Nice, Staff - Not So Much","While the hotel itself is friendly and welcoming, the front desk day staff leaves much to be desired.  I had called ahead of time to see if I was able to check in early, was told that it wouldnt be a problem. However, when I arrived, I was told that I had to wait until after 2pm to check in. The  desk clerk was not friendly at all, and certainly did not make me feel welcomed at the establishment.  When I originally checked in I was unsure of my length of stay. I stayed a total of 3 days, each morning going in to the office and paying for another night.  On the second day, the desk clerk's comment was ""Arent you going home yet?""  He was not kidding!!

Do not stay here. The person at the front is extremely rude. All I asked was a simple shower cap in the morning. He treats me like dirt, saying we ran out many weeks ago. If a hotel runs out of basic necessitites ""many months ago"", shouldn't they stock up? Asked him where Chapman University was, he says they shut it down, and doesn't exist anymore. Later, says that was just a joke! Doesn't understand when a customer is in not in a mood for a joke. The guy was a tall and hefty. I am short and meek. I'm the customer though, so he should treat me like a regular person, not his slave!  I go back later to checkout, and it takes eternity for his assistant.
