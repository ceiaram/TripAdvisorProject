It had no adjoining room and was a king size bed. I’d stay again. Hotel is a little odd but in a good way. “Garden” view with I guess a “river” is odd. Glass enclosure feel to the elevator is odd.

Rooms are large, some with views of the artificial ""lake"".  However, there is construction on this side of the hotel so be aware of the related noise during weekdays.  We were here to work, so we appreciated the adequate desk, lamp and work chair, plus the complimentary coffee machine in the room.  We enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant ,though the muzak can be extremely loud, and after-work drinks in the lounge that seems to be popular with locals even on weeknights.  Staff here was extremely friendly and accommodating.  It's a 10 minute walk to South Coast Plaza which was convenient.

The room was fine although the bed wasn't the most comfortable. The pool was quite small, and the layout of the hotel was awkward. The staff were very courteous and even helped me hop the hotel shuttle to the airport at a very early hour of the morning. The attached restaurant was a disappointment. You'll be happier walking to South Coast Plaza to enjoy some very good restaurants there.",May 2016,none,none,"Thank you very much for taking the time to provide us feedback in regards to your recent stay with us at Avenue of the Arts.

Glass walls in lobby showing waterways and plants and out the back a huge pond with walkway all around and ducks to watch. The rooms were modern and nicely appointed. TV a little small but good enough. Beds very comfortable. My only complaint was only coffee in room and my husband and I are tea drinkers.Usually hotels we stay in have both. Coffee also out on our floor by the elevator with assorted pastries which was a nice touch, although no tea there either. We were on an SPG Starwood guest floor--not sure if that is on every floor or not.  Also I hate paying separately for parking, though most hotels do these days. I feel if we are a guest of the hotel they should supply parking for you. I would rather pay more for the room and",May 2016,none,none,"Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback during your stay with us at Avenue of the Arts.

8 helpful votes,8 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Business trip with family,I stayed at this hotel while going to a training for work and I was fortunate enough to be able to bring along my husband and infant son with me. The hotel is updated and very clean. They have a great little pond behind the hotel that my son and husband were able to walk around during the day for entertainment. The hotel is also very conveniently located to a mall with lots of shopping and food options. The best part of this hotel though is the people. Every single person that works at this hotel is kind and courteous. They definitely make you feel like you are staying at a 5 star resort.

Sooo close to live theater, concerts, shopping, restaurants. Lots to do without ever getting in your car.      We tried the restaurant for dinner and breakfast.There were almost no choices for a vegetarian meal and the chef did not seem to be flexible enough to accommodate changes. My only complaint.   Breakfast on the patio was very enjoyable.       Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful.

We literally had two bills on both companies, and I was surprised at how easily and graciously they made the shift.  The location is great for a good central Orange County hotel. Close to all of the freeways, and just across the street from the South Coast Plaza.  They had fresh drinks and cookies in the lobby each day, and the staff always greeted us with a smile.  The rooms were clean and comfortable, and we would absolutely stay here again.",November 2015,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your stay with us at Avenue of the Arts!!
