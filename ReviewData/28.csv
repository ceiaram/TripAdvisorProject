Don't let the Costa Mesa or Newport Beach in the title fool you. This LQ motel is disgusting. The rooms are filthy with dirty linoleum flooring. Because it's a cheap hotel, you will also have a door connecting to your neighbor in the back. This will not be good if you're bringing pets. The main reason I book at La Quintas is because of their friendly dog policy. However, this place is awful if you have pets. The place is loud and crawling with vagrants. The staff was pretty rude.

none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Low Rent,"This was actually a Rewards stay.  I chose it this time over the nicer La Quinta on Hotel Terrace Way in Santa Ana, because it required significantly fewer points per night.  I'd driven by it probably 1000's of times, but had never stayed here.  First of all, it's an older motel.  That's not necessarily a deal-breaker.  Some of the La Quinta motels are quite nice, and being able to park near your front door can be a time-saver.  The rooms themselves had been updated, so not too bad inside.  My biggest issues were with the parking, the noise level, and with the cramped breakfast area.  The parking lot needs some work, and has an odd layout.  It's really tough to park near your room if you come in past early evening.

The highway wall was 30 feet away from our room door, so it was noisy all day, all night. The staff at the check-in was not helpful at all. The room was very small, old and dark. The bed sheets had wholes in them (see attached pic), the table was old, scratched, and squeaky. The sink was rusty as well as the bath tub (see pics). The hairdryer was old and it was missing a part at the back (see pic), so my hair got into the hairdryer - not good.

Several people mentioned it was ""noisy"" so I assume they were talking about it being next to the 405 Freeway.  However once you are in the room, there was no problem. I stay here primarily because I have 2 dogs and most places that allow pets have a 1 pet maximum so it was ideal for those with have pets. It is convenient to both Costa Mesa & Irvine with easy access to the 405 and 55 Freeways. I would definitely recommend it to anyone especially if you have pets! The staff was courteous and I was able to checkin early.  The room was clean and A/C was O.K. & you do have internet access in the room.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Overpriced Motel, not a Hotel","I paid 120.00 for a single room that was definitely not worth that much.   I kept trying to check-out on the TV as the menu on the TV said, when I called to ask for help, they said oh yeah, that doesn't work anymore, and they advised me to just get a receipt from the online booking program.  The fixings for the in-room coffee- maker weren't stocked, I called, they sent more around but left it outside without letting me know....had to call again and be told it was outside (and I mean outside, not in a hallway). Then the coffeemaker itself didn't work at all.  Free breakfast was over at 9:00 am which seems awfully early to me!  Also, this was MOTEL, not a hotel........room access is from the outside by the dark parking lot.  About three feet from the fwy.  Should have been MUCH",August 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,826,28
5 helpful votes,20 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Like sleeping on the freeway,"I would say that this La Quinta is not up to even the modest standards of the average hotels in this chain.  The location is central to shopping and other Orange County attractions, but the hotel is so close to the freeway (I-405), that the sound of traffic easily permeates the rooms facing that direction.  The rooms were reasonablely clean, and the staff met expectations for friendliness, but the breakfast was lacking in choices and the breakfast area was very cramped and usually dirty.  I thought we had gotten a great deal for this hotel, but due to the noise and lack of other amenities, I would not return to this La Quinta.",August 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,827,28
1 helpful vote,7 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Noisy,"NOISY NOISY NOISY.  Do not stay here if you plan on sleeping later than 6 am.  I turned on the fan, used earplugs, AND my iPod, and still heard road noise.  I am not a picky traveler, but this place is the WORST.  I wouldn't pay 40.00 a a night for this place, and the total charge was over $100 for one night.  Stay at the Super 8 in Santa Ana - lower price, and much quieter, same amenities.  Also, internet access was so slow that I couldn't even use it...",June 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,828,28

It had been a 28 hour Christmas (due to time changes) by the time our weary family of five stumbled into the hotel after midnight.  Robert was working and began going out of his way to make our stay what we needed.  Since we would only be staying four hours to sleep before our next flight, we just needed beds to crash in and this hotel met the need.  Granted, it was not exactly plush, but the bathroom was HUGE and the room spotless.  Robert arranged a wake-up call for 4:30 for us and called until he knew we were up.  He had also arranged for a cab to pick us up right outside our door.  We were very grateful for his smile and I'm not sure if we would have gotten the same",December 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,829,28
59 helpful votes,893 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,OK La Quinta,"We stayed for 2 nights at this standard La Quinta property, located just northwest of the intersection of the I-405 and Harbor Blvd. This location is excellent for shopping at South Coast Plaza, the mega mall is about one mile east of the hotel on South Coast Drive.  I’m a gold member of the La Quinta Returns frequent sleeper program (10+ nites per year). I would give this location an average to slightly below rating for the La Quinta chain. The building and interior is somewhat dated, the rooms are standard, ours was clean but slightly smaller than the usual La Quinta king room. The best thing about our stay was the $62 AAA nightly rate, a bargain for this geographical area. Be warned that the hotel is about 50 feet from the northbound San Diego Freeway and the traffic noise is",December 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,830,28
