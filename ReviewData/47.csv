none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Happy with our stay,"We visited Disneyland over 5 days in February. We stayed at BWPPI. Location is literally across the street from the entrance of DLR. Our room was clean and comfortable. It even faced the park. We were able to see the fireworks one evening. I especially liked being able to see Space Mountain while lying on the bed. Only downside was the road noise at night but that was no fault of the hotel. I have a bad knee and was able to rent an ECV in the lobby which was convenient. We attended breakfast on a few of the mornings. The space was clean. The staff friendly. Lots of hot items: eggs, French toast, bacon, etc. Plenty of fruit, cereals, breads, and juices. We were pleasantly surprised with our whole stay and would definitely return.",February 2023,none,none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,47
9 helpful votes,24 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,You Won’t be Disappointed,"Stayed here during a short Disneyland trip. Obviously the best part is the location. Three minutes from Disneyland gate to crosswalk across from the hotel. I never had the breakfast but drove by it when I was leaving and it looked a bit paltry. Pool is open, ground floor rooms hear the people above, unfortunately there’s nothing that can be done about that. Walking distance to a McDonald’s and a Panera. Room was spacious but the bathroom was tiny. Pretty decent sized refrigerator for a hotel. We’re staying again in a few weeks in one of the mini suites so we’ll see how the size difference is compared to a standard double room (two double beds). Parking is $15 per day and you’re limited to one car per room. There weren’t any USB ports in the room so bring your plugs! I will",July 2021,none,Traveled solo,Thank you so much for taking the time to tell us about your stay. We're sorry there were a few things that weren't completely up to standard.

Recommend staying the night before visiting Disneyland so you can eat a wonderful complimentary breakfast and quickly walk 5 min to the Disneyland entrance.

Hot breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes), bagels and bread with jams, peanut butter, and Nutella!, and yogurt containers. Grabbed a couple wrapped danishes, granola bars, and fruit to enjoy at Disneyland. The rooms are comfortable and spacious - we like the 2 beds plus sofa bed for our family of 5.

It also had a small microwave, small fridge and coffee maker. The bathroom was small, but really, you are only there for a bit, so it didn't bother us. The free breakfast next door was ok, I mean, nothing out of this world, but it was free, sooo. The only thing i didn't like was that the laundry room was getting repaired and we were unable to use it, which we really needed after several days of being on the road.

And the bathroom light switches were outside the bathroom (so is the vanity).

On one night, a trespasser had climbed the roof and began screaming at pedestrians and hotel guests.  Additionally, vagrants would walk around the premises.  My biggest complaint is that the rooms are not quite modern.  Bathrooms are undersized as door was two feet from the front edge of toilet.  There are no curtains in the rooms.  Slatted windows allow too much light in from street and exterior lighting.  HVAC had holes to expose outside.",July 2019,none,none,"Thank you for staying with us and letting us know of your concerns.For the safety of our guests, we do have security overnight.

But this Best Western is a hidded gem! Much closer than the Spring Hill Suites (so close, that when we or the kids got tired, we could pop over for a quick rest, then hit the parks again).

We knew that there would be a lot of walking involved and wanted to stay at a hotel that was close to minimize the walking. This hotel is right at the crosswalk to the Disneyland entrance and the price was right in comparison to other hotels that are near the entrance.   We stayed in a room with two queen beds. The room was average sized but the bathroom was very small (reason for the rating of 4 instead of 5). This wasn’t too much of an issue for us as we just took turns using the restroom/shower.

Yes, we are directly across the street from Disneyland however, our lot is only capable of hosting currently registered hotel guests.

As a courtesy we do allow guests to begin parking at 1 pm the day of arrival and remain in the lot until 3:00 pm the day of departure.  Unfortunately requests for early parking and later departures cannot be accommodated due to sheer volume received, which would take away parking from the currently registered guests who are entitled to a parking space.

Disneyland is about $105.00 per person, per day so families have to get there early and leave late in the evening to get their moneys worth. Therefore visiting Disneyland becomes ALL about, of all things, parking.  We chose the Best Western Plus Park Place Mini Suites for this very same reason. To be close enough to get to the gates first thing in the morning and, of course, the advantage of parking close.

Unfortunately our parking lot is only of sufficient size to house our current hotel guests.  Due to our location directly across from Disneyland, there is a high volume of requests for parking. Due to limited availability and to ensure all guests entitled to parking receive the same accessibility to our parking, restrictions are required. Check-in at our hotel is at 3:00 pm and departure is at 11 am. We do provide parking to our hotel guests beginning at 1 pm the day of arrival with an additional 4 hours of complimentary parking until 3 pm the day of departure.  After 3:00 pm we need to ensure we have availability for our arriving and currently registered guests.  Unfortunately due to the high volume and demand of the area and limited public parking options available, reliable opportunities for overflow parking do not exist. Our guests are guaranteed parking while a registered guest at our hotel.  In the interest of best customer service practices, we avoid creating circumstances which would require our registered guests, who are entitled to a parking space onsite, to have to find parking offsite in order to accommodate those who wish to be in our parking lot while a guest of Disneyland. I am pleased to hear you were able to find a neighboring hotel that was able to accommodate you during this visit. While I do understand the disappointment this may present for some visitors to the area, we do need to consider all guests of the hotel and ensure we are providing the same opportunity and accessibility to our facilities. Disneyland does provide parking for their guests and there is a parking structure about a 15 minute walk that does have hourly parking and is able at times to provide overnight parking at $24/day based upon availability.  I am very sorry this resulted in a negative experience during your visit, but do hope the explanation does provide you with a better understanding of our attempts to best accommodate and provide the same courtesies to all of our guests.",none,none,none,none,none,none,702,47

We have very limited parking. As explained when the request was made, we provide a four hour complimentary extension until 3:00 pm day the day of check out knowing many guests do enjoy the extra time. However we do ask our guests to leave by 3:00 pm to make room for our arriving guests. An additional 2 hours added to the four hour complimentary extension would then be infringing on the parking availability for our current guests and our incoming guests (who are guaranteed a spot at 3:00 pm).

Rooms above us had people running and walking loudly which just made our room unbearable at time.  Try and request a top floor room.  - American breakfast next door.

I am very pleased you enjoyed the accommodations and location.  I am sorry there was some confusion with your billing.  There was no error in the billing.  When you checked in, your credit card was authorized for the room and tax plus $30.00 for incidentals.  When you checked out,  the card was processed for the actual amount owed. So what you were seeing was the original authorization processed and then the actual charge that went through. They were actually one in the same, it just was not reflecting as such when you checked your balance that morning.  The credit card company fully processed the final transaction, reconciling the authorization with the charge.  When you originally made your reservation, which was not made directly through the hotel, it was set up as two separate reservations. This why the gentleman who checked you in did not realize right away that you were here for two nights. I do hope you see this posting and understand what occurred.

I am sorry you did not enjoy the room service provided.  Your concern is something that is addressed frequently so I will take the time to address the issue here. The majority of the time someone stays at a hotel, once they leave for the day they do not come back until the late evening.  Due to this guests, rarely see housekeepers cleaning rooms and do not realize that housekeepers work from 8am to 4pm. The rooms just happen to be beautifully cleaned when they come back.  Now we have a fantastic location directly across from the main access to the Disney Parks.  With that comes the convenience for our guests, the ability to come back to the hotel for a rest.  However, guests do not realize that housekeeping is still working to clean rooms.  Our hotel consist of 199 rooms that need various degrees of cleaning. They focus on the checked out rooms first to ensure those are ready by 3 pm for all arriving guests.  They try to get as many rooms ready as early as possible, for the multiple number of guests that arrive early to begin their visit to Disneyland. This does not mean they ignore the guests that are already checked in and will be staying another night.  They do have those rooms cleaned by 4pm. However, if our guests notify us that they are planning on coming back midday for a break, our housekeepers work diligently to ensure their room is ready for them so they can come back and rest.  Again I am sorry your room was not ready for you when you came back for a break.  But I am hoping this will help you and all others reading it, in having a much more relaxing stay at our hotel.

3 helpful votes,11 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great price, convenient location",I stayed here last November with my wife and four kids.The number one factor in my decision to stay here was the location. It is directly across from the entrance to Disneyland. The price was also pretty good. Probably the least expensive in the area. It is pretty much a motel as there are no inside hallways.  Two suggestions for anyone thinking of staying here: 1. Book early 2. DO NOT book through a third party website. Book directly through Best Western. Some poor guy who was checking in at the same time as me was told that he could not get a parking pass because he booked through a third party website.   The free breakfast was at Captain Kidd's buffet next door. They have a special dining area upstairs for hotel guests. It was gross.

I am pleased you enjoyed your stay and that you would stay with us again.  We do appreciate your comments and compliments.  I would like to mention that booking through a third party will not bar you from being able to park at the hotel. There is one international travel company that no parking is part of the contract and it is stated clearly on the guest's paperwork that they receive from the company. I am sorry you did not enjoy the breakfast. The food is not from the restaurant.  The food provided by the hotel is all name brand items (ex. Farmland Meats, Aunt Jemima Waffles, General Mills, Kellogg's, and Landers to name a few) that are found in households across the country.  We prepare the items every morning.

Not fancy in the least, but for our needs this place totally fit the bill. Price was right for a budget-conscious family of 5, including a toddler. We paid less than half what we would for a night at a Disneyland resort hotel. That's key. We wanted to spend our money inside the park, where we spent the majority of our 3 Disney days.

It is literally right across the street from the park entrance, it's inexpensive, and the rooms are decently clean for a motel (all rooms are entered from outside).

I was concerned about the parking policy, which states that you can't have your car in the lot until sometime in the afternoon the day you check in. But they called that morning (while we were en route to Disneyland) to confirm that we were still coming, and I asked them when we could park our car... and they said they weren't full so we could park right now!

We cater to families providing complimentary refrigerators, microwaves, breakfast, Wi-Fi, and business center services that would come with additional fees at many business oriented hotels.  However, a quick inquiry at the front desk could have provided you prompt assistance with your color printing needs or other assistance you may have required in preparing for your meeting.

I do apologize if you felt the gentleman that helped you was rude.  I did already speak with him on how he may have been able to better address your concerns.   Unfortunately you did arrive at 6:45 am with check in not guaranteed until 3pm.  Our previous night guests have until 11 am to check out and we did not have a clean vacant room ready that early in the morning.  Breakfast in the morning is prepared for guests who were registered overnight.    I do show however that the gentleman that assisted you did preregister you for your room.  This means he would have provided you your package while accepting the payment voucher and taking care of paperwork so all that needed to be done was for you to retrieve your keys when the room was ready.  He also provided you with a parking pass so you could park here instead of having to pay for parking at Disneyland prior to checking in to the room.  I am sorry if you felt you were being watched so you wouldn't eat.  Our front desk staff does not have view of the breakfast area which is in a separate building.  The breakfast area is controlled by a breakfast employee who has a list of current guests.  Again I am very sorry if you felt at anytime a member of our staff was rude or unaccommodating.

I am very pleased you enjoyed your stay with us, but very sorry you were disappointed with the parking.  Parking at the hotel is a privilege restricted to registered guests of the hotel due to limited space.  We do not offer Disney Parking for a fee to visitors because our hotel parking lot size is not conducive to this practice.  However, knowing that some of our guests do like to enjoy some time at Disneyland on the day of checkout, we do offer a four hour courtesy parking extension.  This allows guests who have checked out at the 11 am check out time, to park until 3pm at no additional fee.  The extension ends at 3pm so there is space available for the nights arriving and current registered guests.  Since we did make an accommodation and the registered guest parking ticket can not be extended, we did require you to push the intercom button on the gate machine so we could open it for you. I do again apologize for any disappointment you experienced. It is not a matter of charging for extended Disney Parking but ensuring that all registered guests are able to park their vehicle.

The breakfast is fine, nothing spectacular but hey, it's free! I have no complaints but I do have a couple of suggestions for the hotel since I know they read these reviews. 1.  Get better wireless. It is spotty at best. For me, free wireless is a selling point for a hotel. It should work all of the time and should have a good signal. 2.  The air conditioners are a bit loud.

If asked we could haved provided what the additional cost for extended parking would have been and also offered alternative locations.    The $10 parking fee is intended for registered guests of the hotel which is why that is the only rate mentioned on the website.  The non guest rates are not mentioned on the site because we do not offer public parking.  Our parking lot size is not able to accomodate Disneyland Parking as well as registered guests of the hotel.  The higher rates are in place to act as a deterrent to non guests of the hotel who prefer our lot due to its proximity to the main gates of Disneyland and California Adventure.

Unfortunately, if we did so, then spaces would not be available for registered guests returning for the evening, or for new arrivals.  However, knowing that some of our guests do like to enjoy some time at Disneyland on the day of checkout, we do offer a four hour courtesy parking extension.

When looking for a hotel, I was nervous looking at maps, because so many hotels appear to be close to the park.  I hate using buses because they're always crowded.  We chose the BW because many travelers on Trip Advisor said this was the closest hotel to the parks.    Indeed, it was the closest!  We walked out of our room, and the crosswalk to Disney was right there!  Once we crossed the street, we walked through the bus unloading zone (and further were relieved that we would never need a bus), bag check, and we were at the turnstiles to both Disneyland and CA Adventure!

So When my boyfriend and I went in December we thought it would be a great place to stay...boy were we Wrong. We got there late at night and the young man  and the desk knew Nothing! He as very rude. He asked for a credit card and said nothing about them charging it at the time. The breakfast was so terrible. Un-eatable and not worth the walk. The second day they called to tell us they needed another credit card and would deactivate our card until we brought them another one. We were at the park trying to enjoy our vacation we had saved for Years!  We took them another card and they charged that one as well ($400 on each card) and also deactivated the cards!,December 2012,none,none,I do apologize you did not enjoy your stay and were unhappy with the rate increase from what you originally reserved.  However the Best Western Employee Discount is reserved for current Best Western Employees.  The first authorization to the card was in place until you provided us proof of employement.  When it was determined that you were no longer a Best Western employee we did deactivate your keys and give you the option of paying the full price for your stay or checking out and finding a different hotel to stay in.  The second authorization was completed upon your agreement to staying at the standard rate.  Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further.

We wanted a safe, clean yet convenient place to base for Disneyland and California Adventures. Mission accomplished.    Pros: You dont need to drive to the parking lot and take a tram. You walk to the gates.  If you need to leave the park for some reason, it is do-able.  No, it is not a few steps, but as far as hotels go, it is as close as you can get.  The gift shop also sells a nice selection of jackets and pullovers for about half the price of Disney.  Next to an Ihop and walking distance to Mimi's and a few other decent eating choices.  Internet worked fine.  Cons:  Breakfast did not impress, but may be ok for some.  Parking now costs $7 a day.  Outside room noise a bit above average.

When a reservation is made through a third party prepay site such as Expedia, Walt Disney Travel or Get Away Today, to name a few, you are correct that requests are not guaranteed.  You are always much better off calling a property directly if you wish to be guaranteed certain bedding options.             When reserving a standard room on a third party site, the sites do mention that a standard room is either a room with one king bed and a sleeper sofa or two full (double) beds.  Both of these do accomodate 4 people.             If you made your reservation as a advanced full prepay directly on the Best Western website, you personally selected the room type you wished to be in and were provided with that room type.          The room you stayed in was a room with one King and a sleeper, comfortably accomodating a family with two adults and two children.

I am very sorry you had some issues with our property.  Having to wait for hours and place 3 phone calls to receive extra pillows is not acceptable.  I do also apologize for your keys demagnitizing.  Hotel key cards are very sensitive.  When kept next to cell phones or credit cards, they can become demagnitized.   We do wish we could improve the parking.  We did install the parking gates and started charging for parking to deter non guests so our guests would have a place to park.  Being directly across from the main entrance does make our parking lot a temptation for non guests.  We do try to accomodate visitors for a couple of hours but we do have to limit the time. The housekeeping carts are left outside certain areas until they are reloaded for the following day. They should not be left out overnight.  We will make sure that they are not blocking or making access to guests rooms difficult. We are continuously renovating or updating the rooms.  Every six months we address something in the rooms whether it is the bedding, furniture, painting, carpet, etc.  I am glad that you found your stay enjoyable overall.

I am very sorry you did not enjoy your stay with us.  We know the cost of a visit to Disneyland is extremely expensive and we do strive to make each of our guests stay enjoyable. I would like to take this chance to clear up a couple of misunderstandings.  The review mentioned the mini suite consisted of two double beds.  This room actually consists of 2 queen size beds and a sleeper sofa.  Also, while our pool is not as large as one may find in a full service property, 8 people maximum is inaccurate.  The 8 people maximum applies to the spa/jacuzzi, not the pool.  The pool occupancy is 21. I do apologize if the there was a strange odor in the restaurant and the food did not appear fresh.  Since we lease the space above the restaurant for the breakfast, you may have been smelling the food that was being prepared for the restaurant buffet served at lunch and dinner.  The continental breakfast items are served fresh daily with an option of hard boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, bagels, toast, pastries, cereals, oatmeal, fruits, juices, coffee, and milk. As with any breakfast bar, it is best to arrive as early as possible for the best selection.  As the breakfast hours are winding down, selection does become limited.   We did not choose IHOP because it is a full service restaurant and very busy.  Sending 199 rooms of hotel guests on a daily basis to IHOP for continental breakfast is not a viable option for us, nor a beneficial one for IHOP. Again I am very sorry your stay was not enjoyable.

We have three kids, 2, 6, and 9, and it was an easy walking distance.  We even came back for a swim early in the afternoon.  Our kids loved the continental breakfast, even more so then the Denny's down the street, which by the way was good.  Steer clear of",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3494,47
3 helpful votes,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Place - Very Close,"We were here mid-October 2004; this place was great, it was really close to the parks.  I think it was even closer than some of the Disney hotels.  The front desk folks were very efficient and helpful.  We got in very late and they were ready and waiting for us.  The rooms are nothing special, but they are spacious for a hotel room with a little sitting area.  The beds were confortable.  The room was clean and maid service was good.  For the price you really couldn't find a better place, the fact that it was so close really was the best feature.  The pool was OK, small, but I hear all pools in the area are small, except at the Disney hotels.  We had wanted to stay at a Disney hotel because being in walking distance was a must for us!

We stayed at this hotel at the suggestion of co-workers who had stayed here in the previous weeks and really enjoyed it.   Having been to Disneyland several times before and staying at different places in the same area we were really impressed.  First of all the location doesn't get any better - you are literally right across the street from the main entrance of the park - just a short walk away.   The hotel was very clean and the rooms were a good size - we had a king size bed plus a small sofa and coffee table along with microwave and fridge.  The front desk staff left a little much to be desired - not very friendly but were efficient and helpful nonetheless.

We never used the pool but it was very small.  In our room we found that the shower had very little pressure.  We asked for maintanence to check it and it was fixed before we returned from the park that day.   The one thing they never fixed was the smell of smoke that we had in our room daily.
