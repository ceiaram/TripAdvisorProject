19 helpful votes,22 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Awesome place to visit.,Four Seasons Pacifica has never been disappointing. Very nice place to stay with clean rooms and great views. Sunsets are the best. This is the 3rd visit and it was absolutely awesome. Just a couple minute walk to the ocean and maybe a 5 minute walk to the dock. Couple good places to eat there as well. Walking distance to the shops downtown San Clemente is maybe a 10-15 walk.,March 2022,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,427

I've spent a week at both this year and had a fantastic time every time. The staff are all super friendly and most helpful, the rooms are clean, super spacious and provide everything you would need and both locations are close to the beach with amazing views from the room.

Park your car in the garage and enjoy the short walk to restaurants, shops, or to the beach. This roomy two bedroom has everything you could ask for.

The unit was extremely spacious and well appointed. It had a full kitchen with everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The location is outstanding, just a short walk to the beach and pier as well as into town with shops and restaurants within walking distance.

From the easy checkin process to the luxurious and huge accommodations, we were impressed by every detail. The rooms were large, the beds very comfortable, and the full kitchen complete with dishes, pots, pans, utensils, toaster, coffee pot, and even a dishwasher. The staff was extraordinary and ensured our needs were met. Our room was spacious and clean, and we felt comfortable and safe, even amid the COVID pandemic. The unobstructed ocean view from the balcony is spectacular with the beach just a short walk from our unit.

Rooms were very clean and up to date. Definitely will come back for even a longer stay. Management is top of the line.

There was not one thing that was missed when it came to them providing everything!!!!  The kitchen was immaculate and the living room spacious!!!!  The set up was perfect!!  The 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms were more than enough room with all 3 of us!  We never felt crowded at all.  It is close to so many cute shops, restaurants, beaches, and wine tastings!!!!  It is quiet , yet the area is active.  Runners, dogs and surfers were visible when you looked out over balcony and when went outside.

It is in a quiet residential area with only 5 units, all of which were empty except the 3 bedroom on the top floor (3rd) where we strayed. The unit was very specious with 3 large bedroom and 3 baths. The decor was retro 50s, but completely upgraded with open beam ceilings, huge travertine fireplace with gas lighter, a wonderful balcony with seating for 4 and a gas BBQ which overlooked Linda Lane Park and the beautiful Pacific Ocean.

19 helpful votes,22 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Where do i start,"Checked in on a Friday evening. As always, curious about what the room would be like. It was probably one of the best rooms, if not the best rooms we have stayed in. It was beyond clean and very well maintained. Had its own garage for vehicle to be parked in overnight. Beautiful walk to the ocean front to watch a couple awesome sunsets. So many choices of food within a 5-10 minute walk. My only regret was to not stay longer. Could easily spend an extended amount of time there with no problem. No issues checking in. The manager there was very helpful in making decisions on what to do during the stay, as there are so many options. Again, had an awesome stay with the only complaint of not staying longer.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice but HOT!,"We did a Interval International trade with this property, and while we did all our research regarding the units, we were disappointed there was no air conditioning!  I called ahead of time inquiring as to why there was no air conditioning in the units, and I was told with the ocean breeze we wouldn't need it. Well, that was far from true. It was miserably hot in the unit the entire week. Even at night. So if you are interested in coming back to a nice cool unit after a fun day out in the city, don't stay here.

The views are wonderful, the BBQ on the balcony produces some wonderful dinners and walks and swims at the nearby beach are refreshing.

Great beach access, with a lot of nearby restaurants & shops. Pool & resort facilities are about 1.5 miles away, slight inconvenience but very nice facilities!   Biggest complaints: Automatic lights in the bathrooms, unfortunately I am one of those people that can't make it all night without a bathroom break which is bad enough, but getting blasted with bright light makes it worse!! When you shut it off your movements turn light back on. We shut the ""guest bath"" door at night because the sensor would pickup movement in the mirror.  Unit could use a few more items such as a cooler & scissors.  No ice machine on site, but available at the main resort. All of this is minor stuff!

The beds were comfortable and the kitchen nicely stocked. There was more than enough room for the four of us. The view of the sunset every night from the balcony is beautiful.  I loved the sound of the distant trains at night and the fact that you can walk to the ocean. There are beaches for surfing and a park right across the street for smaller children. So many restaurants are close by and one of my favorites, Fisherman's, is right on the pier, within walking distance of Four Seasons/Pacifica.

There are a total of six units, each with a different name and slightly different floor plan.  We stayed in the ""Miramar"" unit, which is the first floor corner unit, most accessible from the street.  Initially, we thought the higher view units had an advantage.  However, we quickly redirected our prospective and respect for the first floor unit as we watched the calm nature of the community enjoying the adjacent park and stroll ways.
