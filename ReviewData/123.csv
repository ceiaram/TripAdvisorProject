All of the staff said hello and regularly asked if they could help us with anything.  They were very accommodating.  The rooms are a decent size.  The free wi-fi worked well and there was no charge for parking (versus $25 at many other hotels in the area).  We only ate breakfast there and it was fine- not extraordinary but the buffet was a good value.  They didn't seem to have movies or TV shows on demand which was a bit of a disappointment for my 13 year old daughter.  I would definitely stay there again.

We were greeted and checked in quickly. Upon checking into our room we were surprised by the size of the room. We have small children so we prefer a bathtub. We were told that would be additional. The next morning my husband and oldest went down for breakfast because our youngest was still asleep. He was told he could not bring the food he paid for back up to the room. We woke up our son and took him down for breakfast. Once down there we watched 2 separate guest pay for and take their food to their room.
