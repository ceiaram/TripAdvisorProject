none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,good value,The staff was very helpful.  we had a couple minor glitches and they were able to help right away.  the price was reasonable.  my only recommendation is to replace the waffle maker and make the batter the right way.  the batter was runny and the waffles were goo after 2:30 minutes.  the rooms were clean and quiet away from the street.  the bathroom was clean.  the place was freshly renovated ...we watched the painters finish touchups on the doorjams....good work.  curtains and carpets were in great condition.  crown moulding was a nice touch.  location is good.  a little away from the bustle of the resorts but still close enough for a 10-15 min drive to Knotts or Disneyland.,July 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,186,382
none,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Safe area, clean room, comfortable bed, Filthy bed linens","We stayed for 3 nights the end of October 2011. The hotel staff member was pleasant. The room was clean but the bed linens were filthy. The gentleman at the front desk was apologetic when informed of the situation. I asked for new bedding and the gentleman did help but they did not have one clean blanket or comforter, only sheets.(???)  I was offered to switch to another room which upon inspecting the bedding was dirty as well. I decline that one, (we had quite a bit of luggage) got new sheets and toughed it out. To sum it up, Staff was pleasant, Room was clean, Bed was comfortable, Area was safe, Breakfast was decent, Price of room was so-so, Linens were fithy.",October 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,187,382
36 helpful votes,79 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very comfortable motel,"We have stayed in this place several times since it was renovated about 2 years ago. The rooms are still pretty good looking, and offer your usual motel setting: everything in the rooms worked, including the free wireless internet. The staff is efficient. The breakfast is in a small room that after a few guests will have an untidy appearance, that could be improved. The pool is very tiny and not favourably situated. Sometimes some of the guests are a bit rowdy, staff however does not intervene. That is definitely a downside. Otherwise a clean and decent place for a decent price.",June 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,188,382
3 helpful votes,13 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Unfriendly non-existent staff!,"I cannot believe this place! The staff was like a drone. No personality what so ever. They put us in the darkest room in the very corner of the building.  It was obvious there were other rooms available. There was a cockroach in the bathtub. Every time anyone around us who use a plumbing fixture it made the loudest noise that would wake you from your sleep. The staff was hardly at the front desk you had to go hunt them down. They would leave the office door open so they could hear the phone ring, consequently everyone else in the hotel could too!  The drain in our shower was clogged and when we reported it they said they would have the maid look at it. Later they told us that the maid said it was fine?

But when we came at 6:45 am, the lobby was locked and empty, and we had to ring the bell for a while before a man came to the window and told us that breakfast starts at 7 am.

97 helpful votes,51 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fine stay, but limited breakfast","This was a good, solid hotel with what I'd consider a spacious room for the price.  It appeared to be newly remodeled and was nicely laid out for business work.  I was a bit skeptical whether it would be quiet based on the long, covered walkway along the second floor rooms.  I feared that the sound of rolling suitcases and thumping feet would be bad, but I never heard anyone else.  Based on its proximity, it seems like a logical place for families going to Disneyland to stay but either there was no one there when I was there or they were amazingly quiet.  The parking lot was half full each morning so there were definitely other guests in the hotel.  The staff was extremely friendly.  My only complaint was what I'd call a ""poor"" breakfast.  There were only 2 types of cereal.",February 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,197,382
none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Extremely Pleased!,"We went for a funeral and this hotel was close to Forest Lawn Cementary in Cypress, Ca.  It was just myself and my husband and we reserved a king size bedroom.  I was very pleased from the very beginning with the whole hotel experience.  We were checked in at 6:30 pm by a very nice and personable young man.  The check in was very smooth and the room easy to find, especially for us older persons who get a bit confused easily.  The room was very clean and smelled clean too.  The bed was the most comfortable and the top cover/comforter was the best.  I am looking in department stores for a comforter just like it.  The only negative and it is a very, very, small negative is the complementary breakfast....it was kinda ordinary.
