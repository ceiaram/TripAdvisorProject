This park is basically a glorified parking lot.  It suited us just fine as we planned to spend our entire time at Disney which is less than a mile away.  The shuttle is convenient to use instead of driving there.  It was a bit overpriced considering the lack of amenities, however I understand it was close to Disney and therefore a convenient location.

Cons: #1: The traffic noise was HORRIBLE.  We didn't get much sleep.  The spots nearest the road should be deeply discounted and people should be warned if they are assigned these spots so they can prepare.  #2: We were given a double spot for our little pop-up tent trailer and charged double.

I apologize for the negative aspects of your experience that you listed and will try to address them all:  #1: The spots closest to Harbor blvd can indeed get loud at times and we usually let our guests know this ahead of time. I apologize you were not informed at the time of your booking. We are currently growing our hedges at the entrance to provide as much of a buffer from the road as possible. If being so close to Disneyland has one drawback it is how busy the roads can get.   #2: When guest check in with us we go over how many sites they were given and why. If you were given two sites it was most likely that both the trailer and the pull vehicle would not fit into the same site. As for the cost, the additional site for the pull vehicle is $6 per night. We let our guests know it is a prorated system and they are not being charged the same amount for each site given but I apologize if we didn't cover this with you.    #3: It is the city code that the pool must be locked at all times and require a key to ensure the safety of all the children at the park. We will however make it more known to the guests that they must ask for a key at the office.   #4: While we do have a fifth shower in the handicapped bathroom that we allow patrons to use, your comment about asking guests to try to limit their shower time will definitely be taken into consideration.

We also have security cameras so perhaps if you will tell us which space you occupied, we can review the security cameras also. We apologize that the playground photo was still shown on the site - we just recently replaced the playground with grass, picnic tables, umbrellas and a BBQ - the photo was removed from our website but wasn’t removed from TripAdvisor.

It is a concrete RV parking lot, with a tiny bit of dirt and sparse grass between the restrooms and the arcade which is too small to fit a RV. And thus, the ""campground"" was born.  At $40/night, you are paying for a tiny amount of ground to pitch your tent onto. There is one picnic table to be shared between the three sites, and you have zero privacy.
