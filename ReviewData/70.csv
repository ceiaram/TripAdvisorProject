Parking is somewhat reasonable. Free breakfast.  The only reason I rank this hotel 3 out of 5 is because it just needs a few tweaks to make it to 4 stars and, in my opinion, a returner.

It's less than 15 minute walk from the park and several places around to eat. There's a pool, restaurant on site, and the breakfast is included with your reservation. Now, on to the issues. There is literature that claims complimentary parking for hotel guests, but when I was checking in, they asked me to pay for parking. Good thing I didn’t drive a car or keep my rental for the duration of my stay. After checking in and taking occupancy of the room, the toilet we tried to use wouldn’t flush.

We rented a car for two of the days we were there and the free parking was a very nice amenity. 3) Conveniently located car rental. National (and Avis?) were located right next door.

Very limited choices, extremely bland, undercooked and highly processed. After the first time visiting the 'buffet' we chose to eat down the road at either Denny's or The Cheesecake Factory.

We stayed there for a week and our room was in desperate need of a renovation.  The carpet was awful and really should have been changed several years ago.

The location was perfect walking distance for a family of four with two kids who were so excited to get to Disneyland.

Things I liked: - Good location with reasonable food options nearby - Pretty good breakfast -Free internet ( the Sheraton still charges) - Small pool - The hotel was spotless  - Close to a 7-11 which has 2 pizzas for $10! - Free business center - Free parking  The only thing I have is they charged us a 'resort fee'. The hotel should just include this into the price. This is not the 4 Seasons on the Beach c'mon. We paid $130 per night. Another small thing was that non of the cleaning staff spoke a word of English. Overall we liked this hotel.

Here is my unbiased and honest review (Keep in mind I have worked in the hotel industry for many years so I am very detailed):  Location: One of the closest hotels to Disney (walking distance). We could see in to the park from our room and we had an amazing view of the fireworks at night. Hotel is next door to a 7-11 which is convenient for snack runs without having to drive.  Rooms: Hotel offers standard guest rooms as well as suites catering to families. We reserved the ""Borrego Suite"" which slept 6. This was a large room with a sunken living room area that had a full size sofa sleeper.

Negative things: There were no curtains and the blinds let the light into the room. I hate being woken by light. Our room in ground floor had the view of the parking. In this parking there was a car with a very sensitive alarm. Every night we ""listened to the music"" of the alarm sounds. Really annoying.

After you buy the Disney tickets, you want to be sure you have good value in your room.  And this is the place.  Located quite a ways from the Disney hotels, you only have a short walk to the main entrance on the other side of the park.  So that's a plus.  You also have restaurants and convenience stores right there, which can be a blessing.  You can walk to anything you need, including local rental car places or the convention center. The rooms are large, well-appointed and have everything you need.  The breakfast is free and it is a hot breakfast, including some great make-your-own waffles.

If the walk home is too far for little legs you can get a shuttle for a small fee that stops right outside the hotel. We stayed in the kalahari suite. We travelled with 5 of our children aged between 2 to 17. we found we had enough room and it was clean and comfortable. The kids loved the pool although it did get rather busy just after the parks closed. The staff were more than helpful at all times.  The breakfast was fine all kids found something they liked. The room does get very busy though so some days we just skipped breakfast.

There was a shared bathroom in the middle with two sinks and two separate showers and toilets (which was also convenient as we could have one adult bathroom and one kid bathroom).

I walked into the children's room which has bunk beds to see if it's any better. We walk in and see a dinky little room with a dust speckled bunk bed & a ripped up orange couch.
