The suite was a little cramped but had all of advertised amenities.  Our room #340 was very comfortable & quiet notwithstanding its proximity to the 405 fwy.  The furnishings were relatively new & well kept.  We had a small balcony which made the room feel a bit larger.  The staff was very welcoming & the wifi worked well.

Filthy, stained, crusty, odors from Hell's Waiting Room, and just run down. Previous reviewers have mentioned the list of terrible things that await a guest.

This hotel is a good mile or more from the beach, across a huge freeway, and it sits up on a hill. Their plumbing is shot and leaking.  2. Hallways to the rooms have carpeting from 1988. Soiled and stained complete with cigarette burns.   3. My room's carpeting was so grimy and filthy, that there was no way I was going to walk around without shoes.

Given the relatively high price, I was disappointed. The check-in staff was polite but not friendly. The room and bathroom need updating, the sofa bed was grubby looking and a little lumpy, the sheets were very thin and one had a hole in it. The top blanket on the sheet also looked very worn and I avoided touching it..... I tried to leave my shoes on in the room. The location is all right (close to San Onofre ), the pool is decent (kind of small but it was clean), the breakfast was just ok.

The desk lady was really great. We were traveling with an 18 month old who was hungry when we checked in, so the desk lady got her some items from their continental breakfast.  We were charged $10 for the crib, which was the only hotel we stayed at on our 8 day trip that charged us for the use.  The breakfast was OK,",May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,253,317
4 helpful votes,30 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,A rip off,I reserved two rooms at this motel for the end of March 2006.  I went online and canceled the reservations and was still charged for two rooms for one night.  I called the motel and the manager was very rude and helped other customers while I was trying to talk to him.  He wasn't helpful at all.  I would never stay at this motel.  I had been warned that they are weird.  I should have listened.,May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,254,317
6 helpful votes,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very Nice!,I stayed at this hotel in May and early June of 2005.  Other than the night clerk being rude when we checked in everything was very nice.  The room was clean and the maids did a good job every day of cleaning for us.  The pool and hot tub were very nice and the atmosphere was very nice.  Rather hispanic. There are a lot of blooming plants around the hotel that make it feel very like you are in spain or mexico.  I am from Michigan so I was impressed by that.,May 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,255,317

I am spreading the word because I have never been treated so awfully.  We checked in and found one of two beds unmade, and the other bed had a coffee table on top of it.  The room was full of paint fumes from the two rooms right next to it being painted at the time.  There were still open paint cans and wet brushes.  This hotel was big enough and with enough vacancies that we should not have been next to wet paint.  We stepped onto the ""balcony"" which was no more than 2 feet by 2 feet and over looking the back parking lot.  That is where we found empty beer cases and used HYPODERMIC NEEDLES thrown on top of the storage container.  Obviously these had been thrown here by the previous occupants of this room.",September 2005,none,none,"I regret that you have a bad experience with our property.

My room had a small fridge and microwave and very small balcony which all added to the value.  The pool and hot tub seem to be pretty decent.  A complimentary continental breakfast is also included.  The hotel served my purpose of a place to rest after days of surf.  It's quiet and conviently located.  There may not be a lot of frills, but it's worth a price of around $60-$80.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,258,317
