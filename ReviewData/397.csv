When you looked at the lights they were coated in dust and dirt. Only one bulb worked in the bathroom. There was a lot of dirt and hair behind the door like it hadn't been vacuumed or swept in weeks.

Little Boy Blue doesn't have fancy extras or facilities but it does have a spacious and well laid out room, free parking, a comfortable bed and a good night's rest. 15 minutes walk took us to the gates of Disneyland and 5 minutes took us to very nice eateries at Anaheim Garden Walk.  The room is dated, for sure, but we spent almost no time in it.  Our belongings were secure, the room was clean and we were well rested.  The only thing I miss, and this is so minor, is a coffee facility in the room. There is a microwave, which is no doubt very useful to some, and a very useful fridge/freezer.

Firstly,  we booked this hotel online,  mainly because of it’s price.   At something like $66 a night,  we were obviously not expecting some fancy place,  but ,  with the condition of the rooms at Little Boy Blue,  we now feel like they should have paid US to stay there.   I have backpacked all over Europe,  and stayed at some cheap hostels that had better conditions than this.   The location is pretty great if you are going to Disneyland,   about a 10 minute walk.  There are little shops,  like a 7/11 and a few restaurants nearby.     The first room we were given was on the ground level and at first glance looked clean.

It is one of the few remaining 1950 - 60s 'mom & pop' hotels which used to dominate the area.  (Most were torn down to make room for Calif. Adventure.)  Staying there brought back memories of when my parents took me to Disneyland.  It allowed me to pass on some historical and cultural information to my college-age son.
