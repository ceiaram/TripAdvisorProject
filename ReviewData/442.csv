2 helpful votes,4 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Being in the trailer took me right back to my childhood ðŸ™‚,"We love SC state beach and the adorable vintage trailers had been on our wishlist for a while! We got lucky and booked all 4! Owners were easy to reach and very helpful! It was great having all the essentials right there in camp, too! We brought our bikes, had a couple of great beach days, and fun by the fire at night. Highly recommend this for your next camping trip!",May 2021,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,442

It's effortless kind of camping because all we brought was some clothes and food to BBQ.  The RVs are fairly new and in awesome condition with a good size fridge and stove top.  My daughter enjoyed the bunk bed in the RV.  The holidays is an awesome and effortless option for families that are looking for a quick get away.,March 2016,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,442

The trailer was fully stocked, so we just showed up with food and clothes. There is a shed full of games too!  My 2 year old son loved riding his bike around the campsite. The beach is a short walk from the trailers.  We can't wait to come back!",July 2015,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,442
