I had difficulty finding the location and reached out to the hotel. The representative was extremely rude on the phone indicating there was no medical center nearby and he had a customer in front of him saying, ""you need to hold on."" Essentially, the customer who had just arrived was more important than me, who was lost on the phone. Turns out, the medical complex I was in was directly next to the Days Inn (Harbor Inn) motel. Upon arrival and check in, I realized the door was broken and wouldn't shut all the way. There was also a very strong cleaning/chemical smell that was truly overpowering. It smelled like a strong carpet powder had been spread all over the room.

The TV color was off and the settings were unable to be changed because the remote only controled the sattelite box. There was a line going right through the middle of the screen.
