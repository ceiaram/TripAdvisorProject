It's a 60s style motel and they've tried to make it more appealing, but it's putting lipstick on a pig. They've put in more modern furniture, but it's still a 60s style motel.  Asked if they had a corkscrew and they said we'd have to come down and use the only one they had. Not a deal breaker, but emblematic of the place.

The pictures of the rooms and location made it appear good. However, we were disillusioned when we arrived to our room.  First of all, you can tell that the hotel needs some renovating to be done, and the worst of it was the ant problem in the hotel. I have never experienced that at a hotel before.  I know it had been raining a lot the past week, thus the reason for the ants, but you would think the hotel would be aware and make sure that all rooms have been cleaned and sprayed for ants.

She didn't try to offer me anything like adding a rollaway bed for my son, or try to help.

Not even a single B&B you’d expect in a tourist town. This need is scheduled to be filled when a new hotel is finished in 2019. But for now your best bet is the Best Western. Not that this is a hardship. The BW Capistrano is comfortable, well-maintained and scrupulously clean. The free breakfast is exactly what you’d expect from a chain lodging, or even perhaps a little more varied. The location is convenient to the Mission San Juan Capistrano, even if it isn’t scenic.

After required investigation of the guest room from the report, no insects were discovered and the report was cleared, the room was serviced and sold that evening. The insect you did provide us was either an Agromyzidae or a Xylophagidae fly.  If bedbugs or flees are ever discovered, hotels have required procedures to exterminate.  On Monday morning ""Labor Day"" at checkout Guest Services Manager Amber discounted 2 of the room charges, as you mentioned.

Because the BW Capistrano Inn is an exterior corridor hotel, flying insects can gain access if not closely monitored by staff and guests.
