They came to put another battery in and it was another bad battery.  They finally just took it out after i requested it so I could get some rest.  Never got back to sleep.

2 helpful votes,11 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Dirty, Smelly, NEVER, EVER again","I would NEVER stay here again. We checked in late in the night, after 9pm. The front desk guy was nice and friendly. Did the normal check in as most hotels do. We went to our room, dropped off our stuff and took off for an already scheduled event. That is where we made our mistake. Upon entering the room, there was an odd smell but we just opened the window, in hopes that would fix, it and left. We also noticed stains on the comforters but figured we just won't use them. We did not get back to the hotel until after 230AM. Getting back into our room, we noticed things weren't up to par. The smell was of urine and leaving the window open did nothing to get rid of it. We went in to use the bathroom and noticed the floor had hairs all over it.

It was unclean, and by unclean I mean that you cannot trust that housekeeping changes the sheets between guests and there was a urine stain on the bathroom floor in one of our rooms.  It is also in a rough neighborhood full of dive bars.  Here was my experience: Check-in:      Lobby was okay, but I was immediately taken aback by the fact that the front desk staff was sitting behind a glass wall and you have to push your ID and credit card through a pass through like at a drive up bank teller window.

Although Disneyland was not in our plans it is located less than 3 miles from Disney and was competitively priced for the area. It is a one level motel with easy access to the room. It has been completely renovated so the rooms are very clean and modern. It was quite a comfortable stay. Our room had hardwood floors, a fridge, a microwave, and a desk. There was not much nearby as far as restaurants to walk to but there were many choices nearby using our car.

6 helpful votes,11 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mixed bag,"Short version: Looks great, but is short on amenities and lacks some functional things needed to make the room comfortable to do more than sleep in. The neighborhood seems sketchy at first glance, but, after a couple of days there, we actually felt the neighborhood, while run down some, was reasonably safe.  Longer version: This hotel is clearly older in construction, but has been very tastefully remodeled. Everything shown in the photos is reasonably represented. What looks good looks great. Parking is literally right outside the room and is free. The WiFi was easy to connect to, and was adequate to our needs. We did stream one TV show at one point and it had no issues.

Parkside Inn popped up when I was searching, and the pictures of the rooms and rain shower is what caught my attention.  I was hesitant at first because it was a motel, and we only like to stay at hotels.  Since we were going to be doing many parks and activities, I liked the price and what I would be saving by trying this place out.   Let me say that this place is a hidden gem!  They have 4-star customer service.  The rooms are immaculate.  They have all the amenities of finer hotels: coffee maker in room, blow dryer, ironing board and iron.
