We had booked a basic room using points and were offered an upgrade as Ambassador elite. We were then able to pay a small fee to upgrade to an even better two-room ocean view suite with a fire pit. A must! Totally worth it to have that experience. The sunsets were breathtaking. The room was massive and had two bathrooms, both of which were spacious. There were smores kits and coffee makers in the room along with mini fridges.   We walked down to the beach all 3 days and called for the shuttle to come pick us up at the beach shack.

The hotel lobby, lounge and restaurants are beautiful. In particular, sunset at 180Blu is spectacular. While we didn't try the two restaurants, Raya and Enosteak, neither was busy during our stay.  The views from the property are amazing.  The beach is a bit of a walk from the hotel down from the cliff but the hotel runs a golf cart-type shuttle on a regular schedule (but you can also call them directly for a ride).  Beach is well maintained and its great to watch all the surfers.  The resort has two pools but I would call them below average for a 5 star hotel.  It's clear the view and the beach are the stars at this resort. The club lounge was hands down the best part of the resort for us.

We stayed overnight in August, driving down from LA to Dana Point with our two little children, eagerly awaiting some relaxing time.  Having stayed here in the past.  Unfortunately, the hotel was completely overwhelmed, due to a combination of covid restrictions and poor planning.    Since the restaurants weren’t allowed to be open for service, there was one long line at the cafe (over one hour) and a two hour wait for room service.   The line for the outdoor bar wrapped thru the hotel.  In essence, we were told that our best option was Uber eats.

8 helpful votes,4 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointing,"Wow. Incredibly underwhelming. I’m not going to comment on their service during the pandemic because I think they’re actually managing that fairly well—staff was attentive and responsive.  But here’s the thing: you can’t charge full fare ($1000/night in our case) when restaurants, fitness facilities, concierge lounge and spa are all closed.  Also, room service food was good but served in paper bags with plastic utensils. Even without the pandemic this RC is not worth the money. We had an ocean view room. View was great, room dated and small. Also, curiously, there was very little furniture in the room which made it uncomfortable to hang out in. One club chair and a desk chair. No table or sofa.

There's also no one to do chair set-ups at either pool--which is fine but not very Ritz like. Since the beach is a public beach, there are no nice lounge chairs at the beach, though the staff is happy to lone you little folding chairs and bottled water.

Room is very average and only from 3rd try I  managed to get us a room that was good to us... They tried to put us far from main pool and from everything... I'm 8,5 months pregnant with 2y.o. and 4 y.o., so we really just wanted to be closer to main pool and on the first floor. Nothing else.  Not even ones we received turn down service...

Check-in was thorough and the desk agent took the time to explain the resort to us. The only blimp in our entire 4 day stay was our first few minutes…..she  listed our amenities as a FHR Platinum Amex reservation which included space available upgrade. When I asked her if there were any upgrades available she looked and said “ no”. A minute later as the welcome monologue continued she asked us if “we would like to upgrade our room” with the implication there would be a rate increase if we did. It was a little off putting and confusing to be told no Amex upgrade but then offered one if we were to pay for it.       We were in a club level coastal view room.

How about the RItz website that had promotions ending the previous December but still had not been updated by mid January?

This year our conference was down the street at the Ritz.  The staff was super friendly. Our bellman who took our bags to the room was the most friendly and informative bellman I have ever met.   The food was very good especially the breakfast.  The workout facility was nice and it looked over the water.  It seemed a little more reasonably priced for dining than what I remembered the Montage to be.   Will definitely go back.,January 2017,none,none,"Thank you for sharing your five-star feedback.

The facility itself needs an update, however, and no level of wonderful staff can compensate for that. Little things that you notice- all the baseboards and trim were DESTROYED in our hallways and room. They have been repainted (without sanding and clearly with dirt underneath) many many times, and it just looks bizarre. The bathtubs are difficult to get into if you're even moderately short, and the balcony furniture was old and falling apart.

The hotel is very nice but not worth the price. The rooms are quite small and although they are comfortable, they seem to be lacking a little. It's a bit like they tried to take an average hotel room and make it upscale. I'm certainly not complaining it's still better than 90% of the hotels out there, I'm just not sure it's worth the money. Some of the positive notes - the food was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. The pool bar does close at 2pm which was odd especially for a resort of this scale.

Our experience was highlighted by the unbelievabley awsome employees at the hotel.  Derek would not rest until he was sure that we were in a room that exceeded all expectations.  We upgraded our planned room and he put us in a suite that fit our needs perfectly.  We needed a quiet room to relax and enjoy and 4055 was perfect.  The concierege and hostesses (prob the wrong term) left no need unmet.  The food was delicious and they went out of their way to make sure we were well fed and pampered.

There are moments looking out through some of the public area windows you would think you were on a cruise ship! I remember coming here as a young adult many years ago when the Ritz Carlton brand was almost opulent, antiques and large open fires. Times have changed. I found this Ritz Carlton to be a little ""tired"" (certainly our pool view room - which was also small and dark for US standards). It's a nice property, don't get me wrong, but I'm finding myself drawn more frequently to boutique style accommodation as these larger high end chains are loosing their edge in the level of unique quality accommodation and personal service.

The hotel is perched on a cliff above a beautiful, classic Southern California beach. I stayed on the club level which felt very cozy and comfortable, if a bit labyrinthine. My room was on the small side but very clean and nice. All the rooms on the West side seem to have balconies that give out on the ocean, which is lovely. The club lounge food was tasty and drinks good. There were some events (weddings, etc) going on in the hotel but being on the club level meant that I could avoid them pretty easily.

The bathroom was extremely outdated and consisted of a tub/shower combo, double sinks, and a separate toilet room. The tub had so many scratches and it looked like it was at least 20 years old.

Staff was friendly and helpful.    Note that they have hidden the electrical outlets in the corridors so that guests can't sit on the chairs and charge their phones/tablets.  Instead, they have a snack shop/coffee shop area with seats and outlets.  It's nice, but i would rather have the option of sitting in a chair in the corridor, but I guess the idea is to generate food/drink sales.  I have just one real complaint, and it may seem trivial, but it shows the cookie-cutter approach they take, rather than actually making each guest feel special.
