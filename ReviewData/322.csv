There are 2 different types of reservations through Expedia. First is to pre-paid reservation and second is to pay at the hotel. Because the reservation is made through Expedia and the credit card information is given does not mean that the room is pre-paid, and most likely you might have checked the box to pay at the hotel option by mistake. When the guest checks into the hotel, there are many confirmations to double check if the rooms are per-paid or not and I'll be happy to go over your reservation status together. Regarding the deposit, at the time of check in, we inform all debit card guests that the deposit will be charged and reverse back at the checkout. And from our experience with most banks, we found that Charge reversal is much faster than Authorization release (pending hold release). But this depends with your bank's policy.

The housekeeping and front desk did all they could to accomodate us - extra towels for the jacuzzi outside, fresh coffee, whatever. Free breakfast was pretty good - not ""junk"" in my opinion since it had waffles and cereal and everything FOR FREE. The area is excellent - plenty of things to do within walking distance if you don't",September 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,336,322

A majority of the rooms (probably 80%) of them back right up to the 405 Freeway (one of the biggest freeways in the LA area). All night I had trucks, cars and motorcycles speeding past my 3rd floor room (shaking the windows) and keeping me awake. The hotel was ""full"" so the front desk clerk (who was not very friendly by the way) said I could not be moved. The Internet service was also VERY slow (desk clerk told me it was because the hotel was full). Although the rooms were clean and the bedding new, this is an older property with a tiny pool and very few amenities. I will never stay here again.",July 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,337,322

Our daughter got a room at the Comfort Inn and said our room was much larger than theirs.  The freeway noise is bad but you cannot sleep without the a/c on and it's drowns out the freeway noise.   It leaves you with sort of a ""white noise"" and we slept okay.    Breakfast is typical Days Inn junk but there is a good cafe across the street.  (Magnolia Cafe).   Good entertainment for the kids next door with roller skating and othe rides and attractions.  Internet is poor.  We were there for a family wedding and did not spend much time in the room.",June 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,338,322

Eversince I lost my lap top while traveling, I do not carry one anymore. One of the top Days Inn I ever been to and I do travel ALOT. I live off the suit case almost 1/2 of the year.  Staffs were very nice.  Close to highway meaning easy access. Little noisy but usually I sleep at night so didn't bother me much. And don't spend time during the day. Rooms were clean enough. Definitely worth the money.",December 2010,none,none,"Dear polyhong,  We're so glad that the computer in the lobby added to your stay.

At the front desk, free coffee, good air con and free wifi.   The bad.... - backs onto a freeway with the window facing 12 lanes of traffic... If you like your rooms to vibrate the this is the place for you!   - air, everyone loves fresh air? Well of you do then stay away, if you want to listen to zooooom hoooonk all day then go for it, not to mention the black fumes that stain the windows!   - the smell..... I have smelt nicer toilets!   Put it this way, as two young adults travelling around California for 3 months..... This was the worst noicyest dingyest hole HELL hole that we have ever stayed in.....   You would be better on the central reservation of a freeway with a gas mask on!",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,340,322
