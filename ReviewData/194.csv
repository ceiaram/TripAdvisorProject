The one and only Fairfield Mission Viejo, made us ban this brand and location from any future stays. The lack of Leadership and hospitality revealed itself, from the moment we stepped into the Front Desk area. The staff choice ( Diego and Junior) seemed like two teenagers behind the desk. No greeting skills, poor check-in process, and no amenities explanation. Never seen such a poor customer service since I’ve been staying in hotels and motels.  Both agents had such a bad attitude from the start. The morning gal ( Jen) had a better demeanor but kinda flat. The staff looked depressed and unhappy to be there.

There are a few possible reasons for the deactivation of a room key. I'm not sure if this was the case for you, but for most of our guests, they keep their hotel key cards in their pocket or purse next to their cell phone. Doing so exposes the magnetic strip of the key card to the magnetic fields of the cell phone, degrading the encoding.That said, I'm sorry the front desk was not more helpful in helping you resolve the issue.

If you read my other reviews, you'll understand that quiet accommodations are the most important hotel room attribute.   Mission Viejo is not a top tourist destination so hotel choices are slim.

Location off Freeway makes is great halfway point between San Diego and Disney.  Value for money was very good especially with free internet and continental breakfast.  Only downside is pool appeared to be not as clean as we would like as it was under trees, although other landscaping for the property was very good.  Clean and dependable.

5 helpful votes,14 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice place,"Stayed here for 6 nights during a holiday in the US.  Hotel room was OK, nice bathroom.  Kept clean during stay.  Location not very good, no good if you have not got your own transport.  Only problem I had with this hotel was the size of the area for the breakfast buffet.  Judging by the number of cars in the hotel car park the hotel was only half full when I stayed, yet on one day I struggled to get a seat for breakfast.  There was was a small pool (not heated) and spa out the back of the hotel.  No restaurant in hotel.  There's a gas station and small mini market immediately outside hotel entrance.  There was a business room that also doubled as  the fitness room (2 treadmills).",April 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,236,194

7 helpful votes,11 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Good Value for Business, Probably not for Vacation","I stayed at the Fairfield Mission Viejo for business in January, 2008.  As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, it is wedged behind two gas stations, so it is a little difficult to find as you are exiting I-5.    Positives:  Grounds are very clean, one of the better kept Fairfields I have seen.  Front desk staff are friendly, and check-in was easy.  The rate was less than 1/2 what I would have paid for a Courtyard 10 miles up the road, which is a definite plus.  Free wireless that is pretty fast.  Free breakfast as well--standard Fairfield fare.  Having the gas stations right next door is nice if you want to pick up a snack or beverage.  If you are driving for business as I am, there is a real advantage to being literally right next to the I-5--it can save you 10-15 minutes",January 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,238,194

I like that you can walk to a big gas station minimart, 1 minute away, open 24 hours, that had great quality deli-style sandwiches, fresh fruit, etc.  Also a Carl's Jr. fast food place 2 minutes walk away, open late.  Not a real destination, but if you're in the area, a good choice.

3 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Loved It,"My wife and I loved the hotel.  Rooms were clean, breakfast was great and the staff was super friendly and helpful.  I slept better here than I do in my own bed.  As I mentioned, all of the staff was great but I would like to give special thanks to Keva & Lorenna at the front desk as they were the ones that had to put up with me during the day.  They always had a smile and helped us a lot with information and directions.  Hey GM, give them a raise.  I highly recommend this hotel and will definately stay here again if I ever get back to the area.  Gary Burden Crystal Lake, IL",July 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,241,194

Being the most expensive hotel of the three we stayed at during our trip, we didn't expect a tiny room, stone-hard beds, pillows with hard clumps in them, shower water that is barely above tepid (at 10:30 at night), and our favorite...a toilet that was picky about flushing-either you had to dump an ice bucket of water into it or wiggle the handle till you got carpal syndrome. Nope, we don't need to ever do this hotel again. The staff was friendly and helpful enough, the continental breakfast was average.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,243,194
