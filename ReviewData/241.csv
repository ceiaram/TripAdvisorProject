The room itself was clean and we found the beds to be comfortable! As others have mentioned, there is something going on with the hot water in the hotel - for example when you are taking a shower, the water would just pretty much shut off mid shower and then come back on intermittently.  The other thing I wanted to mention is that there IS a parking charge to park your car ($25/night) so that was a surprise.

When we called they said everyone was told. Maybe if they would have cleaned the room the day before we might have gotten notice????

Was in the area for Disneyland.  Good location near the Disney Parks.    Felt that hotel and room was dated.  A new coat of paint, and perhaps new carpeting would enhance the experience.    Parking was $17/night.  No way around that.  A Bucca di Beppo shares the same lot, and there is no distinction of what property owns which spaces. Technically you can park at the restaurant and be okay.  Parking is also tight at night because it gets full and the spaces are smaller than regular parking spaces.

Please accept my sincere apology for the long delay in responding.    I want you to know that the items you have brought to my attention have been addressed with our team.  It is very unusual for our breakfast to receive poor comments, as tardiness is never an issue for us and I also addressed your comments on the oatmeal.  Even oatmeal has a brand recipe that has to be followed, so we reviewed it with the team to be sure it is not only quality in taste, but also in presentation and consistency as well.  I also appreciate your comments on the furnishings in your room, and although we do have a rooms preventative maintenance program, sometimes items should just simply be replaced.   We are about to start a complete rooms refresh, which will allow us to have a new product in all of our rooms, which includes all furnishings, wall coverings, draperies, carpet and bathrooms.  Although we do receive many compliments on our current rooms, it is also important that we keep our hotel fresh and contemporary in style for our guests to enjoy.  We are very proud of our staff, so the new product will only compliment their efforts towards providing great service.

Eventually got someone at the front desk who sent a maintenance person who identified the problem. To fix the situation, they kept giving us bath towels to place on the wet carpet.

I want to first apologize for your experience at my hotel as we take pride in the outstanding customer service that we do pride to our guests, and even if we fail to do so, there will never be a reason for us to be rude, as we address any situation that may come up with an attempt to provide our guests with 100% guest satisfaction.    In this particular event I think we got off on the wrong foot to start off your trip, as we do not accept pre-paid green dot credit cards.  I was involved with the decision to accept it, so that you would not be further inconvenienced, so we made the exception, but I can never speak towards what another hotel accepts or not as to their method of payment, which was brought to my attention as well.  I want to personally apologize for us not recognizing your daughter's first time to Disney as we love to acknowledge and also celebrate along with you, and I wish we would have not failed to do so during your visit.  I also have reviewed your breakfast comment with my team, as we normally receive very high marks on our breakfast, so again, it is something to make sure that is strictly monitored, as we always try to do.  If there is anything else I can ever do for you, or your family and friends, please do not hesitate to contact me direct at 714-620-2401, as I hope to meet you and your family in person in the near future.

This unit should have been changed out, as part of our room inspection.     I will also look further into the elevator issue that you mentioned, to see what can be done about this.   That is an area where I like to have the professionals review, so that should adjustments be made they are done with safety in mind, and I also appreciate that you have brought this to my attention.  We are doing a refresh to our elevators as part of our upcoming room renovation, so possibly this can also be addressed at that time.

Our hotel should always be clean (I hear very positive feedback from our guests on this subject) and whether your hotel is older or brand new, it still has to be clean.   We are doing an upgrade to our rooms in the late fall, which is exciting, but it does not take the place of cleanliness to the eyes of our guests.

I always appreciate the feedback as I want your experience to always be perfect, and that includes how you start off your visit!  I see that the concern was that you pre-booked or pre-purchased your room, and possibly the pricing had changed prior to your arrival.   Again, I am trying to put the pieces together on your concern, as I can 100% assure you and all of our wonderful customers which includes families and business accounts, that we would not project any image that is not displaying integrity, as that is how I conduct business, and that is also how Hampton conduct business.     If your rate had been found to be lower (as the market can change), and if the pre-booked package or room does not apply to it, then the rate may not be able to be changed.   What our guests sometimes have to keep in mind that in most of the cases in a very busy leisure or business hotel environment, most of the times rates go way up, and we do not take that pre-booked or advance purchase program rate and then raise the rate as well to the selling rate. Which again is one of the benefits of a pre-purchased room program.   I hope this helps a little bit and I really appreciate that you found the hotel to be nice, as we always want you to have an exceptional experience, and again, I am sorry that it did not start out that way.

This Hampton surely would, based on its great customer service, clean rooms and free WiFi. The fitness center is also a nice plus.  The hotel is located just minutes from Disneyland and the Convention Center on Harbor, and it's close to restaurants and a huge Target. The only negative here is the parking.

We arrived at the hotel at 12:30pm and there were rooms ready for our party.  The front staff was incredibly friendly and things worked out perfectly.  The rooms were fairly clean and fairly standard.  We weren't expecting a lot and it did the job.   The one thing about our room is that it didn't auto lock all the time when we closed it.  I managed to find someone on the floor to look at it.  He said either the battery is dead or keep trying to bang it closed until it locks.

Something that the Hampton Inn prides itself in and is a key point in its advertisements.   So when you have a problem and you politely bring it up with the front desk and they argue with you that you are wrong, do nothing to fix the problem, and at the very least offer no apology- in my book that is TERRIBLE customer service.   The hotel is beyond walking distance to the Disneyland park (which is the only reason families stay at the hotel ). They offer their own shuttle service that is partnered through an outside company.

I must apologies for the situation you were placed in because the hotel was not prepared for your particular situation.  After I learned about what had happen to you and your family I did some investigating and found out that Disney had implemented a new program for its Annual Pass holders.  This program took effect late May/ Early June and it did indeed allow for Annual Pass holder to get a Magic Morning.  This program was something that was new and not told to the Good Neighbor Hotels.  We were unaware of this new program and therefore not prepared to accommodate your needs.  Disney provided the hotels with a schedule for Magic Mornings.  The schedule does not make any reference to this new program.  While this explains how this situation could have occurred, it is up to the service providers to do all they can to service the guests in the best ways possible.

22 helpful votes,8 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Horrible Visit,"I just returned home from a trip to Disneyland with my family to celebrate both of our kid's birthdays over the weekend. I thought it would be appropriate to bring to your attention some concerns and feedback regarding my recent stay at one of your properties. I am a loyal Hilton customer and will NEVER stay at this property again (and we stay TWICE a year in Anaheim for our summer and fall vacations).  Upon arrival on Friday, October 8 (after a 6 hour drive from Phoenix), I approached the front desk clerk to check in. I asked the front desk clerk if there were any upgrades available as a Gold VIP. He checked and told me that he could only upgrade me for one night because the hotel was sold out after that. I told him not to worry about it (although it would have been nice).",October 2010,none,none,"Valued Guest, Again we apologize for your unpleasant experience.  Due to unexpected circumstances your reserved room was unavailable at the time of check-in.  While we normally do not go into details about the inner workings of the hotel, I believe this was one of the occasions that more details are warranted.   First the room type was unavailable at check-in because maintenance was being performed on the room do to damage that had occurred from a previous guest.  When a room is not guest ready we will not sell it.  When a hotel is in a sold out situation any room that has to be taken out of inventory has a negative effect on our guest.  We at the Hampton Inn are conscious of this and do all we can to make sure that our guests are taken care of.  This was one of the reasons we had maintenance personnel working on the room on the evening of your visit.  Fortunately, our maintenance staff was able to get the room back in service and you were able to check into the room.  As for guest preferences, we also do what we can to meet every preference.  We come as close as we can to meet that preference.  Trying to match the room type and the desired location can be difficult at times especially in a sold out situation.  When several guests are checking in with similar request we try to accommodate everyone.  On occasion, some guest preferences cannot be met because the option is not available on the day of arrival.  Noted was your request of an upgrade.  The team member stated that she could upgrade you for one night but the room type was not available for your entire stay.  This is a case of the hotel trying to meet a request and work within the framework of what we had available.  Since GOLD and DIAMOND members aren‚Äôt entitled to a complimentary upgrade at Hampton Inn or Hilton Garden Inn properties, this was an example of the hotel attempting to meet and exceed your expectation.  We here believe that even though the complimentary upgrade is not a benefit that is currently offered by the brand, it is still an expectation of our high level honors members and we try to provide it whenever we can. Secondly, as you are aware we have a beautiful outdoor pool area with a waiting pool, Jacuzzi and full size pool.  This area is gated and secure.  On the day in question a possum slipped through the fence and fell into the pool.  In the eleven years of this hotels existence this is the first time this has happened.  However, this situation is similar to a fly entering the hotel because a door was left open or a stray dog wandering into your yard.  These are all events that can happen even though every effort are taken to ensure that they don‚Äôt.  As soon as the hotel staff noticed that this had happen the situation was quickly taken care of.  We handled this situation like we handle all of our situations, as quickly and as prompt as possible.  Some mornings guest drop food in our lobby while they are taking their morning breakfast from the breakfast area to their rooms.  If you are standing next to the guest when it happens you will see the food spill on the floor.  However, within minutes of the event occurring, the hotel staff springs into action to clean up the mess helping to insure that additional guest are not impacted by the mess.   Finally, I understand that your guest experience was negatively impacted by the issues that occurred during your stay.  While there could be reasons why things happen the way they did we understand that it did not live up to your expectations.   For this reason we evoked the 100% Hampton Guarantee for you.  We here at the Hampton Inn and Suites believe in our 100% promise.  That is why we as a hotel make this statement to all of our guests. You have been kind enough to choose our home while visiting the area and we are grateful.  We have 3 main goals for your stay:  1.	Extend exceptional and excellence service; 2.	Provide you with outstanding accommodations; 3.	Exceed each and every one of your expectations. 4.	 It is our promise and our goal to live up to these principles or we will make it right for guest.

In fact, they share the same big parking lot & use the same shuttle service. I've stayed in all 3 so here's a comparison: - Hampton Inn is slightly more expensive ($120) than the Hilton Garden ($99); but about $10-$20 less than the ES ($140). Hampton it's the most ""kid friendly"" - lots of drawings by young ""Artists in residence"" in the lobby. It's cleaner than the ES but not as clean as the HG.
