I stayed here a few years ago and it was not this bad. When I tried to contact corporate both numbers listed online did not work. There were roaches and some kind of jumping bug I’ve never seen before. The older female that checked me in was rude. I asked to check in early and she said nothing was available. When I said that I’d like to cancel there was a room available. There was a bug on the sheet on the bed and when I asked housekeeping to change it she just gave me a look and seemed like she didn’t speak English. I went to take the sheets off and underneath there was a bunch of food and trash.
