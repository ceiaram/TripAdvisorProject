The only negative thing I can report is that the hall echos outside the door. It can be very loud if you have other guests unaware of how the sound carries. The hotel can remedy this by adding stripping to and around the door frames of each room. The restaurants within walking distance are absolutely fantastic.

40 helpful votes,22 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A comfortable stay with a clean kitchen,"Speaking as a member of a food allergy family, it’s nice to be able to stay at A location that has its own small little kitchen that you can cook with. The hotel does provide utensils, pots, and pans for the electric stove / oven that’s in your room, but you’re more than welcome to bring your own items with you if you’re concerned about cross contamination or allergen-residue.   The staff has always been hospitable and would help you however they are able to at a moments notice.

I've always know this property was a little quirky, but we learned to enjoy that about the hotel.  However this past visit in December of 2019, made  us decide to not return.  The bathroom had visible mold all over the shower walls.  Plus, MANY long hairs were stuck on the shower walls.  If they are not cleaning the obvious areas, it makes me wonder if they are not cleaning the rest (like changing the sheets).   I've noticed the cleaning has gone downhill the past couple of visits.

And I will choose to stay at HPT when I return - eventually with family. The traffic and busyness of LA is a beat-down, so it's nice to come back to a hotel that is clean, very spacious, well-decorated, and even more importantly low-key & relaxing. It was beautifully decorated for Christmas, and the staff was extremely friendly. Only constructive feedback I have is to have disposable razors available (can't take them on carry-on) and more importantly to offer the breakfast (pastries, cereal, and fruit) before the 7 am-10 am window. To get anywhere in LA by 8 am, you have to leave before 7 am - which was my case 2 out of the 3 days I was there.

I love the Spanish style decor of the place. It came with everything we needed! A full kitchen, big closet that we didn’t even use, a couch and table and huge bed. The bed and pillows weren’t as comfy as most hotel beds are but it wasn’t horrible. The ac didn’t feel like it was staying on because I kept waking up hot and sweating so I barely slept with the sheets and blankets but maybe it was just me because the boyfriend was perfect he said. Besides that, I loved everything else. The heated pool was nice, could be a little more heated during this time! Loved that it’s close to shops and restaurants as well. Service was also great.

I made the reservations online on the hotel site and check-in was a breeze. Slight hiccup that is that you should have a credit card vs. debit card for incidentals. Debit cards result in a higher deposit. The kitchenette was very useful with a gas stove and oven. The skillet was pretty well hammered and the Teflon was flaking off. I would suggest bringing one of your own if you are particular (I brought a crock pot). There was a terrible heat wave in the area that week, but the AC unit worked like a dream and was very quiet. The continental breakfast at the restaurant on-site was very lite (cereals, cut fruit, yogurt, toast, small pastries and coffee/juice. I cooked eggs and such in the room.

I've also stayed here two times before as well. It is a few minutes drive to both Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. The staff is quite friendly and accommodating.

The continental breakfast was OK, but was overloaded with carbohydrates such as bagels, cereal, toast and donuts ... it would have been nice to have some kind of protein to choose from, although they do offer hot breakfast items for a very reasonable price.

For the price is great but I have to mention few things that were uncomfortable: thin walls, I had a pretty bad neighbor who was shouting at midnight or maybe he was just loud but you could hear everything; the bathroom door could use a fresh paint; the bathroom sink needs urgent remodeling, its old, ugly, stained, and the cabinet is falling apart, please remodel the sinks; the shower handles were loose, and the cleaning staff left a considerable amount of hair in the tub, good thing it was my own but still this doesn't happen in a Hilton, so that's why I say it's great for the price but if the staff wants to grow and keep getting nice reviews you should do better.

Unfortunately the unusable WiFi is a deal breaker for us. This is especially true because something about the building interferes with cell phone service. On top of that the Jack and Jill door between rooms is paper thin. We were forced to jam blankets and pillows in between the doors to drown out the sound of the drunks next door.

I did not have a good stay due to a noise in the exhaust fan in the kitchen. it was due to high winds but regardless it kept me up all night. I called front desk at 130 am my options were to pack up everything and move at 130am or tough it out. I regret not changing rooms   because it kept waking me up every 5 or 10 minutes .

Also - the restaurant next door delivers to your room, and the food's great - there is a Vallarta supermarket across the street for your day to day stuff (and some of the best carnitas I've ever had).

The hotel is very nice and the rooms are very spacious.  If you want a quiet room book one on the rear of the hotel.  If you want to over look the pool and soak in the busier front sights (The noise was not an issue for us, but you can hear people in the pool until 9pm) book on the front.     Due to the slightly old Kitchen and Bathroom fixtures and lack of a hot tub to compliment the pool, I cannot give the Pepper Tree a Five Star rating.

Although advertised as a 'Disneyland Neighborhood Hotel', be prepared for a 30-min freeway trip to actually get to the park. On the way there you can get a look at the actual Disney Neighborhood hotels, which are right around the park, not 30 mins away. As an added bonus, you have to pay for parking, or get a taxi; the Disney shuttles don't go out to Pepper Tree. It is also advised to brush up on your Korean if you plan on leaving Pepper Tree by foot, or it may give you some trouble figuring out what the buildings in the somewhat dodgy area around the hotel are advertising.

I am sorry that the hotel was not a good fit for your expectations however  I would like to point out a few inconsistencies. Our housekeeping record does show that daily housekeeping was attempted. Housekeepers are not permitted to enter a room when ""do not dosturb signs"" are displayed by guests . Also your room was reported on check out by housekeeping that  it smelled of smoke. Smoking may have been ok in college dorms but is strictly prohibitted in the hotel . I hope that in the future you do respect this policy at other hotels. We do not market the hotel as a ""Disneyland Neighborhood Hotel"" and we do suggest on our website that guests have a vehicle.  Disneyland is 3.9 miles or a 9 minute drive from the hotel, not 30 minutes. We do not charge for parking. Yoour comments reflecting the area as Koren are misleading as  Anheiman is 75% hispanic.

This place is great since they are literally only a hop skip and a jump from the major theme parks. We got married at the Old Santa Ana Court House which is gorgeous by the way. It's easier to marry here than it is in Los Angeles (you can even fill out your marriage license on line and they will married within minutes!). We literally honeymooned here at the hotel and it was wonderful. The staff were great and super friendly, Joey at the front desk was nice enough to help knot my fiance's tie and Rick congratulated us with a bottle of wine.

I've been here since early January, and it's now May and I can't desribe how ""at home"" I feel.  Whether I'm enjoying my morning coffee or a cocktail after work, the balcony overlooking the pool is a tranquil place to be.  My room is spacious, and I don't know how I could do without the modern kitchen.  All the essentials are provided from the coffee maker to kitchen sponges.  Rick, the manager, Mark and John the owners, and all the staff help me feel at home.  When you ask any of them for local advice, its not like asking a concierge, but more like asking a family member.

My mom and I stayed at this hotel last month and were thoroughly impressed with the level of service. The rooms have delightful Spanish-style appointments and the overall decor was quite attractive. The staff members-especially the host named Rick-were very helpful with finding suitable activities for me (and my elderly mother) along with recommending some excellent area restaurants that were their personal favorites.

7 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Pepper Tree -A Great Place to Stay,I stayed at the Hotel Pepper Tree while working as a Field Interviewer in the Anaheim and surrounding areas. I can honestly say it is one of the best hotels I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. The Pepper Tree is decorated in beautiful Mexican tile with lovely woodwork throughout the interior. It is accented with quaint Mexican pottery as well as authentic paintings. The rustic light fixtures & wooden antique furniture topped off the Spanish influenced decor which made me feel like I was actually in Mexico. The staff was very courteous and friendly. They helped me find my way in totally unknown neighborhoods through Internet searches. The rooms are very nice with beautiful decor and lovely tile floors.

(ok so I’m a procrastinator, but at least I'm finally writing the review).  There were some problems due to being newly reopened, but they were dealt with quickly and professionally.  Pros – Inexpensive spacious suite, 2 bathrooms, 2 large closets, comfortable beds, 4 pillows on bed - 2 regular/2 feather, fully-stocked kitchen (medium sized fridge, oven/stove, microwave, coffee maker, pots, pans, silverware and flat ware) was great with grocery across street – saved money not having to eat out every meal, free wireless internet, very friendly helpful staff – printing maps as needed, etc.,  short drive to Disneyland.

Nice place and a very short drive to Disney.  We booked our room the old-fashioned way by calling the hotel directly, and I think we got a better deal than what was advertised on Expedia at the time.  The other reviews are accurate, it can get a bit noisy especially if you are on the side of Lincoln Ave, although we had no problems getting a good night's sleep.  The room itself was very spacious, clean, and the appliances were all new.  Having a Ralph's grocery store across the street was great, we saved a lot on money on food and drinks on this trip!

It is located just a short drive to Disneyland parks.  It is not really by any other hotels.  This 1970s hotel looks to have been remodeled in a Mexican style.  They really did a nice job.    They restaurant in the parking lot is closed, don't know why.  They pool is pretty decent.  The parking lot is unsecure, but has lighting.  We had no problem at all with the parking.  They representatives were very helpful and knowledgeable for the area.  I guess you would call this a boutique hotel in a small way.    The only issues were the bathroom floors were dirty and unswept.  We had to let our children step on them from a bath.  The large slider doors to the balconeys are original.
