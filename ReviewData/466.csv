8 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unbeliveably friendly & helpful owners, breakfasts were delicious","What a gem! Stumbled across this unusual, but special, place by chance. The whole place is very clean, and very comfortable and the breakfasts delicious and include a daily fresh fruit-plate which is a work of food art. But what stood out for us, and why we recommend this to anyone was a) the value for  money and b) the really friendly owners. They were unbelievably helpful and curteous, and humerous too. This place is run by two interesting people who *really like people* and it shows in everything thing they do - from the moment  we arrived tired after our flight to when we reluctantly said goodbye to this little hidden gen in 'The O.C.'.  Kandi and Nigel are some of the nicest people we've ever met.",August 2009,none,Traveled as a couple,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,466
