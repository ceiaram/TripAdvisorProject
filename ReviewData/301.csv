I stayed here while in the area on business. My flight in was late and I was dead tired. The girl at the desk checked me in very quickly and was very pleasant in her manner.  The room was great. Very large and comfortable. I stayed three nights and the room was cleaned very well every day. The cooked-to-order breakfast (FREE) was a very pleasant surprise and tasted very good.

The security of a window on that level is marginal.  Also, the window in the faux balcony in our room (311) had a screen that was broken and pushed out, which made me wonder if someone had tried to access that room through that window.  I simply forgot to report that when I was there.  My apologies to management.  They could not correct something they may not have known about.  -  Another thing which would keep me from giving this hotel a ""5"" all around is that the entire place badly needs freshening and painting.

It was convenient as the Avis office is located right in the lobby of the hotel.  Upon my arrival at the John Wayne Airport, I called the hotel and requested that the (complimentary) shuttle be dispatched to pick me up at the airport.

I live in Southern California but need a couple of nights about 60 miles away near Irvine California. I used TA (as usual) and found a gem of a hotel at a ""stupid"" price of $72 in Orange County California. Comparable hotels that might be more fancy were priced at $200 or more but the TA reviews convinced me that the Quality Inn John Wayne Airport would be ideal and it was. It is an older property harkening back to the designs of the 1980s in a Spanish motif but it was well kept.

At Quality Suites we strive to provide the best hospitality experience for all of our valuable guests. Unfortunately, we were not able to achieve this goal for your recent stay with us.  When you asked to use the free safe deposit box, you signed an agreement and were issued the only key to access your box. (The hotel was provided by the safe deposit box manufacturer with ONLY one key for each box and the only key (a special flat key) can NOT be duplicated. So if a key was  lost, the hotel will  have to drill into the deposit box. For this reason, our hotel asks for a refundable $25 key deposit). To open a safe deposit box, it requires two keys - one is so called the 'master guard key' that is kept by the hotel and the other key which is unique to each box is kept by the guest who uses the box. Since the hotel does not have the safe deposit key that is kept by the guest, no one can open a safe deposit box with only the master guard key.   After you reported that your money was stolen, the hotel manager advised you to report this incident  to the local police. After reviewed  the video camera tape, the police found no evidence of theft from the hotel employee. The video tape and hotel records revealed  that another person who stayed with you had accessed the box without your presence prior to your report of money stealing. According to the police, you told the police that you had taken $300 from the box  in three $100 bills. The video showed you had taken seven bills. After the police left, you approached the hotel manager asked for comp room or a discount. The hotel was not able to give you a discount nor a comp room because the hotel  was not at fault. The next day, you asked for early check out. Since you accepted the hotel early check out policy at check in by endorsing the registration card that discloses the hotel early check out policy, the hotel was not able to accommodate your request.  You also wanted to cancel your  other reservation which carries a no cancellation condition due to its discount rate. However, the hotel went ahead to cancel your other reservation.  The $25 deposit was refunded after you returned the key.   I am very sorry this very unpleasant experience had happened during your stay with us.

In order to remain competitive as well as reward our frequent guests, we often offer promotional rates.  At the time of your reservation, you were informed that the rate you were given was a special rate and that your credit card would be pre-charged.  It is our policy to not promise specific rooms but rooms in the general area you are requesting.  The executive suite you were initially checked into was located in the back of our property overlooking our wonderful courtyard with a fountain.  When you expressed displeasure with this particular location we were able to move you to a room one floor below the specific room you requested.  However, you were still unhappy and decided to leave.  We were very happy that the next day you decided to return to our hotel for a 2 night stay.  All the executive suites on our property come with views overlooking either our pool area or courtyard area and come equipped with a balcony.

One of the families had ants in their room. Bad News:  The staff was not very friendly or helpful.  Our extended family had three rooms.  Each room comes with free breakfast, but one of our rooms came with an insufficient number of breakfast tickets.  It is possible, but not probable that we lost a days worth of breakfast tickets.  When we inquired at the front desk, we were treated like we were trying to cheat them out of two free breakfasts.  I am sure that some people do possibly cheat, but we did not and when we made an honest inquiry, we were treated with suspicion.
