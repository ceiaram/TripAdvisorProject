The shower pressure is TERRIBLE - this was noted at checkout so I hope this has been resolved for the next guest in our room.   Our room over looked the games balcony which meant we could never have the blinds open.   Now for my main issue. Our credit card was charged not once but twice for the full amount of our stay (nearly $1800) despite being paid in full before our stay. This was done on check in and then again on check out. This is totally unacceptable and I will be taking this complaint further.

81 helpful votes,137 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice but still missing a little,"First, keep in mind that SpringHill suites are constructed cheaper than Marriott hotels. Therefore you will hear a lot more outside noise (traffic, babies crying in the next room, people walking in the room above, etc.). Also, SpringHill suites are all designed so that the bathroom door is translucent, meaning that if anyone uses the bathroom, the light floods the bedroom. Poor design--it should be opaque or solid. Very annoying. That being said, this was a nice hotel. The lobby is exceptional, and the morning breakfast was always kept refreshed. Lots of room to sit and relax.The one problem with the stay was that housekeeping did not clean the room.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very nice stay, will definitely go back",I stayed here for 5 nights the week of Thanksgiving.  The hotel is very new clean and accommodating.  They have free breakfast every day which was a big perk and have smart TVs in the room so the one night my husband and I stayed in we were able to watch Netflix.  It is important to keep in mind that it is not close to the beach though so if you are planning to stay there definitely rent a car.  The cost is only $10 a day which to the other hotels were like $50 a day.  I definitely will stay here when I return.

Lucky for us, it's a great new property.  Room: spacious for newer hotels, has a large desk to work at, bed was comfortable, very clean, bathroom was nice. Couple of things I didn't like though was the lack of a rack for your suitcase inside the closet, and also did not have a safe inside the room.  Hotel Property: Lobby was bright and clean.

The hotel is in a good location - just off the 405 and across the street from a variety of restaurants and shops. The continental breaksfast was decent enough and the staff was very helpful.

Directly across the street from dining and restaurants. This hotel is new, modern, spacious, clean and has very nice amenities. The hot complimentary breakfast was way better than other hotels I have experienced....it varied each day but included scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, potatoes/home fries, oatmeal, cereal, fresh fruit, pastries, cheeses, coffee, tea, etc. The gym was sufficient. Equipment was clean, new and there was complimentary water and headphones to use.

This hotel is NEW...as in the towels-still-leave-little-fuzzies-all-over-you kind of new. Such a comfortable place to call our temporary home while we got our daughter settled into her first year at Biola University.  Pretty centrally located to just about whatever you want to do while in the area. Beautifully decorated, super friendly and helpful staff. The only hiccups would be the fact that there is very little variation of the complimentary breakfast, although it is good and lots to choose from.
