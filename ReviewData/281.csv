A big plus for us are hotels that are pet friendly since we enjoy bringing our dog on road trips.  Our room was updated and spacious with a small fridge and microwave.  The bed is quite comfortable but I had trouble falling asleep since I could hear planes flying right over the hotel about every 15 mins.  It finally quieted down sometime after 11pm.  We also went down to the indoor pool area - the pool is just average and could use an upgrade.  The water was warmer in some sections of the pool than other sections.  There was no hot tub either.

The hotel also has a small outside area with patio furniture and a fire pit for warmth at nights.  We didn't use the fitness room or the swimming pool but were told that they were available.

There was not a sign to guide the guests to where they are supposed to detour. Only signs that said ""If you park here you WILL BE TOWED"". Talk about anti-hospitality. We did not feel welcomed even before we set foot in the hotel. 2.

8 helpful votes,8 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Everything was great until breakfast,"I stayed here on a Friday night before flying out of Orange County the next morning. The hotel appears to be brand new and is designed and decorated in the new SpringHill style, which I like very much: separate rooms for toilet/sink and vanity/shower, half of a divider wall between the living/work area and the beds. My room was in a corner, so the layout may have been a little irregular; it had a separate wardrobe instead of a built-in closet.  My only complaint about the room itself is that the ventilation system was loud. This may not be an issue with rooms not on the top floor, and at any rate, it wasn't loud enough to keep me awake.
