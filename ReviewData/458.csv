2 helpful votes,28 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Disneyland trip,"OMG hostel was perfect for my stay to visit Disneyland for two nights. Owner, Phong, is so personable and helpful ! He gave me a ride to Disneyland in his Tesla and is taking me back by 7:00 am tomorrow! The hostel is in a nice neighborhood, clean and well kept. Itâ€™s cool you leave your shoes at the front door and there is a bedroom door code for safety. I had a sweet bottom bunk with plug for devices and free WiFi. And for the low cost makes it a perfect stay ! I will be back!",March 2020,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,458
