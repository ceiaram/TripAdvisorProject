Make sure you bring your own hand soap because they are not always quick to refill the soap. It is a family friendly campground and it is impossible to expect peace and quiet; so many kids running around and scream from the tops of their lungs. We had site 85 (a premium campsite) and we thought we hit the jackpot. Wrong! Site 85 is located right next to the lifeguard tower that is ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù to the public to hang out, meaning random people will come and go, including screaming kids and their scooters, bike, and what have you.

We have been coming here for years and have never had this happen. It was nightmare to get back in. There are a lot of homeless people who use the day-use lot and bathrooms but if they want to keep them out then put a gate outside of that lot not the whole park! Good luck to you if you have an emergency like we did.   The rangers also lock the bathrooms right by the beach SO early every day. It‚Äôs ridiculous.

They charge $15 irrespective - even though you have already paid the site fee.  The staff also seem to have a serious attitude problem.
