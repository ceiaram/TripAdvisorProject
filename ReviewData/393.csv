But over couple of years they have improved to good extent. Great room service and also we needed some sort of help and the manager was quick to act. Quiet and clean neighborhood.

It was so horrible. It felt like one of those motels you see in the movies where people meet up with hookers and drug dealers. And we took our kids here! Absolutely terrible",March 2014,none,none,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,393
