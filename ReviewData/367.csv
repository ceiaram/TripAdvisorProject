1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Experience,"We stayed at this hotel for our trip to Seaworld and Knotts.  Not just the hotel,but the whole city was very nice and quiet. The hotel was very clean and check in couldnt be any easier. Our room was very clean, it had a fridge and a microwave. My husband, daughter and I slept the whole night with no dissruptions. In the morning at check out i was greeted by a man who i believe might be the owner.  He was very curtious and right away wanted to know how everything was, he offered breakfast, but unfortunately we had over slept and did not have time. He also offered to provide me with maps for our trip. His service was just awesome and made our experience great. For the price and the experience, i would definitely stay there again!",August 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,42,367
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We liked it and we'll be back!!!,Pros:  Good and safe neighborhood - The place is in a residential area and hence it was safe to come late in the night. Friendly owners and great service.  Cons: No water in the room and internet at times fails to work.,July 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,43,367
35 helpful votes,183 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clean, Basic, and Extremely Friendly","My husband and I stayed at the Rodeway Inn in Cypress to attend a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament at Cal State Long Beach.  I chose this hotel because we needed the basics; cleanliness, a central location, and an affordable price.  The drive to the Walter Pyramid took only 10-15 minutes, a quick drive to the 605 south hooked into the 405.  The room was clean.  The grounds were well maintained.  The front desk was manned by a couple that I believe owns the hotel.    Upon check-in, we were greeted by a lovely woman with a warm hello.  They were extremely accommodating, our plans changed at the last minute and we needed to stay one extra night.  The day we checked out the same friendly woman thanked us profusely for our business.      We attend similar events a few times a year in",June 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,44,367
108 helpful votes,23 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great property for the price,We stayed here a couple of weeks ago with a sports team. The motel was well-maintained and quiet. The on-site managers were very helpful and even opened the continental breakfast bar early for us 2 days in row. Check-in was very easy as they already had all the room assignments & keys made up when we walked in.  (Be aware that the beds are very very firm.) The team  travels to the area a couple times a year and we will be returning.  This property is much better than the Quality Inn down the street where we have also stayed.,April 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,45,367
