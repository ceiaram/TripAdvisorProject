The management company couldn't have been any nicer and more thorough with local guides/information, and property details.

The neighbor you mention has been evicted and is now gone (it wasn't our property). We are located in a very safe, quiet, family area and this was an isolated incident. Due to any lingering concerns we have installed a ""Yardlock"", a device that is combination only, on the 6 foot gate on the side to the rear of the property.  It is hooded on the opposite side and can only be operated from the rear or combination from the front.  This property is completely walled and fenced in. There is NO alley in back (would be easier access for anyone with intent of entering) making this Casa one of the safest ground level properties in Newport Beach.  One would have to go through two gates with the second gate being the 6FT locked gate, a well lit courtyard, and scale the 6ft gate or wall to enter.  Not that one would need it (and obviously was not seen by you), but there is a portable air conditioner as well as plenty of fans in each unit.  There also was a bar for the sliding glass door that one can use.  As far as parking which is an issue at any beach, you forgot to mention that you get a one car garage with each rental. Also due to the new Marina Park at the end of the beach, parking is particularly plentiful here...much of it metered though (some free spots can be had).  What you were observing was this same neighbor ""jockeying"" his roommates and his car for the ""free"" spots and both are long gone. I will send you pictures of the ""Yardlock"".
