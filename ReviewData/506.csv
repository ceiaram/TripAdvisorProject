none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Great people,"Great customer service and good people, but there was a strange smell inside the room for which we had to buy a candle for. The smells seemed like it was coming from the air conditioner. The floor was really dirty and the mattresses weren’t really comfortable. The shower head was pointing towards the wall and you couldn’t wash your body that well.",August 2019,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,506

As we arrived to the parking lot after a day of sightseeing and eating another person staying at the motel stopped us and tried to sell us meth... She wouldn't stop taking to us, at that point I didn't even want to stay when she asked us what room were staying in. We went into our room and right away we saw the stained bed and curtains. The beds are awful and filled with bed bugs. Unfortunately we were on a low budget and had to deal with this for a week, not once was there room service. What bothered me the most was the bed bugs. Every night we would wake up because we kept getting bitten.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,BED BUG INFESTATION!,"I have routinely had to use this motel because of it's proximity. On my first stay the room wasn't equipped with the basic essentials such as microwave and refrigerator. The air conditioning hardly ever works in any of the rooms and if it does it's so loud you'll have to turn the volume up on everything just to listen. The BED BUGS were awful! The ""Staff"" is greedy and obnoxious. The services are awful, there is no daily room service for vacuuming and linen exchange. It's the worse place I've ever stayed in life!",July 2014,none,Traveled solo,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,4,506

The sign outside said the price was $35, but then I was told it was $60, because the $35 is for another day of the week. So, right away I was put off, but $60 wasn't a bad price, so I let it go.  I didn't actually go into the room until a few hours later, as I did more site seeing and then grabbed a bite to eat. Upon entering, I could not believe what I saw! The room was was in horrible condition. There was graffiti on the door on the inside, the bedsheets were terribly stained and had hair on them. The bath towels were so dirty they were no longer white, but a shade of dirty gray.  The furniture was broken. Not just a piece here and there, but literally every piece, from the",February 2014,none,Traveled solo,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,506
