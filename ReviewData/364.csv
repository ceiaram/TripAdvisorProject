Not the best as far as nearby businesses, but I f you have a car, you'll be okay. Clean. If you use the Sahara as a base of operations, you'll be okay. If you relax in the room, you will be comfortable with one exception: like the last time we stayed, the lighting is sparse and stark.  Maybe lower wattage bulbs would be the answer. Good TV and Wifi.

Bring at least one. Okay, now the good - Our room was spacious. The bed was excellent. The A/C worked well and was quiet. The Sahara has two buildings, one facing North amd one facing South.

6 helpful votes,8 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Decent budget style hotel,"Stayed here with my fiancé for about 5 days while we stayed in Anaheim. Yes it is dated, I can't lie it epitomises the word ""budget"" but by the same token having stayed in the Anaheim/Buena park area a few times now I'd say most of the hotels have the exact same type of rooms. If your a family stay at the knotts hotel or somewhere near Disney, for everyone else (unless your very picky) it's a good choice if your on a budget. Easily the best price for a hotel in the area.   Pros: central to plenty of stuff: Buena Park downtown is a 5 minute drive away, Walmart neighbourhood mart and CVS within walking distance, coin op laundry around the corner. There's a cool little mall in cypress 10minutes down the road too. Disney and knotts are super close and Huntington Beach 30mins away.",February 2017,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,10,364

I booked through Expedia.   We had to drive from Las Vegas to Anaheim, after a late night event at a band's clothing store. I would be much later than the expected late afternoon check in time. I called ahead and the owner assured me the rooms wouldn't be given away and I was fine.  I pulled up to the hotel at 4:30am. I was exhausted. The owner came out to greet me. He was happy to see I made it in safely (he expressed concern for me driving that late at night). He gave me the room keys and offered the remotes for the TV (which we declined as we would be sleeping, getting up and ready to go to a concert, then coming back to sleep and repeat).

We stayed for 4 nights and were well prepared to make sure the room felt comfortable. But, if we didn't come prepared with Lysol wipes, mothballs, extra blankets and towels, and the like - the stay would have been a little stressful. The motel is owned by a nice couple but the problem with family owned motels is that it shows wear and tear in the upkeep. The entire time we were there, painting and maintenance was going on with the pool and railings. It wasn't too noisy, but we didn't get access to the pool.

It had a neon sign stating 'open 24 hrs'. There was no one at reception. When we rang the bell, the owner couple seemed angry we woke them up and were extremely rude. We put the credit card in for payment and it was declining...because the rude little man at the desk was pressing CANCEL on purpose-thinking he was secretly turned to one side, but we saw him do it! After 4 attempts, he demanded cash only. We said we'd get it from the car and we sped off. Creepy looking place and so much extra furniture sitting around the outside of the building.

3 helpful votes,4 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Good for the price,"Stayed here on business for 2 nights. Was it the cleanest, most sparkling 5-star deluxe hotel I've ever stayed in? No. Did it have everything I needed for the price I paid? Absolutely. The beds were clean and bug free. My belongings and I stayed safe. It was close to food and disneyland, plus it was quiet. I wouldn't recommend it for families with babies who may crawl around on the floor or get into dated cupboards with questionable contents, or anyone high-maintenance, as the pool was down, and there is no breakfast.
