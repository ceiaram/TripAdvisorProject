A gentleman answered (it must have been a cell phone because you could tell he was in the car), he did not apologize for the inconvenience, all he said was “hold on. I’ll be there in a minute” which I felt was rude and unprofessional. But that wasn’t what upset me. We ended up waiting another 20 minutes, so THIRTY MINUTES total from the time we got to the hotel, to the time he arrived. Mind you, this was not an odd time—it was around 3:00 in the afternoon. When the gentleman finally arrived, he did not apologize, nor try to explain where he was or why he kept us waiting. Unacceptable.   It gets worse.

This place is simple, practical, and minutes from laid-back beach frolic. A few things to know: 1) Despite the name of the hotel, it's not a short walk to the main beach, so most will drive. 2) Any big SUV will barely fit in the small parking spots. 3) The continental breakfast takes a minimilist approach -- looks like they go to 7-11 every morning",September 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,83,321

If you want a cheap place to sleep in San Clemente, it's fine.  The good:  -Close to the beach -San Clemente is a nice town -Rooms are clean enough  The bad: -Close to the freeway (noise) -A little dingy -Deadbolt was weak- not the most secure room but in San Clemente I wouldn't be that worried -The bed was really soft -Towel had cigarette burns",March 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,84,321

The place is nice and clean and smells nice,too. The also have a 75 cents vending machine downstairs for thirsty times. When was the last time you've seen anything in vending machines that cost 75 cents?! Hello......like, 10 years ago! But this place isn't trying to rip you off. IT is cozy and I would definitely stay here again.",December 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,85,321

Cute little Inn with 3 levels ... all levels have patio tables and chairs with an umbrella.  It's great to have free WI FI for our laptop computers and the little fridge is just right along with the microwave which is very handy for us.  We stayed 4 nights last week and really enjoyed it so booked another 4 nights for this week.  I only wish they started the breakfast earlier than 8:30am since we need to leave early each morning and don't get a chance to enjoy it.,October 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,86,321
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,weekend at the beach,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Little Inn by the Beach.  It was cute with its beachy theme and they just got new carpet.  The staff was friendly.  The continental breakfast  was just coffee, juice, fruit, packaged muffins and danish but it was a great start to our mornings before we went to the beach.  It was the cleanest hotel we have been to in this area.  I would stay there again.",April 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,87,321
3 helpful votes,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Little Inn offers Little,The Little Inn by the Beach has a great location and that's where it ends.  The parking lot has spaces for the size of a Yugo.  The door to your room will surely stick and really good.  The hot water to your sink will appear after you run the water for 10 minutes.  This is a environmental (green) facility??  It will take 2 days to get a light bulb changed.  The carpet is sure to be stained.  The front door is sure to be dirty as well as the interior trim around the windows and door.  You may or may not receive maid service.  The best aspect of the Inn is the location which is very good.  It is a great place if you do not spend any time in your room.,August 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,88,321
