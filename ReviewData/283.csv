6 helpful votes,9 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,So disappointed we went to another hotel.,"My husband and I wanted a romantic night away from the kids. Love the location… so disappointed in the room. We booked the top floor, Casa del Rey, and as we walked up the 5 flights of stairs noticed chipping paint and rotting wood everywhere. Our private balcony had more chipped paint on everything and the furniture was terribly uncomfortable and sparse. Once the door was opened… very stale and stuffy… NO CARPET! Just a cement floor with chipped paint and a large shower with mildew. The step up to the bathroom was masked with torn blue tape, so we didn’t trip. I really think this little hotel has possibilities and it doesn’t seem like it would take too much to freshen it up… but seems like owners have given up.

The owners had it for 30 years and cared about their hotel.  Each room used to have its own vibe with  a color scheme, shells, decor. They used to have free snacks in a basket and a bag of toys to take to the beach. They used to have a breakfast area with a buffet, help yourself French press, hot chocolate, fruit, ice and popcorn.  And they used to have a very nice manager, Margie, who made you feel welcomed.   All that is all gone now with the new owner, Mark Garegos. All the walls are white and the rooms have no personality.

I am very sorry to have to point out; you would seriously have to be just nuts! That is the single greatest exaggeration I have ever heard In 24 years of owning and operating my hotel! The heart shaped candy is placed in a cellophane wrapper on a scalloped sea shell at the toe of the pillows on the bed upon arrival. Melted? Impossible.  The decks are the only smoking areas. However if guests are uncomfortable with this, we do have a policy to close the decks for smoking. Again, they were only here for a few minutes and no one was on in the building at that time. Marjorie even offered to upgrade them to the 3 ed floor to accommodate them for their smoking concern. They would be the only occupant’s of that floor that night. But they refused.  This guest did try to dispute their credit card charge due to his immediate departure and violation of our cancelation policy. I will quote the response from the manager, “He was obviously angry and, as he is a large man, frankly frightening, so I did not attempt to engage him. He had an exchange with the manager of the Casa Tropicana’s adjoining restaurant who, not knowing what was up, asked him if everything was okay. The guest responded by saying ‘this *%#!@* place thinks they can take my $300 they’ve got another thing coming’.  In his credit card  charge back response he also complained about our beds not being king size as advertised, and it felt like a water bed when one person moved, it woke up the other! In fact it is a California king and he did not even spend the night nor ever lie on the bed!! They left only minutes after arrival!  Finally if you still wonder, please note, the date of the stay is stated by him as being October of 2013. The date of this review is January 2014, four months later. That’s because our cancelation policy is very clear. He lost his credit card dispute and vindictively has attempted to wreck us for personal satisfaction.  I am very sorry we could not make this person happy. He simply didn’t want to be here for personal reasons that were entirely beyond our influence or control. But when you run a small hotel, last minute arbitrary cancelations due to one’s personal reasons should not affect our business. I kept my promise; his room was ready, warm, and waiting for them upon their arrival as agreed. It is not our fault if he elected not to keep his commitment and take advantage of his room as he agreed to in writing and by signature. Rick Anderson Owner",none,none,none,none,none,none,78,283

After notifying the staff there was little urgency taken in their actions and rather apathetic, uncaring attitudes.

When your hot water heater goes down it is a very big problem...huge. I can guarantee you no one took it lightly or apathetically. I live here too and we had the same experience. I can promise you this is a very serious matter. The failure occurred late in the evening and was back up by 10:00/10:30 the next morning. I can show from the emergency call bills I was very serious about this. However, our tank less instant hot water system did not completely fail. It did produce warm water, not hot enough to use the in room spa with, but warm enough to shower with, as my wife and I did. Not acceptable, but satisfactory until the repairs were made and reasonable under these trying conditions.   I am very sorry but sometimes things are well beyond my control. I acted diligently and successfully to resolve the problem in a very fashionable time. We were full at the time and all of the other guests were understanding, so I thank them for that. It makes it easier with things go wrong.  I cannot address the TV problem because we were unaware, and still have no knowledge of it. Apparently they we’re able to fix it, or it fixed itself. We have no record of a call for service on it and its working fine now. We are beach front, we do get sand, and we do sweep the decks daily, I’m sorry you caught us with sand on the deck.

We appreciate the positive things you confirmed in your comments. Unfortunately it seems we were just not the right fit for your expectations. Here at the beach in the season, it does get really busy. Guests do enjoy the decks more, it gets dark around 8:30 and they love the great sunsets from the comforts of the common deck.   As you pointed out there are 5 rooms on the second floor and only two on the third. The fifth floor is a completely private penthouse deck with total seclusion. This may have been a better choice in your case. Our photos are exactly as they are in real life.

We were not obligated to refund any of your total amount as you acknowledged, but we did! You just paid for you stay. A very important neglected sign of our hospitality.  Living and working here at the Pacific Ocean has its unique sets of environmental issues from rusting wrought iron rails to kelp flies. Here at the beach, especially as close as we are, about 150 yards to the water, we often seem to be right on the beach.  Occasionally the tide brings up kelp from the ocean to the beach. As the kelp dries on the sand, little kelp flies begin to feed on the kelp. Sometimes they don’t know they shouldn’t be entering the buildings in close range and just hang around, as they sometimes do. This is what you experienced. The area you described as our out door kitchen is in fact a coffee station. As it is in the center of our building the kelp flies like to hang in the dead air and, well…just hang around circling in a tight mid-air area. They only are here until sunset and they depart and die.   It’s just living at the beach, nothing to do at all with sanitary conditions, cleanliness, or humanly. It’s just nature at the beach.

Our room was ocean/balcony front and we completely enjoyed the views and having our breakfast on the balcony.  The weather was perfect, was warm starting early in the day.  I did mention that it was our anniversary when making the reservation and fresh rose petals were scattered on our bed and around the bathtub.  It was lovely and added to the specialness of the stay.  It is a little pricy but we wanted something out of the ordinary for our anniversary.

5 helpful votes,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Overpriced !!!,"On our honeymoon from Ireland, we decided to splash out on a 3 night stay at Casa Tropicana.  We were expecting a luxurious stay for the price we paid.  But we had a number of issues which dissappointed us:  1. Our ""ocean view"".  While the view from our room was fab, the fact that anyone staying on our floor, the floor above us or any of the staff could pass our window (as in directly in front of our window) or sit on the shared decking (again directly in front of our window), meant that we did not at any stage open the blinds (as shown in the website photos).  So our ""ocean view"" that we were so looking forward to was redundant.  2. The train - we were told on arrival that there is a train and had to sign a sheet saying we had read that there was a train passing  - highly",September 2012,none,none,"Congratulations on your wedding and honeymoon.  I am glad you decided to come to San Clemente to celebrate it. But I’m very sorry you felt we disappointed you. After reading your review, I questioned my staff about your stay. From my general manager to our housekeeper, they said you both seemed to love it here. They said your comments were all positive and they had no clue you were unhappy. At checkout time my manager said you very much enjoyed your stay. You have given me quite a list of grievances so I’ll try to address each one for you. At least I can try to give you an explanation.   1. I just had the same comment regarding our ocean view decks in the review before yours. I explained that our ocean view decks are unbeatable. They are common decks for rooms on the second & third floor.  Again this is very much a part of the character of our inn. Our guests love being able to meet and make new friends on their decks. Many times over the last 22 years neighbors have met each other for the first time right here on these decks. For more privacy, I’d recommend the third floor with only 2 rooms on it. Or the Casa Del Rey Penthouse with its completely private deck.  2. Trains. First, that’s not fair! Our registration form does state trains run along the tracks and are required by law to sound their horns at the crossings. This is California, land of the lawyers. It also discloses, you agree to pay for your room, smoking in the rooms is $125, no pets, missing key and parking remote charges, check-out times, and so on. It’s not unusual, its litigation land. It is true there is a train track between the beach and us. This is no secret. The train tracks are highly visible when you check in. We have it on our website and many guests have commented on it right here on trip advisor. The large majority are not negative about it, and say it adds to their southern California experience. They do run mostly during the commuter hours of the day. And we do get a freight or two sometimes at night. Sue and I live on the property and we honestly don’t hear them at night. We’ve become used to them. I also wished you would have let us know about you desire for air conditioning. We have several rooms with AC. Generally here at the beach it’s cool at nights, so our ocean front rooms don’t generally need AC.  3. Booking .com does list our common decks, and our private Casa Del Rey Penthouse private deck. As you noted our website accurately describes our decks as common, and private. With all of these booking engines out there we have experienced several miss representations. We have not been successful in correcting some of them. We have decided to no longer use booking.com. I apologize if our website photos were miss interpreted by you. But as you again pointed out, if you read the website you would have noticed that.  4. Your room was decorated with rose pedals on the bed, and in the bathroom. There was a full bottle of champagne and fully stocked mini fridge free of charge filled each and every day of your stay at no charge.  From anyone visiting us from Ireland, or anywhere in the world this should seem very special. I know this because we do this for every guest who arrives to stay with us. I would have hoped that would be considered special for your honeymoon. We however had no knowledge this was your honeymoon. I checked your reservation and there were no notes regarding this special occasion. Booking.com’s notes didn’t translate to our reservation system. I just wished you would have appreciated the free bottle of Champaign and rose pedals you seem to have overlooked. Although you say it’s not expected, your suggestion we overlooked it seems to imply it was required.  5. This brings us to our final point regarding booking.com and booking center tribulations. The total they sold you the room for was discounted by them to you. We did make the mistake of charging you our regular rate. My manager corrected this upon your check out and refunded the difference to you right there before you left the property.   Finally, you are one tough reviewer, but thank you for your comments. We have made some changes with your valued input. We will continue to try to relay correctly and accurately what we do have to offer our guests through our website, and on the phone. Thank you for taking quite a bit of time to let us know your thoughts.  Rick Anderson  Owner",none,none,none,none,none,none,102,283

The commuter trains run about every 40 minutes and give a nice blast as they come through San Clemente.  The intersection bell also starts ringing about 2 minutes before the train arrives. It is a bad sign when you see ear plugs on the night table.  This is no an Inn so much as it is a boarding house over a bar. The rooms are not air conditioned, and on a hot day, they stay warm all night because there is no cross-ventilation. You might have a room that looks out on a shared patio that everyone needs to walk by  as they go up and down stairs. You need to keep the door open because you would suffocate if you didn't.

I have eaten better at one of those motels",January 2012,none,none,"Every now and then we do get helpful reviews.  In this case some of the issues pointed out were for real, some not much. Sue remembered these guests. She checked them in. Mainly because of the complaint of the parking remotes, this seems to be the beginning of the end for us.   Sue did in fact give the guest three different remotes to access the parking garage. However, the failure was due to operator error. The remote’s were subsequently tested, and the gate opened in all three cases. They have before, and since been used without failure. Also in fact the sink was draining slowly. Thanks for that comment. Sue told me they mentioned when she checked them out that morning. I did clean out the drain the same day Sue told me about it. I would have been happy to do it while they were here, but was unaware. Thanks for the heads up.  I was also upset to hear about the charge of loud music till 1:00 am that night. I personally didn’t hear any. Sue and I live onsite. So I forwarded a copy of the review to the owner of Sunset’s downstairs, and here is his reply: We have never had music anywhere near 1 am. Our music ends at 11:00. Please give us the night of this alleged incident and a print out of the trip adviser report. I am confident that we will be able to show there was no music at that time. I have a noise monitoring system in place at the edge of the premises. This is the exact same unit that the police use to monitor noise complaints so we can insure there is no variance from one unit to another. Several times a night our managers are required to log the noise levels of the music to insure issues like this can be shown as untrue. We do this so that we can show the authorities that we are in line with the city rules and regs. Very truly yours, Damian.  He was upset at the accusation, and defended his noise policy vigorously. Again, no one else had any complaints about any loud music. There are no base instruments or drums allowed for the entertainment. The groups are small; 1-2 musician’s playing very mellow music mainly as back ground music. There is no dancing, and the entertainment is well received by guests as a way to enjoy the evening without having to leave the property. We both manage this very closely.  I also am sorry they were disappointed in their breakfast. There are several options for you to choose from.  Most guest reviews celebrate our breakfast. B&B’s have lots of perceptions from shared bath rooms to gourmet breakfasts. However, every inn is different and so are their amenities, which include breakfast. We serve what the vast majority of our guests want. Leaving room for that minority that isn’t as enamored with our customer motivated menu. I guess we just struck out with them. We’ve learned once that: I’m not happy rock gets rolling, a landslide of grief often follows, and it’s easy to get buried in it.  While they were here, they were both very friendly and seemed to love the place. We don’t know what happened that changed that. But something did. All we can hope is perhaps another visit might help change their opinion. We hope we have the opportunity. Rick/ Owner",none,none,none,none,none,none,114,283

When I first drove by, the hotel and overall location actually reminded me of a cross between Italian Riviera and charming southern California.  There's a slight Art deco style about the building--toss in head-on views of the Pacific, and you realize this is a real gem in wonderfully relaxed San Clemente.  The rooms were bright, cool, and very comfortable (wooden floors will always trump carpeting).  As for the staff, remarkably welcoming and efficient.

We both enjoyed spending some time on the ocean view decks with you during your stay. I remember how impressed you were with the architecture of our building. When I designed it in 1997, this is what I had in mind. San Clemente is referred to as, “The Spanish Village by the Sea.” Many of our guests throughout our 21 years of owning and operating the inn have commented on how Casa Tropicana reminded them of a Mediterranean style building.

The room did have some with rose petels on the bed and snacks, wine in the fridge. An afternoon wine and cheese it what I expected. I say expect because all the others I have stayed at anywhere have provided this or something like that everyday.  The fridge fillers were their version of afternoon wine and cheese.  The owners had a private get together right above our room all evening.  The trains run every several minutes (like maybe every 20-30) and they blow their horns when they pass. Not too bad until later in the night.  The tracks are right in front of the Inn.  A good bed and breakfast is not ncecessarily defined by the location but the connection which you make with the Inn",May 2011,none,none,"I’m sorry you didn’t find what you were looking for.  This review is hard to respond to. I’ve read it several times but the title, Not the Best Experience, keeps grabbing me. We constantly try to be on top of our game and unfortunately, we seem to have missed the target with this guest’s expectations. Thankfully, the majority of the review is positive but there are some valid disappointments and for this I apologize.  This guest writes he is looking for special touches and acknowledges a few of our favorites - fresh rose petals on the bed upon arrival, and a mini fridge with snacks, cheeses, juices and red & white wines (all complimentary, of course). But no afternoon wine and cheese service was upsetting to them.   After 21 years of owning and operating Casa Tropicana, I early on discovered being at the beach is quite different from most traditional B&B settings. As it relates to this topic, our guests don’t return for afternoon wine and cheese. A day at the beach will often transition into to sunset at the beach. Or while shopping around town they end up stopping into a local restaurant for wine and tapas. We even tried an afternoon offering; Tequila Sunsets, with margaritas and munchies. (All that lead to was the staff, Sue, and me getting too giggly from drinking alone, so as you can imagine, we had to quit that.) We wanted to offer our guests some wonderful inn-style treats while working with their more casual beach schedule - which is why we put bottles of wine and cheese in each in-room fridge, allowing guest to enjoy them at their convenience.   People rave about our breakfasts. With the objective of pleasing most, we have put together a large selection of hot and cold dishes, meat and veggie offerings, and house-made and tried and true store bought items. But again we seem to have missed the mark with this guest.  Regarding a private get together one evening - I plead guilty. Once a year our Rotary club hosts a Global Study Exchange with about 5 professionals from all over the world. This year Sue and I hosted 2 team members from the Netherlands. They stayed in our home on the fourth floor for 6 days and on that particular night, I confess we did host going away party for them. However, if you know any older Rotarians, they were gone by 9 PM. I am sorry for any inconvenience we caused to these guest’s. We really try to be considerate of everyone in our building.   As I said, Sue and I do live on site and are most often available. However, its sounds like on this day, we were enjoying a day off together, off site. At the end of the day we always come home and we do have a manager at the front desk when we’re not in. One more thing worth mentioning. We don’t smother you here with attention. We are committed to allowing the guests to enjoy their little get-a-ways. We do interact with guests, but we try to read them to see if they are receptive to our interjection. They paid for this time; we don’t like to steal it from them. This approach has proven to be the most successful way to respect each guest’s experience.  And, yes, I have been guilty of allowing a guest to simply drop off their keys and parking remote when they seem in a hurry and I’m not at the front desk. So now I’ll take the opportunity to say, ‘Thank you for staying with us and I wish you would return and meet Sue and I.

We try very hard to make sure everyone has a great time with us. From your review it seems the main thing that didn’t hit the mark with you was the room rate. Your stay was on a weekend and due to demand, and industry standard, our weekend rates are a little more. We are also small as you said, only having eight luxurious rooms right at the San Clemente pier and ocean front. With Jacuzzi tubs, fire places, flat screen TV’s, and hot fresh homemade breakfast’s, featuring Starbucks fresh ground coffee made in French coffee presses. You mentioned the parking being a few feet away from our building, but you didn’t mention it is also free of charge every night of your stay in a secured parking structure. Try to find that almost anywhere else today. Also normally we do have a two night minimum for weekend stays, but we made an exception in your case to accommodate your travel plans. Most guests love our offerings and find an abundance of value, especially in the honor bar you mentioned. Just as one example, we stock it daily the whole time of your stay with 25 items, no matter what you enjoy…at no extra charge. I don’t know of anywhere in the world that does that for free! So my conclusion is, you just didn’t stay long enough to enjoy all we do offer, and fall in love with us as most of our guests have done. But that’s okay, you can come back, and try again.

Yes the location is perfect and adds to the price but next time I will find an alternative as there are other places close to the beach (and two night condo rentals are not hard to find in this area either). I read the reviews before staying here and do sympathize with those who didn't like the breakfast (it didn't wow me and we didn't eat it), or the price. The train really was not that loud, nor the whistle as long as the train one mile from my house that I hear many a night. I didn't even need the ear plugs they provide.

I agree. $400.00 is a lot of money…especially in these tough economic times. Ocean front Casita Clemente’s posted room rate is $310 weekdays and $375 on the weekends for this large suite. I am very sorry you feel you didn’t receive the value our inn has to offer. Pricing is sometimes difficult to place.  From the tone of your comments, I see the over all experience with us was positive, and I think we lost you with the nightly rates. It was just more than you seemed willing to part with. And in your opinion, more than you wanted to spend. I completely understand.  I must point out that doesn’t necessarily translate to a bad experience or inadequate accommodations, but perhaps more than you wanted to justify spending to facilitate your expectations. I would like you to consider we strive to exceed every guest’s expatiations, but at the same time realistically concede to that impossibility. Our true goal is delight into the 95% range, and biased on our past guests comments and the following other reviews, I believe we are achieving it!   Thanks for your positive comments about our ocean view balconies, wines, champagne, snacks, and ability to unwind upon your arrival. Also one of our biggest complements, as you pointed out are our big comfortable beds. We are really glad you got out to enjoy some of our local restaurants and little specialty shops just up the street from our inn.  All of our rooms are very different, we like that. But our ocean view rooms do in fact view the ocean; it’s only about 150 yards in front of us, and impossible to miss. The style of the couch may have appeared to be vinyl, if it’s important, but I paid for leather.  From my perspective it does have back rest cushions, and one large pillow that could be confused for only one of three. Thanks for the suggestions on the bathroom lights and the full mirror I will take care of that.   I guess you could call the shower in Casita Clemente quirky. But my thinking when I built it was it is more like the traditional old fashioned porcelain claw tubs…only a lot larger. In the old cast iron tubs, they had an identical shower curtain that you pulled all around you and the shower head came from above. Ours is in a large Jacuzzi sweetheart backed tub for two with a raindrop shower head coming from the center of the tub in the same fashion.

Upon arrival on Saturday night we were shown to our second floor 'ocean view' room.  Immediately we noticed the 'common balcony' mentioned by the website was immediately outside our ocean view window.  If we wanted to see the ocean we had to look through the many people on the balcony literally inches from our room window.  Zero privacy.

And I will also agree, sometimes guests fail to respect other people’s sanctuary. Our inn sits on a lot that is 40 feet wide and 80 feet deep, it was very hard to fit all we have here in our five stories and get all the privacy we would love to provide all of our guests. The majority of time our guests are very respectful and considerate of each other. I am sorry that wasn’t your case.  However there are options. I have to guess you stayed in one of the ocean front rooms on the second floor. That floor has five rooms that for the most part quietly share the common deck. As I am sure you noticed, at night when we light the candles on your glassed topped whicker tables, and comfy cushioned chairs, the romantic Pacific and softly lit San Clemente wooden pier, hosted by the dark starry nights are so romantic, most couples sit in silence. As noted in several reviews, we provide a bottle of champagne, chardonnay, and merlot upon arrival…free to each and ever room. In my 19 years of owing and operating our inn, the vast majority of our guests take this special evening time to enjoy their provided drinks, crystal clear Catalina Island sunsets, and full moon beamed ocean to rekindle their relationships and appreciate where they have come to rest for that night. It is mostly quiet conversations and hand holding. With most guests coming and going to dinners and nightly entertainment at different times, it is unusual for more that two couples even share the decks at the same times.  On our third floor there are only two rooms that share the same sized deck as below, which are as wide as the whole building. This may provide more privacy for those seeking it. But the ultimate world wide room to enjoy just your selves is the fifth floor penthouse!   The whole floor and private gated deck is yours. Complete with your own 8 foot square Jacuzzi on the outside deck corner over look. A private outdoor dry sauna for two, with your wet bar and refrigerator stocked full of free goodies and adult beverages as in every room. If anyone is looking for privacy, you will never beat this experience.  I must let every one know, Sue and I live on site! Our home is on the forth, and rear of the fifth floor. The inn is NEVER unattended. Having only 8 rooms it is impractical to operate a 24 hour front desk. All anyone, anytime needs to do to contact staff or ourselves, is dial the Casa Tropicana phone number, (949) 492-1234. You can always contact someone 24 hours a day that way. Please no midnight condo salesmen, thank you. And sorry, just one more thing….there is a train, its does go by, and each engineer may sound a horn at different levels.

But as I mentally chalked up the complaints in my mind during my stay, the less enthusiastic I became about the cute B&B we discoverred..  For this kind of money, you expect total pampering and a killer view from your room. You don't get either at CT. The minimalist staff is hard to find when you need them. The view is only applicable to the shared balconies out front.  The rooms are adorable, but showing lots of signs of wear and tear. The layout of the property can't be changed, so you'll just have to deal with people walking right by your window, which means that glimpse of a view is a moot point anyway. You'll need your blinds closed",January 2008,none,none,"I am sorry your stay was not wonderful for you. I don’t know how much was paid as our rooms run from $285 to $775 nightly. They include Jacuzzi tubs, champagne, merlot and chardonnay wines, and lots of munchies, including great Pacific Ocean views you talked about. We are glad it could be your, “Favorite place in all the world.” And I appreciate your comments on how we can work to make it better for you. I will admit in the slowest periods of December and January, we do employ a minimal staff. But as it is our slowest time, it’s also the best time to come and not be over crowded on our beaches and enjoy fantastic Catalina sunset views, and the un crowded wonderful restaurants we have to offer here in San Clemente. In our 8 room B&B Inn, the main ocean view is from the front windows and decks as they face the ocean, but also guests can walk by, as with most outdoor corridors. I will look into the noisy plumbing; I can only assume it’s a maintenance item. I built the building in 1990 and used solid cast iron waste pipes, I strapped and insulated copper for water, and fully insulated every plumbing wall in the building. My wife, Sue and I just completely refurbished and repainted the whole building just last May of 2007, so I will look for additional, “Signs of wear and tear.”  The breakfast however is in a state of change. Since I built the building, I owned and operated Rick’s Tropicana Bar & Grill that was located on the first floor. I have recently sold the restaurant and the new owner is not open for breakfast. You may have noticed I have taken out one of our units and through building permits we are constructing a new kitchen on the third floor. I apologize for the temporary inconvenience, but we will be improving on our breakfasts. Please come visit us again. Rick Anderson, Owner",none,none,none,none,none,none,219,283

The price is a bit steep (~$300/night) but given the prices in Laguna Beach of mere Holiday Inns I thought it was a great deal.  The rooms are lovely.  Really unique with special touches.  Who doesn't love a complimentary bottle of white wine, one of red and a bottle of champagne?  Also, a pre-packed beach bag with chairs, towels and games?!  Perfect.  Nice decor, some of the softest beds I've ever slept on and a beautiful hibiscus and shell necklace upon arrival.  The patios are shared but there was never anyone else on them when I was out there.  The view of the ocean and the pier is gorgeous and I sat for hours reading my book and listening to the waves.

The ocean view patios are very large and comfortable and as you mentioned, and mostly un crowded. The second floor shares the ocean view deck with five rooms, the third floor only with two rooms. Guests can use any one of the decks as they choose, or as your privacy needs dictate. On the fifth penthouse floor, Casa Blanca is a private deck complete with an outdoor 8 person Jacuzzi, dry sauna and wet bar! (Which hold your complementary chilled champagne and chardonnay, you will find your merlot waiting in your room.) Thank you for mentioning the train. As Sue and I live here onsite, we are used to its whistle, and often forget it does come by nightly. We are glad you enjoyed the sounds of the crashing waves, and the trains that compete for your attention. Sensitive sleepers should take advantage of the ear plugs, as they are very comfortable, but a few may find necessary. I am glad you hit on one of our most important features, our comfy over stuffed beds. We can only say, come back and try them again. Hope to see you again soon!

Over the last 18 years that we have been here, we rarely have a guest who cannot tolerate the train. I apologize, sincerely. The beach is literally 150 yards before you here at Casa Tropicana, and the train tracks do run between us, from San Diego to Los Angeles. The main advantage is it also stops right at our front door! So if a guest was so inclined they could arrive by train, enjoy our little 8 room inn, walk and shop the shops on our downtown Avenida Del Mar, dine in any one of our fabulous restaurants, return to our wonderful over stuffed beds, and board the morning train back to your destination! Sounds like true romance to me! But, that’s just me. I really know trains are not for everyone. You are correct about the spa. We did remodel a room and changed to become an Inn & Spa, but it didn’t work for our location. Guests found too many other things to do once they arrived and rarely made, or kept spa appointments. So now I have taken out the spa room and converted into Casa Bahama, a two room suite. (Check it out at, casatropicana.com)  Some of our old marketing material is still out there, but if you arrive for a spa treatment, we do call our technicians and can get you a treatment in your room. The more notice the better. Thanks for your comment about our name having, “Spa,” in it. We have now changed to, “Casa Tropicana, a Boutique Beach Front Inn.” Sorry about your assessment of our breakfast, I have recently sold the restaurant and the new owner is not open for breakfast. You may have noticed I have taken out one of our units and through building permits we are constructing a new kitchen on the third floor. I apologize for the temporary inconvenience, but we will be improving on our breakfasts soon. The, “weak,” coffee is however “Kona Coffee from Hawaii.” Let us know what you like and we can see of we can get it.  Being here at the beach the need for air conditioners is not in big demand. I have however, over the last few years added three AC’s to as many rooms. My goal is to put AC’s in all of the rooms when possible. Thanks for letting me know it counts. Bed & Breakfast Inns are by their nature social places, everyone is friendly. As for parking, I can assure it’s very safe and so is anyone who stays with us. It is not on a, “Condo lot,” as you know. It is in a secured parking structure that you were issued a parking remote just to enter and depart with. My Wife and I live here on site, and we have six grown kids raised here, with an additional six grand kids whom are perfectly safe anywhere in our neighborhood, on the beach and pier. I don’t honestly think a comment about feeling unsafe is a justified fair comment. We will disagree on that one. As for flies, open doors, being on top of each other, neighbors talking, and unpleasant experience, I don’t know how to comment any further on that, except to say I am very sorry to say perhaps Casa Tropicana wasn’t best suited for you.

The new manager lied to me and told me that they couldn't put me in the room I requested weeks before my husband was coming home. I found out she lied from a young man that worked there. I guess they do this stuff all the time, when somebody offers them more money. When I confronted the owner he was very rude, and could care less. This was supposed to be an amazing day for us (and it still was), but they definately stressed me out. It made me so mad that had no respect for our military, and my husband fought for our country- but to them money was more of a priority. Plus, it was very overpriced. Trains wake you up all throughout the night, and the manager is so snobby and makes you feel below her. I would",February 2007,none,none,"I resent this whole miss interpretation of fictional events. It only proves there are people out there who will do anything to wreck you. I vividly remember this event. The woman was given a gift certificate we donated to the Wife’s of Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, our neighbors the south. We donate thousands of dollars worth of rooms yearly to local events. This gift certificate was given to her by someone else and it was already expired when she first called. Policy being what it is she was politely informed it was expired. Non relenting as she was, she demanded to talk to the owner. I talked to her, I listened and decided to extend the certificate for her. No marine’s wife knows three months in advance when her husband will be released from deployment and returned home. They change arrival dates up until the time they leave. She could not, nor did not make reservations three months in advance! She in fact changed several times and we told her she could not keep doing this or the expired certificate would be voided. In the end I honored it and they came. Our rooms are given out to donated gift certificate holders biased on availability at the time of arrival. We give you the best available room when you arrive. She had one picked out, and was honestly told if it was not taken when she arrived she could have it, but it wasn’t available on the date she finally did arrive. This single event started the whole mess down hill. There was no bringing her back. This is why she says, “ I guess they do this stuff all the time when someone offers more money,” It was made very clear to her she could have any room biased on availability, but all of our rooms are for sale, and if one sells, for money, its gone out of inventory. We would have given her the penthouse if it was available! I support our troops! I truly resent her pulling the, “ No respect for our troops,” card, that’s about a low as a blow that can be made to any business that gives on request to support the men and women in uniform of this great nation in any time of war or peace! The woman, stayed for free, on an expired certificate, and states above, “It was to be an amazing day, and still was.” Then Stresses out because she could not get the room she wanted as we did not have it available for her to choose from, then she calls my people snobby, and then finishes by stating, it was very over priced, when in fact it was free!

Not only that but I have installed a new fixed rain shower head in the center of the large Jacuzzi tub so now, thanks to your comment the hand held shower is OUT! I agree, it wasn’t too practical.

8 helpful votes,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Very Disappointing,"I chose this B&B based on the glowing reviews on this site.  Turned out that my stay was very disappointing given how expensive it was.  I was concerned about one of the other reviewers complaints about construction noise, but I chalked that up to bad luck.  I had a bad experience that was a little more typical, I believe. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a terrible place to stay, but it certainly isn't cheap.  I paid $412/night for a Sat. and Sun. night.  Bottom line:  Wasn't worth it.  First, the good: -Location, location, location.  If you like the beach, then you might like this place.

They are done now and that is no longer an issue. As far as the trains, yes we have them and they do pass at night. We try to tell our guests and do provide the ear plugs. Honestly we found this to be more of an issue in cases like this when a portion of the stay was noisy over all. I am not denying the concern, but want to say most of our guests don’t comment or do enjoy the trains. I built this 5 story building in 1989 from the ground up. I am a general contractor and want the world to know the suggestions of, “poor sound insulation and cheep design,” are far from true. This building is constructed with R- 19 insulation in all common walls, floors and ceilings. Rooms are framed from 2”X6” studs or cement full grouted block they have ½” sound board behind 5/8” type X sheetrock, (drywall.) All floors have 1-1/2” poured-in-place light weight concrete below the carpet or hardwood finishes. Ceilings also have R-19 fiberglass insulation between the joists and the 5/8” drywall is on sound channels to provide additions space insulation from floor and ceiling joist to reduce sold sound transmissions. Doors are solid core, and all windows are dual glazed glass for additional sound reduction. There is nothing that existed in 1989 to reduce sound that was not used in the design and construction of this building. That said, I do apologize for the noise you heard upstairs. From the description of the room you are commenting about, I know above you is where I live. We are very sensitive to our guests below.  I can only think at the times you experienced noise from above, we either had a dinner party in our kitchen above, or any one of our 6 grand kids could have been giving Thomas the Train a workout above you, sorry. We really do try to keep it down, but this time, it was us! I did replace the hand shower in that room to a full shower head. I did receive a lot of comments about it. Thank You.
