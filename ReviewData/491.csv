At first it was a nice place to stay, quiet and they seemed to care who they rented to. The place was kept up and the managers/owners seemed to care about what was going on there. Then, the owners/mangers moved and brought some younger people in to work for them when they aren't there. Since then, they haven't seemed to care about anything that goes on there. They are quick to take your money, but they don't fix ANYTHING. There is no air conditioning in any of the rooms and you even have to pay for clean towels and sheets now, even if you are paying by the day. They will promise you anything to get you in there, but once you are there, its a different story.The Villa has",April 2015,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,491
