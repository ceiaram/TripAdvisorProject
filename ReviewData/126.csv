Health club is reasonably small with only 1 exercise bike with most other equipment being step or walk/running machines. Room provided coffee machine is very ordinary and tastes like detergent.

What you are describing are not indicative of bed bug bites, a problem hotels across the world are unfortunately periodically experiencing with the outlawing of pesticides that previously kept those issues under control. International guests will unintentionally transfer these pests in their luggage and airline travelers will pick them up even on airplanes and in movie theatres. Because bed bugs hide in mattresses and come out at night, bites are usually seen on the trunk part of the body (back, chest, shoulders), not ankles.

Front desk service is remarkably efficient and friendly, both at check in and check out. The Starbucks (not a company location) in the lobby is a nice addition with friendly staff. Breakfast was the only disappointment. After paying a hefty valet parking fee (to be expected I guess if you are next to South Coast Plaza) to avoid the only slightly less hefty self parking fee, I didn't expect to have to pay for the breakfast buffet as a Silver member, especially since it was very limited.

The best part of the stay was the professionalism of the staff, both during checkin and at checkout. I arrived rather late on a Saturday night and there was a church event going full blast, so I requested and got a very quiet room away from all the noise and music. The room was quiet even though it faced busy Bristol Street.   The room was clean, the bed comfortable, the bathroom had the usual Hilton amenities and plenty of towels.   I would definitely stay at this hotel again!",May 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1502,126

8 helpful votes,2 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not memorable, and offensive at times","Stayed here for 3 nights, 8/25-8/28/04.  It's a very business-oriented place...if you're not attending a convention or meeting you may feel a bit out of place.  The bathroom was great -- very well lit.  There were mirrors throughout the room.  Other room amentities were above-average: excellent central air conditioning/heating, lots of cable TV channels, colorful decor, etc.  Location is also great...right off the 405 freeway, walking distance to South Coast Plaza mall, and across the street from a McDonalds and Circle K convenience store.  HOWEVER, the Hilton Cosa Mesa loses lots of points because its staff lacks professionalism.  Be prepared for the housekeepers to pound on doors in the early A.M. shouting, ""Housekeeping!"" And each time I'd walk past the platoon of college",October 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1505,126

Super clean and an awesome gym to boot.  Food was excellent.  Unfortunately,  you'll pay about $9 to park your vehicle.  Hotel is located right near a huge mall with plenty of places to shop and/or eat. I'd stay again.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1506,126

Staff seemed like they didnt care after about 3 different complaints they finally responded. Be careful, high volume business district type hotel. But, if you want something nice and somewhat reasonable in a decent area, you might find a bargain here. I can sometimes bypass service if I think I received a bargain.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1507,126
7 helpful votes,3 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Lovely modern accomodations - Horrible experiences with staff,"The GOOD first ... beautiful lobby, a stylish open-air restaurant/bar area, great gift bargains in the gift shop, modern, cool room interiors, sparkling clean bathrooms, a private balcony, covered parking, yummy, fast room service, VERY nice gym, warm hot tub and nice pool, excellent on-site technical help with the high-speed in-room internet access. The BAD ... I don't use credit cards and the room service staff never had any change so they always got a really big tip! how convenient lol ... I was assigned a non-smoking room but requested a smoking room. Realizing this AFTER I had unpacked everything, I had to run back down to the front desk, get a new key, go back up to the old room, pack everything up and switch. The staff said it was fine that I had two room keys to two",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1508,126

The staff was so nice and accommodating and the food was wonderful. They worked hard to make our convention and stay a success. The lobby was very nice and airy. The staff was helpful in every way. The grounds were nice and well kept, the pool and hot tub area were nice as well. We would stay here againg!",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1509,126
