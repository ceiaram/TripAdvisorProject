I able to check in very fast which is a big plus after being in business meetings all day. The staff was very friend and told about the free Wi-Fi and free morning meal. When I went to my room it didn't look like any Extend Stay I had ever stayed at before. I t was very modern and clean. The bed was very soft and had plent of pillows. I had fresh fruit,oatmeal, and coffee the next morning for free. I have now stayed at this hotel 6 times over the last two months and I will keep coming back. They say you get what you pay, but this is one of those few times in life I felt like I got more then my more worth.

I am a frequent business traveler and was my bad luck I checked in here. At checkin I gave my credit card and the lady at the checking counter said, I don't know if this card belongs to you. Could be stolen! So I need to speak to your bank to confirm you are who you r saying you are and if this card is yours. This is after we had given her our ids! The silly woman treated us shabbily like we were some theifs! I mean I was livid! She wasted 30 mins with her rubbish.  As a result we had to remove this extended stay from our list of hotels to stay in Brea for our company's list. We just saved some 28 people from our co from booking this place which treats guests so shabbily.  I should have probably charged these",May 2012,none,none,"Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at Extended StayAmerica Orange County - Brea.
