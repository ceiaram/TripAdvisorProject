In this respect its 11/10. You're in the heart of downtown Disney and connected to California Adventure. What else could you ask for? The hotel is very very well done. You can tell the lobby and grounds received the same care and detail as many of the attractions in the parks themselves. The staff is great and super friendly. Definitely a Disney signature. The only con is the actual room themselves. Don't expect your typical 4 star hotel room. Instead, expect a slightly lesser midrange Marriott accommodations.

That may be better for families with teenagers, who usually would break the bunk beds. I still find it a loss.  So I will explain the upgraded ration.

Just your average room with double beds, tv, mini fridge, plain decor, and the bathtub had a shower curtain.   That was the only downside though, we were pretty happy with everything else.

The lodge style is great, but the accommodation and dining dont come close to this and are more at the 3 star level - room set up and facilities are very much like a travelodge.

One can best judge a hotel by its actions rather than words. Our 17yr old son became very sick and needed to see a doctor. We are from Australia and quite unfamiliar with  U.S medical system and were at quite a loss. We rang guest Services and explained the situation to them. Within an hour a doctor arrived at our room. This was an astounding response the hotel had organised. We have travelled extensively and NEVER seen such an expeditious response to a medical condition.  Thank you to Management for their proactive systems in place for these events.  We found the Whitewater Cafe the perfect place for snacks and meals throughout the day.

But for all its cool features, I wouldn't call it a value pick. You're paying a lot of money for its location -- which, let's face it, may be enough for most travelers.  But as a hotel, it's very expensive for what you get. The downstairs area is very nice, with a large lobby area and a ceiling that goes all the way to the top of building.  It's themed very nicely -- evidently patterned after the Ahwahnee.  Cool, but you don't have to stay at the hotel to enjoy it.

All Disney rooms are the same, essentially--in layout and space--but in ""Deluxe Resorts"" you'll have more elaborate theming, more elaborate room service and more on-site activities (i.e. fantasy pools, movies at night, fancier restaurant options).   The closer you are to the park entrances, the more you pay.  Disney is a family entertainment company, not a luxury travel company so, if you are accustomed to paying for white-glove service, you need to book outside the resorts at a Four Seasons or Ritz property.

Attn Parents with Toddlers,"We just returned from a glorious vacation over Labor Day weekend lasting through September 9th with our two toddlers (almost 4 and almost 2).  It was the height of Labor Day crowds when we arrived on Saturday and yet everything was smooth from beginning to end.  We actually stayed in a 1 bedroom suite at the Disneyland Hotel for the 1st 2 nights and then stayed the last 4 nights (4th night free due to promotion) at the Grand Californian.  Yes, the Disneyland Hotel is a bit dated, but the size of the 1 bedroom suite was huge.  We arrived early so I didn't expect the room to be ready, but it was, so we were able to go straight to it.

The bottom line question: Is this place worth the price?  Well, the answer is YES, based on four criteria:  Location, Service, Concierge, and Security.  The location is beyond wonderful.  Whether you are a first-timer or veteran, you know there is serious walking involved with a Disney trip.  From your room to rides at DCA is less than 3 minutes through a private entrance.  The location allows you the flexibility to come and go to enjoy breaks, swimming, and relaxing.  Your nerves will thank you about 1PM that you are so close to your Hotel.

Other than a very unfriendly check-in person, the hotel is very conveniently located with easy access to the park.  My only complaint  was the long walk to the rooms and the hotel seems a lot larger compared to the Disneyland Hotel so it loses some of its cozyness.  The extra money for these hotels is well worth it and will make for great experience.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5104,66
6 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A Lot of Nice Surprises,We had a lot of nice surprises at our visit (12/19 - 12/21/02).  We had gotten a special rate of $209. / night and had agreed to a Disneyland drive view.  My husband asked if there were any rooms with a view available and the lovely check-in lady upgraded us to a pool / theme park view on the 5th floor near an elevator (Rm. 5324) at no additional charge.  What a view!!!  We pre-checked in at 9:00 am and since the room was available they let us move right in instead of having to wait until 3:00 pm.  That was so nice to be in our room early and ready to start our day at Disneyland at 10:00 am.  Our room had a queen bed with a bunk bed / trundle that conviently slept all three of our children.  The bell hop gave us a lot of good information and was extremely helpful.  The room was,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5105,66

I was impressed with the decor and the little extras that Disney always puts into the hotel theme. Likes: I love the location, the restaurants, the pool, and the decor.  Dislikes:  It was surprisingly noisey in the hallway with people and children talking. Reminded me of Motel 6 A resort fee of $20 a day is charged. I don't know why. Improvements:  They don't have a monorail stop at the hotel. That is a huge oversight.  There is no early entrance into Disneyland which I expected when staying on Disney property. Guest self parking is across the street. Amazingly far and not very guest friendly.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5106,66
none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,What a treat!,"When we booked our room at the Disney's Grand Californian, the cost almost changed our minds, but oh what a hotel.  We are very glad that we didn't cancel, and look forward to returning very soon.  Our view faced the grand rapids attraction, the waterfalls looked and sounded fabulous.  The view was just the icing on the cake though.  Our room was spacious and housed all the amenities that we could of needed and then some. The staff was exceptional!  Very helpful with any requests and/or questions that we had.  We travel to Disneyland Anaheim resort several times a year and take our breakfast and lunch foods with us to cut the cost of feeding a family at the resort.  Our room had 2 good sized tables, one inside and one on the balcony which was excellent for morning coffee and",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5107,66

(however I hope to make it again) As we pulled up to the front gate and were asked our names, I became concerned, but to arrive at the door filled with costume adorned gentlemen ready to unload our car, I knew this would be great. They explained that checkout had just begun, but they would be happy to hold our luggage until our room was ready. We entered the huge wooden wall as it parted, and went inside a fantasy lodge. We checked in and were shown to our room. Immeaditaely my 2 yr old noticed the park from our balcony, and we had to leave. We were surprised at how easy it was to enter the park (a private guest entrance located downstairs next to the pool) We were even allowed to return to our room with the rented stroller our child was",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5108,66

I would recommend staying at the Californian over any of the other Disney resorts.  It is beautiful, you  are IN the park (a big advantage at the end of a long day!)  Service was incredible and if you watch what you are doing associated expenses need not ruin the budget.  I would recommend it to everyone!",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5109,66
