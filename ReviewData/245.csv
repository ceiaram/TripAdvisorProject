On check in they demanded a $500 deposit even though we had already paid in full through British Airways. After consulting with someone they reduced it to $50 which was fine. The male receptionist made us both feel like Kevin out of Home Alone. He was literally looking down his nose at us as if we shouldn't be staying there. The rest of the reception team were pretty much the same. The room was OK. We took up the offer of $5 a day for no maid service for 5 days of our stay. Be careful with the water.

The location is good, close to Disney and all of the attractions, but was very upset by the cleanliness of the pool.

Club lounge attendant was very nice, and the rooms were typical of a Sheraton (no balconies though). Hotel rooms were clean, and lobby was nice.

We go to DIsney a lot and have stayed at many hotels (Park Sheraton, Hojo, Park Plaza).

If you book with points it's about half as much as the Park Sheraton; however, if you are paying it's only $5-$50 dollars less, so check the price, because it might be worth the extra 5-10 to stay closer to Disney.

We were having breakfast at Disney early the first morning, and wanted to leave our car at the hotel, so we could catch the shuttle.  I was assured by the staff at the Sheraton when I called ahead that this would not be a problem.  We arrived at 7:30 am on Sunday morning, and I was welcomed at the front desk by two staff members, who informed me that I was welcome to check in at that point, and take any bags up to the room.

Charges for Every Little Everythings,"This hotel located in an awkward location.  right at the end stretch of Garden Grove/ Anaheim.  Which is quite ""far"" for Disneyland without shuttle (which is their target clientele).  However, the shuttle is NOT FREE. Here are the reviews:  Location: As mentioned above.  Not TOO far from the freeway, not too close either. Its located at the END of the Disney Hotel Circle (Yes, its the Last one located SW of Disneyland area) thus its Impossible to walk to Disney unless you have a car.  There's a target located right across from the hotel, McDonalds and other fast food chains located nearby .  Parking: This I find it hard to believe.  They charge $12/night for parking esp when the hotel occupancy rate is low enough at this property.  I understand other Sheratons (Sheraton Park,",June 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,697,245

We booked this hotel because we are SPG program members and because of the Buy 1 Night, Get 1 1/2 Off.   We paid only $178 for the two nights which was a pretty good bargain considering the icky and older hotels near Disneyland wanted to charge over $100 per night and aren't nearly as nice as this hotel.  We arrived a little past noon and our room was ready and were given a room on the 5th floor.  The lady at the front desk was very friendly and answered every question we had to ask.  Very knowledgable front desk staff to say the least.  Our room was very spacious, clean, and everything looked new.

Walking up to the hotel, it seems very new and is located adjacent to a ""block"" of hotels. While talking to the concierge, he advised the hotel was built in July, 2008.  As a SPG Platinum, I received an upgrade to a corner room on the 7th (highest) floor, which happens to be the floor to the Club Lounge. Key access is needed for this floor. The lobby is immaculate and has a large area dedicated to the new Link@Sheraton. The bar and restaurant always seemed empty. There is a little convenience store right beside the check-in desk. However, when I arrived on a Sunday, it was closed and the front desk had no idea how to open it - although there was a sign to contact the front desk if you needed to buy anything.",June 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,699,245
183 helpful votes,256 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Ok option if only going to Disney,"This just is not a Sheraton.  I think Starwood is getting confused about what each of its products are supposed to be, and what they are supposed to offer.  I never knew that Sheraton's were business travelers hotels.  Because this is really what this hotel is.  From the moment you step into the lobby, to the nice room with a large desk to do work, to the workout room and pool, this is a businessman's hotel.   Staff was nice.  They allowed us to check in at 1030am, and since we are Starwood Platinum Preferred members we were put on the 6th floor, which I guess is more special then the others since it has a great view of ..of ... nothing.  Well unless you count the parking lot we paid to park in that had 10 cars in it. That said, the location as it relates to Disneyland is",June 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,700,245

The staff was very attentive, we stayed 4 days and 3 nights, 3 of us total, my husband, me and my 2 year old. We were their for disneyland. They have a shuttle that takes you to and from disneyland which is right outside the hotel. Its a little to far to walk, maybe like a 15 min walk but if you dont mind walking it is a great walk if the weather is nice! The hotel was very clean and everything was new and very modern.

I would certainly stay there again for the price, but if I had to pay rack rates, I might opt for some where closer to Disneyland. The room was modern and clean. The staff was very nice. My only complaint is the shuttle to the park was very slow. We spent quite a bit of time waiting for it and on more than one occasion it filled immediately and we were stuck waiting another 10-30 minutes for the next one.

73 helpful votes,99 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My favorite hotel near Disneyland,"One downside.  $12 for parking in a lot that was never even 1/4 full.  The hotel is brand new.  Check-in was pleasant and efficient.  Nice restaurant and bar.  We didn't notice much noise if any from other rooms or from the street.  The beds were very comfortable.   Convenient computer stations in the lobby that give you 30 minutes of free time to check in for a flight or whatever.   My favorite hotel in the area used to be the Marriott Suites, but our last three stays had problems.  Rooms weren't made up until late.  Once they lost my $100 gift check and they started to get picky about the time they would let us check in.  At 4 PM, they should have a room ready.  Anyhow, the Sheraton is very convenient (they even let us check in once at 10:30 am!)  The web site makes it sound",November 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,704,245

With that, we booked a room at the Sheraton Garden Grove.  It is new.  Yes, parking is $12 night-yikes. We really looked forward to the Sweet Sleeper bed.  We were assured on-line that they had this bed.  What we experienced was a very firm mattress with a thin mattress pad.  My bones ached and had to get up early because I could not take ""the pain"" of it all.  When I commented to the front desk staff, I was assured that every bed was a Sweet Sleeper--not in my room!!

The front-desk, restaurant, maid and all customer-contact staff were friendly, motivated and did everything possible to ensure customers were well looked after.
