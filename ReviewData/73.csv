Upon check in Lizzie was gracious and patient as it took some time for my credit card to accept their incidental charge. We pre-paid for our room upon arrival & weren’t planning on charging to our room during this stay since we’d be at Disneyland. So I asked them to waive the incidental charge. So Lizzie kindly asked their floor manager but she rudely replied & would not make an exception due to hotel policy.  So BEWARE of their $250 incidental charge in addition to your booking. This did not drop off of my card until 1 week!!  We finally made it to our room.

First off, on the second night of stay I returned late to hotel only to find no valet working at all ($42 a day for valet and I had to park myself) so a security guy came up and told me to park my car out front of hotel and said nothing about dropping off keys to front desk.

I’m not sure exactly what this place is trying to be, but for a hotel less than a mile from Disneyland, it misses the mark. Hell, it misses the mark for a “4.5 star” hotel regardless of location.   The front desk staff was consistently rude and acted like they were doing you a favor by being there or answering the phone. Zero courtesy, not even polite. At a 4.5 star hotel, by definition, you’d expect bellhops or at least for someone to offer to help you with luggage (especially when traveling alone with two small children).
