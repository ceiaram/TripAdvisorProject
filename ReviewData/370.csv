9 helpful votes,82 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't wast your money here.,"We stayed here for 3 night in August 2013. This hotel is one of the worst places to stay. There is no carpet on the floors, its laminate flooring so you get to hear every thing above you when kids are running around in the middle of the night. There is no dressers, and the beds are well lets just say the mattress slide all over the place, there on some kind of wooden pedestal. But if you don't mind cheap and lots of floor noise. There is no breakfast at all. I mean NONE. The only + side to this hotel is the staff were great and eager to help you out.

The rooms were very spacious, clean and well maintained with good air con. A special mention must be given to Raj on the front desk who we quickly learnt was the manager. A happy guy who went above and beyond to help us with any questions, giving recommendations on where to eat and drink and even threw in a bit of footy banter. We will be back to buy him a drink or 2!

It is within walking distance to the park (about ten minutes). There is a plaza with all kinds of restaurants about a 5 minute walk and 7-eleven around the corner. The rooms were clean and basic. The a/c worked great. Plenty of towels and pillows. The mattresses are really firm but we prefer them that way. There was decent water pressure. The only things we found odd/annoying were- no fridge, closet type doors for the bathroom (no lock), remote didn't work properly (we asked for new batteries), no blow dryer, and the door on our second room would get stuck closed. They were only minor inconveniences. We enjoyed our stay and felt safe especially considering they have a security guard walk the grounds at night.

10 helpful votes,7 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Clean but sparse,"The pros:  the room is clean and has been recently remodeled.  It has a very modern feel, with laminate wood flooring, new counters/sinks, etc.  The rate was reasonable, and it only took us about 10 minutes to get to Disneyland. The cons:  WiFi is only for one device, so if you have a phone and a laptop, you only get WiFi for one.   The laminate flooring can seem cold and not inviting.  There is no blow dryer!  I've never stayed anywhere that didn't provide a blow dryer.  No shampoo/conditioner provided-- I've never seen this either.  The soap was extremely puny, and almost didn't make it through our showers.  The water pressure was pretty bad in the shower.  Not in a great neighborhood.

6 helpful votes,3 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Never again would I stay here,"This was absolutely horrible.  I realize that it's a low rate room in comparison, but it still needs to feel clean.  When you first walk in, it appears to be very modern and spacious.  Once I looked closer I was horrified.  There was a wod of hair on the blanket on the bed, the bathroom walls were filled with mold, the mirror was filled with rust, there was hair on the floor and it was just gross.  It really needs to be repaired before anyone else stays in this room. I asked for clean blankets and they brought me a blanket filled with cigarette burns.   Very disappointing.

It is in kind of a strange area and away from the rest of the Disney resort area a bit, but it was totally worth it. The prices were better than most anything else I could find and the quality was way above what I would have expected for the price.   The day of check in, Raj called to see if we needed any assistance on directions to the hotel. Once we arrived, he was very friendly in person as well and checked us in right away. The room was very nice and super modern for a Motel 6. The pictures don't lie... it truly is beautiful for a budget hotel!

After explaining that I'd asked for a two-day stay but would stop by the desk to rectify the situation in about an hour management seemed dissatisfied and was very curt upon my arrival to correct the charges.
