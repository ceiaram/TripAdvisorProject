27 helpful votes,73 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Exactly what I needed,"I was skeptical about booking this hotel due to others reviews. I did and thankful I did. It was exactly what I needed, a clean hotel to spend the night en route to another destination. Clean room, spacious , fridge and no one disturbing us.  Sure it was in a sketchy part of town, but maybe the whole town is?, Its not where I would live myself but exactly what I wanted and needed. I would recommend it for this purpose.

I hate to spend much whenever we need a place just to sleep verses staying for a few days or more.  So I decided to give this a try by booking through TripAdvisor.  Booking through TripAdvisor was a breeze, but the motel however was a disappointment.  On the plus side check-in was smooth and easy.  We arrived about 8pm and the lady behind the window was very nice and the aroma slipping through the pass through smelled delicious.  I think they were having dinner when we arrived.  I was presented with a credit card preauthorization which was higher than the amount quoted.  I asked why and she explained they charge a $20 refundable deposit.  So ok, paid",July 2016,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,374

We drove around the block at 1:30 midnight and found another nearby for 2 of us.

It was nine at night and all we needed to do was sleep and go to Disney.  We were so lucky to find the West Coast motel.  The room was clean, great shower, good beds, micro and fridge for breakfast use, good ventilation and quiet for sleeping.  We paid 80 bucks.  We were at Disney in 15 minutes with slow road construction issues.  Went right to the Buzz Lightyear lot and then five minutes into the park.  Super great place if you do not need all the fluff.  McDonalds was very close too.",June 2015,All the rooms seemed nice.,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,374
