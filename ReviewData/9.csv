I was placed in a Surf Inspired room-Bilabong and omgosh this hotel is nothing like any other hotel I've ever stayed at. I loved that each room was it's own theme and had its own charm. Mine had a window facing the ocean which was unreal!  It's literal steps from a beach entrance, with a cute bench to take in the morning sun and waves or to recharge midday.  The Rooftop (restaurant on the top level of the hotel) is a MUST- sunset is not to be missed (and if it's a colder day they supply blankets), staff is very attentive and menu is delicious. Also, a great spot for lunch/brunch.

We arrived a little before check in, but they were able to accommodate us and check us in early.  Parking in their offsite lot is free, which makes dropping off bags a little tricky.  We were directed to a loading zone on the side street and a porter met us with a luggage cart to take our bags to the room while I checked us in and my SO parked the car.  The room was very spacious and decorated in surf theme.  We had an ocean facing view (over the rooftops).

The service at the hotel was great, and the location was good, as it is walking distance to many restaurants and shops and is maybe a 15 minute walk to the main beach area.  My only major criticism is that the hotel is quite dated.  My Spanish queen room was very small, and the furniture and decor all had a very outdated feel, and is very much in need of modernization.  The hotel lobby similarly has a dated feel/vibe to it, and the carpeting throughout the hotel is old and worn looking.

The hotel itself appears to be doing a fine job of keeping up and improving a historic near-icon of Laguna Beach.  That's great to see.  Also, their tapas restaurant is excellent.  La Casita is a small house adjacent to the hotel.  It's down from Highway 1 and quiet.    Downstairs there are two bedrooms and a full bath, a third small bedroom and small bath, a living-dining area with gas fireplace.  Furnishings are simple but generally comfortable.  Owners need to upgrade the sheets and bedding.  The upstairs has a very small bathroom and shower, a sitting room, and a deck.  As is, this is wasted space because the sitting areas only have two uncomfortable chairs each.  Advice to owners:  put in two sofa chairs, or a bed,",January 2022,none,none,Very much appreciate your feedback and thank you so very much for staying with us!

The included morning breakfast wasn't elaborate, but actually prefect. The afternoon wine and cheese was great. The rooftop bar is worth seeing. Note - it's hard to get a reservation there. If you really want a table there's a $150 charge which seemed a bit much. However given the view am guessing it keeps people from squatting. Just get there early for sunset and be patient.

For most of the day, our entire group wound up at the ""strictly enforced"" metered parking on the streets around the hotel. The location is the only thing that justifies the $250+ a night rate.

First the parking is one block away up a slight incline and you have to bring your luggage by foot and across the street to get to the hotel.  The hotel is an very old building and has a bar and a restaurant on the main floor.  The hotel is on a hill so several levels but there is a small elevator.  When we arrived the 2 lady clerks were not very welcoming and when we walked away to our room we heard one say ""its going to be one of those days""  We were shocked to find the room really small and dark and right on the street next to an exit door that was wide open.  They offered another but it was even smaller.  They did not look like the picture we saw.

La Casa del Camino is an old, semi-historic hotel, very close to the beach and is right downtown in Laguna Beach, close to shopping, bars and restaurants. In fact, there are two bars in the hotel, including a roof-top bar with awesome views. I view this as the high point of the hotel(no pun intended). Seriously, if you like bars with a view, this would be one reason to stay here. At the very least you should stop in for a drink  and check out the views of the coastline.

We’re absolutely delighted to hear that you think of our place as “unique, different and refreshing” because that’s the exact image we aim to create. Our idea of unique, different and refreshing doesn’t just end with the style/themes of our hotel rooms as we believe this also applies to our team of employees. Each member of our team, from the hotel to the restaurant and lounge above, share a common goal of making sure our guests are comfortable while still maintaining their unique character as an individual which we believe helps with making our guests feel relaxed as if they are at home.   We are excited that you enjoyed your room; the Billabong surf room. All of our rooms are very nice and have a unique quality to them but the Billabong room has proven to be a favorite for return visitors because of the gorgeous sweeping views of the Pacific. If you choose to stay with us again in the future, we urge you to explore our other types of rooms as we believe you would enjoy any room as equally as you enjoyed the Billabong room.   There are many perks to look forward to as a guest of the hotel including the breakfast buffet and 24 hour access to the rooftop. One perk you may not be aware of is the ability to request a reservation for the rooftop lounge given we have the availability to accommodate on the day of your request. This is extremely beneficial as we normally charge a fee for reservations at the rooftop lounge and as you know, it gets really busy due to it being such a popular hangout for its stunning views.

Rooms were clean and well decorated. The staff is AMAZING. Maybe the best ever. Prices are good for what you get. The rooftop bar is out of this world - well the view is out of this world - the drinks suck. Location is fantastic for enjoying Laguna Beach by foot. They'll even deliver chairs to the nearby pocket beach to you.   The reason I can't wholeheartedly recommend the hotel is that they can't make up their mind whether to be a party place or a hotel, and both don't work in an old building with thin walls.

I am so sorry to hear that you felt forced to pay for an upgrade, as this was not our intention! In looking back on your reservation, I found you had booked a Deluxe Queen Non-View room, which is the same room size as any of our Deluxe Queen rooms, at about 175 sq ft. Unfortunately, we did not have a Deluxe King Non-View room available during your stay (which is the room you saw on the first floor) or we would have happily offered you the Deluxe King room first (we have only 2 of these rooms, both located on the first floor). Being peak season, and since we are a very small boutique hotel of only 36 guest rooms, we fill up quickly.

The cost of this room is typically $100 more than our Deluxe Queen rooms, as it offers so much more space, a beautiful ocean view, and a larger bed. We offered the upgrade to you at only half the cost, and we regret to hear it was not a worthwhile upgrade for you.

They will take chairs and towels down to the beach for you and the beach access is just steps away.

I am the person who checked you in, and I apologize if it may have seemed as if I were bored... I was in fact very busy on the afternoon of your check-in. Still, no excuse for not being more enthusiastic, and you have my sincere apology. I recognize you had requested an early check-in of 10am, which was not guaranteed. Check-out time for the guests staying the previous night is 11:30am, and we had a full house the night before your arrival. After check-out time, the room must be cleaned and prepared for the next guest's arrival, which can sometimes take a few hours for the housekeepers to get around to all the rooms. Our guaranteed check-in time is 3:00pm, and a request for earlier check-in is based on the availability of a clean room. Looking back on your reservation, you were granted an early check-in at 1:53pm, after I had verified that the room was clean and ready. It is unfortunate that an earlier check-in was not available, and I am very sorry that this has caused so much dissatisfaction for you.

We are sorry to hear of your disappointment in the size of your guest room. La Casa del Camino is a historical Laguna Beach property, circa 1920. We have just completed an extensive room renovation this year, and have decided to stay true to our historic Spanish style in which the property was originally built. Some of our rooms are quite small (namely our Deluxe Non View Queen, and Partial Ocean View Queen rooms), however they are original to the building and provide a truly unique experience for the open-minded. We do have in-room air conditioning units that take up a little floor space, however we have arranged them in the room as well as possible, understanding that most guests prefer to have an air conditioned room when it's hot outside. We are sorry that you found this to be an inconvenience.   We have negotiated with the local waste management company to have them pick up the neighborhood trash later in the mornings in an effort to minimize noise for our hotel guests.
