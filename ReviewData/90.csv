none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,4 nights in Anaheim,"We stayed in a room with 3 double beds. Location is great and Dennys for breakfast is just two houses away. Rooms are big enough for a short stay. Only things that could get improved: the room doesn’t have a clothes compartment, so you need to life out of your luggage. Second thing is, the washroom has no fan to put humidity out. Little window is not helping. So after the first shower of possible 6 persons the room is already wet everywhere. One little thing: the towels are kind of smal for tall persons. But I’m sure we could have more towels if we would ask.  In total a nice stay if you are just looking for a good bed to sleep.

The room is about what you’d expect for the price point. Nothing fancy, but it’s comfortable and clean. What really stood out to me was the service and friendly, accommodating staff. We had an early flight into LAX on a Friday, and a late flight out on Monday. The Alamo let us check in 2 hours early on Friday and check out 1 hour late on Monday. Plus they let us store our luggage in the lobby before we checked in and after we checked out, which allowed us to explore Downtown Disney without having to lug our bags around.

Great location for a great price. However, since reopening after the COVID-19 pandemic, ownership has used it as an excuse to cut down room cleaning to once every three days. Of course, in the grand scheme of things this isn't a huge deal--but one of the perks of staying in a hotel is the daily service--and worse yet cutting down cleaning to 1/3 of what it should be is affecting the cleaning staff's hours and income. The rates are the same as they were when cleaning was daily--now guests are paying the same and the staff is getting 1/3 of the hours they previously had--all so the owners can pocket the extra cash by using the pandemic as a non-sensical excuse. There is no reason not to have full service and",May 2022,none,none,"Thank you for taking time to share your feedback!  We are very happy to speak into some of your concerns.  What you have shared may describe many properties in the hospitality industry.  However, as a business, we feel strongly that our decisions have been driven by genuine care for our staff and guests, even if this meant that our owners would pocket less.  For instance, our ownership provided work for our employees through the pandemic even though many hotels laid off the majority of their staff by the Summer of 2020.  ~80% of our 2019 team are still on staff with us.  Regarding stayover cleaning protocols, the schedule was developed in collaboration with our frontline housekeepers.  We have nearly the same number of employees as we did in 2019 (the busiest year in Anaheim), but our employees have requested more time off for their families, reflecting a different priority in work-life balance following the pandemic, which we are doing our best to honor.  This naturally limits our capacity for stayover cleaning.  Please note however, that we welcome guests to request additional cleanings during the check-in process, and we do our best to schedule these in.  For your peace of mind, we have consistently provided full-time hours to the majority of our staff that want a full-time schedule.  While we may be a simple ""no-frills"" property, we take pride in how we operate, and we wanted to gently push-back on some of your assumptions (:",none,none,none,none,none,none,117,90

I made a reservation at this hotel and because of work which was beyond my control I had to cancel and I found out there is a $ 25 charge to cancel or change reservations. I have only heard of a charge if you cancel late. I cancelled the next day. This is very poor business practice and would never think about booking with them ever. I can see this if you cancel at the last minute. Don''t book here.,May 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,530,90
