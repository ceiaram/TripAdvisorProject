It is a motel, not a hotel so this seems like highly false advertising. It was nice to have a small fridge and microwave and both worked just fine.

Two weeks ago, we drove up on Saturday morning and decided it wouldn't hurt to ask if we could check in early--they let us check in at 10 am and were very friendly about it, going out of their way to make us happy.  They have the typical free breakfast in the morning (cereal, pastries, MAKE-YOUR-OWN WAFFLES!!!, and alas, crappy coffee) and on our last stay, they had sausage patties and scrambled eggs too that weren't too bad.  There is a decent sized pool and jacuzzi spa, but we've never used either since most of our time in that area is spent near the beach at Newport.

Was given a room facing the parking lot even though requested to be on the other side of the building.  Cars were coming and going all night in the parking lot.  Loud yelling and slamming of doors. Young guys sitting in their parked cars. Definitely something dangerous going on there. Would have been terrified if just a single person staying there or if I was a woman with a child.
