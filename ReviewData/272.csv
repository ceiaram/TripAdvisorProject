This place is awesome!  It's completely renovated and everything is so nice!!  The beds were ""new stiff"" but very comfortable (if that makes sense)  I liked that there was a separate sink and mirror area for us to get ready in that wasn't connected to the shower and toilet.  Not all rooms come with a fridge, so if you need one, be sure to book that room.  We usually travel with a cooler, so it's not a huge deal for us. The room was a nice size for a traveling couple, and the area is really quite. They have a huge parking lot that's well lit and the area feels safe.  We actually used the pool and that was nice too.

All of the wall sockets were loose I can only charge my stuff in the bathroom. 2 days I couldn’t get fresh new towels because there wasn’t house keeping and the front desk women didn’t do anything.  There is a hot grab and go breakfast but really it’s old cold danish and cheap granola bar in paper bag and doesn’t include drinks.

Even after establishing that he was a paying guest there, the manager would not allow him to leave and threatened him with the police if he did.  He told him that he looked lowly and what was he doing out at night.  Perhaps the hotel should be in a better neighborhood if you have such a problem with people at night.  Treating one of your guests in such a manner is unacceptable.  Also, asked for an extra towel and was told that we could come down to the office and get one.

It is not walking distance to Disneyland, but the Anaheim Resort Transit stop is right outside the hotel and runs every 30 minutes starting at 7:20 am and ends after Disneyland closes.  I believe the line that runs from this hotel to DL is 10 or 11;  the stop drops you off right in front of DL and each line for the ART has it's own well marked stop at the DL entrance which was helpful after leaving the park late in the evening.  The ART fee was $5 per day per person and a good value in my opinion and sold at the front desk.   Didn't use the pool, but it is very small. The continental breakfast was pretty simple but free.
