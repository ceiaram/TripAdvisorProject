We are familiar with the rates because we stayed there  2 times before.  I never been helped by this lady before there was an older lady and gentlemen they were kind people this horrible lady though killed the quality of this place.  She yelled and gave me attitude for no reason. I never disrespected her or gave her any sort of attitude  having no rooms available  she replied ""So What""  rolled her eyes and walked away from the desk. How Sad for her .. I'm never returning and I advise anyone not to stay there ,In case she tries to Scam You as well.",October 2015,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,488
