We had to remove the knob from one, take it into the other room, and put it on the other A/C if we wanted to adjust it.  Not well maintained at all.  The top of the bedding was turned down, and I could not believe how wrinkled the top sheet was!  Not what I'd expect from a Best Western.  They should've been embarrassed to make a bed like that.  Then we found ants in the bathroom.  On the floor, in the tub,",July 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,44,386

Especially when traveling it's great to have laundry facility! The breakfast was amazing. European style and continental breakfast. Loved the pool to relax. Great location for traveling in orange county. Very close to yorba linda park",May 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,45,386
13 helpful votes,34 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Not A Very Good Best Western,"I booked this hotel through Priceline. It ws supposed to be a 2 1/2 star hotel but wasn't. When I found out that Priceline booked me at a Best Western I was pleased. I've stayed at a few in the past and was happy with them. This property is not deserving of the Best Western name.  I'm smiling as I read the reviews left by others because I've experienced many of the same thngs as other's did. They saved me the time of writing of writing the same review.  By the way, the web site said they had high speed internet. They do bu only a few rooms can pick up the wireless signal. I was lucky enough to pick up the signal from Keno's restaurant across the parking lot!",February 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,46,386

Instead, I found nothing major to complain about.  I checked in for a New Years' stay and anticipated beat up rooms and hallways and lots of noise.  What I got was much nicer.  There is plenty of free parking close to your room.  I perceived no unusual odors in the hallways at all...they are exposed to the outside so any aromas probably wafted in from the neighborhood!  My room was clean and in good repair.  There was one stain on the carpet (appeared to be from a beverage spilled some time ago) but no other problems.  The bed was very, very comfortable; I slept like a baby all four nights!  The only downsides were a strange choice of channels on the TV: Three HBOs, two ESPNs but no",December 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,47,386
12 helpful votes,6 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Wished we had stayed elsewhere...,"We booked this motel because family members who lived nearby thought it would be a convenient location in relation to their place as well as all the theme parks.  They were right about it being fairly convenient to their place, and I see in other posts that people had mentioned the close proximity to the freeway, shopping centre and nearby restaurants.  HOWEVER - this motel is one that I would never recommend to anyone.  The passageways are dark and smelled of something I never could quite put my finger on, possibly a cross between mold and urine??  The pool was not clean, not even my completely easy going two year old would venture into it.  The room itself was a good size, but I would hope so as it was a 'suite'.  The second bed in the room (sofabed) was not made nor was there",April 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,48,386

The room was large enough that even with 2 crates getting around was easy even for 2 women in 1 room. There is just about any type of food restaurants within just a couple blocks of the hotel and plenty of grass areas for the dogs (remember to pick up after yourself, so they don't mind us coming back). And if you forgot something there is a shopping center right across the street. Room was clean, and generally in good repair. I do wish they allowed the continental breakfast to be taken back to the room. Would definately stay again.",March 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,50,386

We were in town for a wedding and we needed something close so we could sleep, instead of driving home.  It's a very dated, dark hotel, not much to look at, although the reception makes it look grand.  This hotel has a lot of potential, but right now it's slightly below average. The hotel room we stayed in way big and it faced the freeway. It wasn't too clean, and the sheets and pillows were dirty.

11 helpful votes,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,We do not recommend this Best Western,"This Best Western was substandard, at best.  When we arrived it looked as though there were only a few people checked in, but it seemed we were given the worse room they had. It was on at the back end of the complex, on a corner where a lot of people moved through. There was an ironing board in the room, but no iron. When I ask for one at the front desk, (the phone did not work), the girl said that housekeeping wasn't there at that hour and I could get one in the morning after the time we planned to leave for the day. There wasn’t an apology for the phone not working and no offer to make it right. They advertise a Continental Breakfast, but didn't tell us where to find it or what time it was.
