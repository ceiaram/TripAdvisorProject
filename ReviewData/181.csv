A mixed drink runs about $18. I opted just to have one of their teas made into iced tea which was OK but not so great for nine dollars. Others with me had more elaborate choices and enjoyed their drinks. We also had water for the hour or two that we were there.

We were between montage and the Ritz and we are so happy we went with the montage. We went to the Ritz for drinks and it looks dated and not as close to the beach as the montage. The only hiccup we had was during the Holiday Tea service. I checked in with concierge the day of and she indicated that they ""were fully committed"" she did not even offer to check or see if there was any way I understood that they needed a headcount and things were premade but she showed a lack of effort.

To begin, the resort is set on a bluff overlooking the Pacific - the views are outstanding from the resorts lobby as well as from our Bungalow two bedroom suite.  Although the rooms were the most expensive that we've ever stayed in, luxury was in abundance.  The furnishings were beautiful, the bathrooms were incredibly luxurious in heavy marble and beautiful fixtures and appointments, and the beds were out of this world - feather top mattresses with 400 thread count",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2069,181

Terrific location, lovely rooms, great dining room. Room service food was mediocre at best. Pool staff was charming and efficient, concierge staff was spotty at best. Wake up calls were missed..... I am lazy...so inasmuch as the Montage is lovely, the service at the Ritz prevails.

1 helpful vote,4 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Perfect Resort,"The resort is outstanding and the location cannot be beat! This is the place to stay in Laguna Beach and is the best hotel in Orange County. The St. Regis ranks 2nd to the Montage because the Montage is located in the perfect spot. This is a 5 star resort and do not rely on anything that rates it lower. The Rooms have a view to die for (pay for the view, it is worth it), The rooms all face the ocean side so there is no bad side to the hotel. Some rooms look at other building and have partial ocean views but that comes with the lower price tag. The spa does cost an extra $20 to use if you are not having a treatment, but that has become the future of 5 star hotel (drop that and this place is perfect). The rooms are 500s.f. which is a great size and the patio or terrace is a nice",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2072,181
6 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dissappointed,I have been traveling to Laguna Beach every year for the past two decades.  We have stayed at various places throughout the city but never had the dissappointment of this trip.    The Hotel neighbors Aliso Creek which apparently is the sewer outlet for several inland cities.  We learned this because it would begin to smell like feces in our room in the evenings as it wafted our way from the creek.   Residents in the surounding neighborhood are obviously unhappy with the Resort and they're snearing hostility is unpleasant to encounter.   When walking on the beach I noticed several homeless people sleeping about which made me nervous to walk around the grounds without an escort.    I wouldn't stay there again,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2073,181
39 helpful votes,8 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A beautiful property with a luxury spa and lots of service!,"My spouse and I just returned from a brief stay at the Montage Resort.  We were impressed!  We went in low season, but the resort was fully staffed - so many staff member in fact, it felt like they vastly outnumbered us guests.  When booking, call the resort for special deals and offers, especially if you're going in low season.  The resort overlooks a spectacular ocean bluff, with access to a clean, quiet beach (with tide pools) in artsy Laguna Beach.  Service was excellent all-around.  Before our nightly turndown service, we tipped the housekeeper a bit more than usual, and in turn we received many extra bath supplies and towels!  No ""attitude"" at all from the staff and management of Montage during our entire stay.  Our room was of the least expensive option (Ocean Horizon),",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2074,181

The room was well appointed and the room was breathtaking.  We had a full ocean view and could hear the sounds of the ocean from our room.  From the moment we drove up to the lobby the service was impeccable.  Although our stay was short, the staff was soon addressing us by name and constantly thanking us for our patronage.  All housekeeping requests were answered promptly and correctly.  I really don't understand the mediocre and poor reviews.  Perhaps standards are too high?

The Montage all though very expensive has everything one could ever want in a hotel. The views, the rooms, the amenites are as good as it gets when you are afterall away from home. The staff of the entire resort exude courtesy and offer you anything within the power they are given. It is a truly remarkable hotel and rates in my book with the Belagio Villas.

You expect to pay for a hotel that has gone to such great lengths to preserve the view and provide such luxury. This  hotel has certainly made sure of that. It’s very expensive, more so than other resorts of the same caliber. All of this is fine if you know what to really  expect. If you’re getting away for a quite romantic weekend, be prepared.  Everything about the resort is geared toward being outside which means   it is a popular destination for meetings, outdoor banquets, tours, weddings, children and generally lots of people sharing the same space.

Nice Lobby, nice views, lovely grounds.  But.....  if you are trying to get to your bungalow or room at the end of a wing it is a hassel.  The hallways zigzag and we had to take two different elevators to get to our room.   The rooms are ok, but the shower and tub only fits one.  Be sure to call at least 4 days in advance or sweet talk the concierge to getting you a table at their Studio restaurant for dinner.  The food is average and expense for what is served.  I don't mind shelling out some extra dough for something that is tasty, but the food was bland.   There is a nice trail down to the beach, but don't expect towel or umbrella service like St. Regis.

We had a one bedroom ocean bungalow (snuck a peek at the price, 1,800 a day) and it was magnificent!  The staff had anticipated our important stay and we had a bottle of Cristal champagne perched on our beautiful bed upon arrival and a gift basket of special beach goodies for me!  We had a long relaxing week there at the Montage and it was simply the most relaxing vacay I have ever had!  The staff was so fun and kind and attentive!  They were very young yes, but very nice and somehow very experienced!  I felt comfortable with them being younger though, because I am younger myself.
