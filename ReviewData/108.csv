Yes it was during the heavy LA rain but it still really worked out.  Wifi is pretty good at the hotel but I wouldn't recommend it for zoom or Teams video calls, it was a bit more spotty then. Location is fantastic, easy access to the walking paths and beaches. About a 10-15 minute walk downtown and right by some of the free trolley stops too. And about a 4 minute walk to the grocery store.  Bed is incredibly comfortable, shower is small, bathroom is very small. I also didn't have hot water while there which...isn't great in January, even in California. That is the only thing that would really keep me from going back.

To answer your question, the reviews posted on TripAdvisor are from verified guests that have stayed with us, the same way you wrote your review.  You booked your room last minute on a very busy Martin Luther King Jr. weekend where most hotels in Laguna Beach offered rates of at least $200+ for that Saturday night. The phone app you used offers competitive non-refundable rates, however, the catch is that you do not get to choose your room type. We gave you the bigger of the two rooms we had available at the time. We're not sure what you were expecting as our website, along with other 3rd party websites, provide pictures of our property and guest rooms.  Our property has exterior corridors and we are located on Pacific Coast Highway. We wish we could control the road noise more, but it is out of our control. We do offer double pane windows and complimentary ear plugs in all guests rooms for sensitive sleepers. We're happy to offer individual air conditioning/heating in our guest rooms as some beach properties do not have them.  We appreciate and are grateful for all of our guests and are always more than happy to answer any questions the best we could prior to you making a reservation to see if we would be the best fit for your accommodation needs in Laguna Beach.  The Tides offers old Laguna charm that is affordable and clean and while we understand everyone has their own preferences, we sincerely apologize for not meeting your expectations and sad that you could not enjoy the conveniences our property offers. One of the things our guests love is that we are right across the street from beautiful Heisler Park and only a short walk to downtown Laguna Beach where you can find shops, restaurants and art galleries among other things.

We do not provide any sort of hot breakfast here but do have fresh fruit in the office as we like our guests to go out and enjoy beautiful Laguna Beach and the wonderful restaurants nearby. We will definitely keep your suggestion in mind, however, when making future improvements/changes.

The location is spectacular, it's a 3 min walk to the nearest beach at Heisler Park, which is a lovely park and within it lies a pathway to a very pretty beach with plenty of lounging space. It's also walking distance to several cafes including Urthe, and a five minute walk to Whole Foods.

While not ideal as a business hotel, it's perfect for a weekend getaway. The location is great, being only minutes from the oceanside parks and beaches. The staff are very nice and helpful - when I checked in, they suggested I move to another room because it's quieter. The Tides is clean, comfortable and has a good boutique feel to it.   Since it's on the PCH, there can be significant road noise for the rooms close to the road. The hotel provides earplugs.   I had room 213 which has two double beds, a fire place and faces the back alley making it the quietest room.  The only downside is there can be room noise through the adjoining doors between rooms.

Given the price of our room, we could not have been happier and more pleased staying at The Tides Inn. Our room with king-sized bed was very comfortable and ""homey"". The bed linens and other attention to detail are superb, and we did not feel like we were staying in a motel/hotell but rather a friend's guest room. No disgusting polyester bedspread like hotel chains!! Our room was immaculate. And since we were traveling with our 6-year old daughter, it was nice having a kitchenette for snacks and juices. Tides Inn is within easy walking",April 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,602,108

We're a young married couple, who was looking for a night getaway, but we didn't want to spend a lot of money. The Tides Inn was the perfect place. The front of the renovated inn can be deceiving that you will just have the typical motel experience. BUT, that is the oposite of what lies behind the concrete wall. What lies behind is a charming, afforadle getaway. The rooms are individually decorated, all with charm and warmth. Our room was large with a kitchenette, and decent size bathroom. Each peice in the room seems to reflect the personal tastes of the owners. And it looks as if they are continuing to improve the outside look as well, with great landscaping. This is a great place to stay for just a night or for a week. Have Fun!",April 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,603,108

It's a small motel, right on the road...so you definitely hear the traffic in the morning.  The rooms have been ""renovated,""  so they are actually quite nicely decorated.  There is even a small ""kitchenette""...with microwave and small refrigerator.  But small things are missing....such as only one small mirror in the whole room (in the bathroom), and no clock next to the bed.  And I wish I could say the bed was more comfortable...but it wasn't. The last thing....the pool area was closed....due to resurfacing. It would have been nice if we were told that.  I'm sure it will be nice for summer.

Where on the Southern California coast can you find a great price, great hospitality and great ambience all in one neat package. Linda and Dale are born to be hoteliers. The rooms are immaculate, cozy and warm (the beds are awesome). A nice small kitchen with micro, fridge and sink and dishes in our room allowed us to go to the local market steps away to get breakfast and lunch. On the ocean front across the street and a few blocks down is the famous Las Brisas restaurant. A margarita at Las Brisas at sunset will take your breath away.

Every room is different. The room I stayed in was huge and had hardwood floors, a beamed ceiling, a large kitchenette, antique furnishings, windows that open, and a VERY COMFORTABLE bed with a duvet. Felt like a bed & breakfast, and very homelike (but no breakfast is served since you have a kitchen).   Bathroom was small (and only had a stall shower), and walls are very thin (quiet when neighbors were not talking)...also room had a funny smell at first. Could use some more ""finishing touches"" in the room: some of the furniture looked worn (but that goes with the territory of antiques), and the closet could use a new coat of paint.But other than that you can't beat this",February 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,607,108

The front desk were really helpful with restaurant recommendations and places to photograph. Our room was large with a kitchen area. The decor is more modern than your average motel and it is very clean. However the bathroom was tiny. Literally not enough room for 2 people to be in there unless one was in the shower!

The only Tide one may possibly see is detergent. We stayed here and had one major dissapointment after another, from a dingy room with paper thin walls and black hair on the sheets to the funky location not near anything but the noise of the highway. I find it odd that several of the reviews here have the same headline..... Hmmm makes one wonder. Well, I was fooled, don't you be. If you are looking for a cheap road side rest, go for it, if your looking for a vacation retreat look elsewhere.

However, knowing before we checked in that this was a renovated ""motel"", our ""cons"" are realistic:  stained carpets; extremely small, hard-to-navigate parking lot; lack of privacy when sitting on the ""terrace"".

Then they called us several times urging to get it back asap - we had hardly time to use it. What about buying one extra?? Found the place overpriced compared to what you get. Pool was out of work the whole stay. Laguna Beach is a very nice place, you can walk everywhere, the beaches are beautiful and there are many nice restaurants.
