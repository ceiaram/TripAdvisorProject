152 helpful votes,122 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice renovated place but not great.  I'd stay here again.,"As others have stated, this is an old 2 story motel that has had a major renovation.  At first glance, the renovation is very impressive inside and out, rooms are large, bedding comfortable, HVAC works well (whereas many hotels in the area have working AC and about half the time the heat does not work at all), rooms are quiet.  Showers (no tub) are the rainfall type in a new tile enclosure.  The neighborhood is mixed; businesses, new homes, older homes.  There are several restaurants and a convenience store within a safe 5 minute walk.  Although the address is Costa Mesa, it is on the border of downtown Newport Beach.  Getting to Newport or Huntington beaches is a short drive.  It is adjacent to a major highway, Rt 55, but you can’t hear traffic in the rooms and the closeness",September 2022,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,439

Motel solo superficialmente ristrutturato, con arredi e infissi e porte  da rifare. Pulizia accettabile. Peccato che su 4 giorni per ben 2 volte di siano dimenticati di rifare la nostra camera, provvedendo solo alle 6 di sera al nostro rientro, su nostra lamentela. Asciugamani scadenti e con un brutto odore . Piscina sporca, priva di manutenzione. Viene offerta una colazione, fatta solo di prodotti scadenti confezionati, senza nessuno del personale che si occupi dj rifornire i vassoi e soprattutto di ma tenere in ordine la saletta minuscola , con vista sul cortile usato come discarica . A parità di prezzo, sicuramente meglio affidarSi a catene alberghiere consolidate .",August 2022,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,439

We needed somewhere near to Newport as we had the Catalina Flyer booked.  The hotel was above and beyond our expectations.  Extremely clean, updated rooms, beautiful bathrooms, massive television, great on the go breakfast, microwave, fridge, free speciality hot drinks always available in the reception.  The room was very spacious and very well thought out.  Best of all, the reception we received was very welcoming, the best we’ve had in the nearly 3 weeks we’ve been touring California.  Thank you so much for an awesome stay x",June 2022,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,439

The rooms smell and look great and best part zero bugs found. Love the enthusiasm of the front desk team to help. I would definitely suggest this for families visiting and looking for a clean, safe and affordable accommodation.",March 2022,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,439

Easy breezy, nothing fancy but remarkably clean and the front desk was super welcoming and informative. Couple convenience stores and gas stations nearby which are always good to have. Also the neighborhood is very quiet. Got a good night's sleep.",September 2021,none,none,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,439
