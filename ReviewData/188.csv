Cons: Weird hotel layout(kinda felt like going through a maze), uncomfortable bed (sinks in the middle), wifi password didn't work.  This was a quaint and cozy little hotel that we spent one night in. I was worried at first that noise would be an issue since we saw a very large, young crowd of people going into the room next to us. Didn't hear a thing unless they were outside the room. Seemingly good insulation in the rooms. Our room was located right next to the ice maker, vending  machine and a storage area for the cleaning people.

I will say I had never experienced the breakfast room practice of getting bakery items (bagels, muffins, toast, packaged pancakes) from the kitchen worker and waiting for her to toast/microwave them.

158 helpful votes,60 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,So close to being freat,"Our family of 5 stayed in a suite for 2 nights in mid November.  The hotel was quite quiet with few other rooms occupied.  With a little work this hotel could be quite a gem.  The courtyard was very nice and the hotel is in a great location.  The breakfast was above average for a continental breakfast, with helpful staff working it.  The suite was roomy with 2 queens in one room and a TV.  The hide a bed in the front room was very uncomfortable, we ended up taking the mattress off the bed and placing it on the floor (which helped only a little).  Some of the sheets had blood stains, and when we asked for blankets for the hide a bed were given 2 tiny torn single blankets.  Our other complaint was that housekeeping did not replace used items (coffee, shampoos etc).  We did not get",November 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,661,188
4 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Best for the money,"We have stayed at the Casablanca Inn many times when visiting relatives in San Clemente. The experience this time was superior. We had one of the new rooms on the first floor, adjacent to the pool and convenient to the parking lot, breakfast room and, even the ice machine. From what I understand, the entire property has been updated along with the addition of these new rooms. Now, there is ample parking which sometimes was a problem.   Having a pool is a real plus after an afternoon at the beach. North Beach, one of our favorites, is actually within walking distance, but offers plenty of parking, a lifeguard and a snack grill.   Although meager, the breakfast has been upgraded. If you want something more substantial, there is a nice place just across El Camino Real.

42 helpful votes,26 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Its okay,"Stayed for one night Monday, June 19, 2006; 2 adults/ 2 children ages 4&6 years old.  Thomas at the front desk check-in is wonderful.  Energetic, friendly and informative.    The room - large but no big thrills.  Basic room.  All rooms face a courtyard with a fountain which drowns out the street traffic.  There is nothing in walking distance for food that 2 young kids could eat.  But can walk to the beach.  7-11 store down the road.  Continental breakfast is served in the courtyard - which may have been appealing but it was a dreary misty morning and you did not want to linger.  Meager food selection.  Went away hungry.    Not the beach type area hotel I thought it was going to be.  Thought it would be more laid back since it wasn't in the L.A. city limits.

7 helpful votes,7 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Secret Local Hideaway,"Upon reading the few reviews on this hotel, I decided to finally give it a shot.  My family and I stayed there from July 2-4.  At first we encountered some check-in problems, however, thanks to the hotel manager Thomas, that was very quickly resolved.  Staying at the new wing was wonderful!  It was quiet and pretty well appointed with a separate sink, microwave and food preparation area.  The hotel itself is a 5 minute walk to the beach.  Right before you hit the beach is a 7 Eleven where my 8 year old got her ICEE's. The beach itself is a bit on the rocky side and is not as nice as Hermosa or Manhattan, however, the water was pleasant enough, but watch out for those big waves!

The room was nice and spacious and very clean we had no problems. Lovely shower. There was some noise from the room next door, dont know if we could hear them more because there was an adjoining door to their room, but  they were just excited children who soon calmed down!!   We didnt use any facilities, breakfast looked  nice and there was a pool and spa area.  Its a great location, easy to find and close to the beach. Although the weather was not good when we were there we still mangaged to stroll along the pier and the beach and then browse the shops on the way back.

323 helpful votes,286 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Decent place to stay,"We stayed at the Casablanca on September 19, 2005.  Ours was a standard motel room--nothing fancy.  It was reasonably clean and a large enough room.  We appreciated having a sink area separate from the bathroom/shower.  There was plenty of counter space at the sink.  We had lots of hot water and a very good adjustable shower head.  However, there was mold growing on the ceiling above the shower.  The room had a microwave and a mini-refrigerator.  All night long I heard the fridge turning off and turning on.  Our beds were quite hard, but friends of ours who were staying in another room said their beds were too soft.  The beach is just a couple blocks away, and we had an enjoyable walk there in the morning.  I was disappointed in the continental breakfast.

At first, you might think it's in an odd location, but it's very quiet, close to the beach and easy access to the freeway.  No view, but a safe location.
