Front Desk:  They provided us a room about two hours before their official check-in time of 4 pm.  We had booked through a third party (Hotwire).  At other hotels, this seems to be a problem.  But, at this hotel, this didn't seem to have any negative effect at all.  We were given a terrific room.  Restaurant:  We ate at the restuarant two of the three nights.

We choose the hotel because they offered a package on reduced tickets to the Knotts Berry Amusement park and was close by.  First, the hotel is on the older side as others have written, perhaps similar to a hotel from the 1990's early 2000.   The rooms are functional but are dated.  Our room faced the splash pad/pool and at 11pm I could hear the people from the pool (i was in 5th floor) and windows were closed....so as others have written, thin walls.

Downside is that you do have to pay to park (it was $9, which isn't too bad compared to what some hotels charge), but there was plenty of it while we were there and I think that's much cheaper than the park's lot.",October 2018,none,none,"Hello 111kristens,  We’re thrilled you enjoyed our convenient proximity to Knott's Berry Farm, we love making our guests happy at Knott’s Berry Farm Hotel.

The hotel is literally around the corner from Knott's Berry Farm park, a very easy stroll through the marketplace.  The pool area is large, includes a kid's splash area, and stays open until 11pm.  And you can get a glimpse of the Disneyland fireworks from the upper floors. The rooms are in desperate need of updates.  You can feel and hear every single spring in the mattress, pillows were lumpy, and the curtains had holes.  The park is so close you can hear the screamers on the roller coasters, so pack ear plugs!

The bathroom was adequately clean. The shower could’ve used a little more scrubbing but it wasn’t disgusting or anything like that.

I debated if it was worth upgrading to the Snoopy room considering my kids are 9 and 11. But my kids absolutely loved the Snoopy touch and were so excited that Snoopy tucked them into bed every night. It was worth the extra money. The rooms could use some updating but they are kept clean and are in decent condition. The room we stayed in faces a wall so there was absolutely no view. But the hotel is very creative in putting some cute Snoopy cutouts on the wall so we barely noticed there was no view. The staff was great, restaurant was great and park was fun.

The closet door was broken and maintenance had to come repair it as soon as we got there. Also, the air conditioning unit let off a funny smell that reminded me of Raid.

As you stated, we take great pride in our ability to correct the minor frustrations that guests may have from the undeniable age of our property. With that being said we are also committed to preventative maintenance plans that help update our rooms to maintain a fresh and clean feeling throughout the property. There are several areas that we hope to make large strides in as it related to ‘value added’ features in our pool and activities areas however you were accurate about the rate sensitivity; if we provide upgrades all at once our rates would be affected whereas a gradual development of our property results in little to no rate growth which is our goal within this market. With that being said, AC issues are unacceptable and should be noted by housekeeping and corrected by maintenance prior to guest arrival.

I greatly appreciate the effort and detail in your review because it allows us in management the opportunity to identify failure points so that we can improve in the future. Addressing your first concern, those gentlemen should not have been hanging around the desk while off the clock because of the perception that it creates to families like yours. We do have bell services until approximately 11pm or 12am nightly depending on our shuttle transportation schedule however the delivery of that message should have been better. The only way the pool would ever be closed during their normal operational hours would be if there was a sanitary concern such as a child who had an accident. These things unfortunately do happen when you have the volume of children who stay with us and our procedure is extremely ridged in how we handle these incidents for the safety of our guests.

I am very sorry to learn of your negative experience and subsequent perception of our property. While we are an older building we do our best to maintain it through a weekly preventative maintenance program that is designed to limit the occurrence of the very experience that you had with us. Clearly that room was in need at the time of your stay however I am not able to locate neither that stain nor the odor so I am confident that the problems have been resolved. The comment surrounding the occupancy may be based on the room type.  It is very possible that while the total percentage was lower than an actual sell out the inability to move your room may have been due to the sell-out of that specific room type.  Without the exact dates it is tough to say for sure but it is hard to believe that we would be lying to our guests so I have to imagine a more likely explanation.

Other than the room, there are many things that I loved about the hotel. We got there really early but my little son was ill.

We did have to pay $5 a night for parking and my in-laws had to pay $7 a night - I think the rate you have to pay for parking depends on how large your room is or how many beds you have or something.

I wanted to briefly touch on a few things you mentioned so that you and any potential guests are aware for the future. The parking rates should only fluctuate relative to the way the reservation was booked and since you both used Hotwire I am not sure why they were different. The room size, however, I can explain as what the industry refers to as ‘run of the house’ room availability. When using a bidding site like Hotwire or Priceline we are often able to offer our guests a heavily discounted rate under the knowledge that they will be given any available room type that can accommodate the number of registered guests. The employee interaction about the bell cart is very odd but no employee should be rude, whether it to be a guest or a fellow employee so I certainly apologize for behavior.

I can agree that the Single Queen Room option is on the smaller side, as advertised, but normally at much discounted rates these rooms are designed to give families a more economic option when planning a visit to our hotel. With that being said, staying anywhere in our area over a Holiday weekend will definitely result in a higher cost so I can see where the value seemed lacking. I am sorry to learn about the poor Wi-Fi connection and negative experience in our pool area.

Having done our research we knew that parking would be $4 per day as was the refrigerator, so no issues what so ever there. A cheap alternative is to buy a polystryene cool box from Walmart and top up with ice - ours cost $5 and held at least 12-16 bottles/cans. Also good for taking pool side. When you take into consideration the fantastic discounts you can get for Knottsberry & Soak city, this hotel represents great value for money. The 4 of us saved close to $120 off the entry prices.

There are very few of this room type available at our property and they are designed to give a significantly discounted option for those guests who do not plan to be in their room to often. While this design does allow for guests to stay at our property who otherwise would not be able to it also can create a frustration for those guests like yourself who find themselves there only due to a sellout of the larger options. We are very careful to ensure that the balconies that you speak of are not advertised anywhere as being for guest use as they are only there to provide a safety resource for the engineers who conduct maintenance on the AC units in the rooms.

While this experience is clearly not up to your and our standards it is extremely helpful for us as we work towards our goals of increased guest satisfaction. I am unaware of any ‘makeshift wetbars’ in our rooms but I will certainly address the quality of the products being used when designing these add-ons to be sure they are projecting a higher quality. The odor you experienced was unfortunately found to be an area wide sewer issue that has since been corrected so I assure you that you will not experience anything like this in the future. The issues with the television and refrigerator are both unacceptable and extremely uncommon as both of those amenities are inspected daily to ensure the highest quality.

I ended up booking a 1 queen bed small room for my boyfriend and I. Staff was very friendly and helpful and I ended up booking the 'classic' package which included a breakfast buffet ($14/ person value) plus tickets to the farm and parking fees. We were up early (breakfast buffet starts as early as 6:30) and we were the first to enter the theme park (opened at 10:00am on the Wed. ). We did all the rides in under 2 hours. There were no lines and the rides themselves were just enough thrill to make it memorable. I especially liked the wooden roller coaster one.

In further researching your reservation after our conversation I see that you arrived over two hours prior to our guarenteed check-in time which may have been the cause of your delayed check-in and wait for the complimentary Snoopy toys. In that conversation I remember explaining the Snoopy character visit is contracted from the theme park and unfortunately not flexible should you miss the scheduled visit included into your package. I am not sure why the character’s escort would not have informed you on this when you saw them in the hallway the morning of your departure but I will certainly discuss it with that team to ensure it more property communicated in the future. The issue you experienced with the air conditioner is, however, something that my team and I should have caught prior to your arrival and for this I do apologize. As I mentioned in our telephone conversation I would like you and your family to return so that you can have the positive experience that keep many of our guests returning year after year. If you change your mind and would like to discuss this or any potential future bookings please contact me directly and I would be happy to assist in any way possible.

The Snoopy room, tickets to Knott's Berry Farm, vouchers for the breakfast buffet for everyone in the party and of course a visit from Snoopy at bedtime all for under $350.  Parking is free, the room is comfortable and clean and the employees are pleasant and helpful.

Once I had checked in I was then able to join them in the room where my wife had started to unpack. We then discovered a condom wrapper by the wash basin.

The pool was great, clean and tidy, the toy is good fun and there is a really hot jacuzzi which is open with the pool till 11pm.  There were also guest laundry facilities quite handy, a mini arcade, a cash machine (ATM) and gift shop.
