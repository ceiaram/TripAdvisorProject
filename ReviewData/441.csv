2 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Anniversary trip,"Planned a last minute trip to Laguna beach with my wife the night of thanksgiving. My wife managed to find the Laguna beach inn and she called the front desk to book a little getaway. She was helped by a man by the name of Greg. Greg was eager to help us. He managed to book us over the phone and was very helpful with everything during our entire stay. He helped with a very late check in, told us all of the hot spots there are to see in Laguna beach. The room was cute/cozy and we had a lovely view of the beach to wake up to. Room had cable, a/c, fast wifi and cleanliness. Overall, because of the attentiveness and hospitality of Greg, my wife and would definitely come back.",November 2020,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,441

The rooms are clean but feel a tad run down and dated. It smelled a bit musty and the bed was overly firm and not comfortable. My husband and I felt each others' every movement. The extra resort fee seems rather ridiculous when all you get for it is wifi and access to a tiny pool. Still, it's a fine motel stay if you need to be in Laguna city limits on a budget.",October 2020,Second floor toward the middle of the building is probably your best bet for lower noise levels.,none,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,3,441

We chose the hotel because it was along the main drag albeit further down, close to Wood's Cove and had individual AC units which we like to think are a bit safer in light of COVID.  On our drive down from Santa Barbara, about 5pm of the day of our reservation, we received a call from the hotel. They informed us they had no available room due to construction, and our credit card would not be charged. We were surprised as I had  booked the hotel some time ago using a reputable site.  They said they would try to find a comparable place for us. We then began calling various places to see what we could find ourselves. About an hour later, while we were still driving, the motel called back and said there",October 2020,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,441
4 helpful votes,5 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Anniversary Trip.,Stayed here with my husband two years ago for our 6th anniversary. Originally had reservations at Capri at Laguna that were LOST. This hotel was half the price. Staff was friendly and the beach was super close! Needs a little TLC but aside from that i would stay again!!,October 2019,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,441
