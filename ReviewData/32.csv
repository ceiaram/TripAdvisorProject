The location is great, the suites are large, and the staff is professional and friendly.  The only negative for us was the breakfast:  bagel, cream cheese, yogurt, boiled eggs, and juice.  Unfortunately, this meal was served every day that we visited, and I seriously considered deducting a star for this reason.  It is my sincere hope that management at this hotel will improve this area.  Families, such as myself, have come to depend on a decent, filling breakfast from the hotel chains that we know and trust and more effort could be focused in this important area.  There are many choices, such as pre-packaged breakfast sandwiches or cereals and milk that could be provided.

Had two queen sized beds and a pull out couch.   Plenty of extra space for the kids to run around.  Best part was the toy story shuttle to Disneyland was a two minute walk.   They also included a continental breakfast.  Huge plus for my son who always wakes up hungry.  Previous hotels we always had to find something near by, but usually a drive.

Stay in the kids’ suite which has a sliding door and bunk beds as well as a hidabed for the kiddos. Enjoy peace and quiet in your king bed. The pool is amazing and everything feels very fresh, new and clean! Cons: breakfast during Covid is a huge disappointment. No buffet, just a sad, cold take home box of disastrous proportions. Towels were never plentiful at the pool. Always calling to ask to restock. Just grab some from the maid on the way to the pool.

We went to Disney every day during our stay. Walking from the hotel to the park took 20 - 25 minutes. The walk was not bad and is doable (if you are up for it). At night the further you get from the parks the eerier it got. Not so much I felt unsafe just that had to be cautious. There was some homeless, and interesting people out let's just say that. Uber/lyft cost about $6-7 depending what time you take one (could be less during times that arent busy such as after park opens and before park close).

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Hotel and New!,Pretty much a newly built hotel! Modern! My hotel stay began before my arrival. The previous night I have called to see if there is any possible way I could get an early check in. The front desk representative named Ivan was very understanding and accommodating. He was able to give us early check in for the day of arrival. The room given to us was a pretty clean room except for some hair that were found randomly. The only things that I could be picky about was the noise from the road and the air conditioner. It didn’t bother us too much so we just let it slide. The stay was great overall with excellent Customer Service from Ivan and Antonio that assisted us with late checkout. If you are going to Disneyland it is a good hotel to stay at!

It was very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable.   I love the bright white bedding which made me feel that the room was sterile and clean.  The laminate floors were a plus since I'm always wary of rugs and carpets and wear flip flops so my bare feet never touch the rugs.   The TV was new and huge.  The cable service provider Spectrum was slow and lagged when changing channels so that was annoying.  I don't believe that is the fault of hotel but they should be aware.  The breakfast was good and fresh.  Scrambled eggs,  chorizo, waffles and your typical continent choices were fresh and fully stocked.

Its clean, new and the standard Hampton Inn services etc.  The breakfast was good and offerings varied daily (we stayed as a family for 6 nights while on a Disneyland vacation).  Our stay was largely enjoyable.  The only negatives that held back my review is the automatic lighting in the rooms is can be extremely aggravating to deal with. It was impossible to read at night without the lights going off every 5 minutes.  We asked the front desk if this could be adjusted and they said it could be (they wrote it down for maintenance) but it was never done. So on such a long stay this was frustrating.
