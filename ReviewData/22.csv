Pros- the room was spacious (deluxe queen). The room had a second door that lead to the pool. The chairs are nice, and I prefer the comfy chairs over sitting on the bed. The Disney shuttle is great, especially after a long day at the park. In the morning there was a duck in the pool - yes this is a pro because it's funny. They have very nice grounds with fountains and ponds. Cons- there were french fries on the floor of our room when we checked in so there's no way the floor could have been vacuumed. The beds were awful. They appeared to be at least 30 years old.  The bathroom is tiny and was in dire need of a complete remodel. There's a fridge but no microwave.

I realize that there is a demand for hotels/rooms with castle or Disney-like themes.  Our room had dark brocade curtains and other design choices of this nature - and was not to my taste.

The hotel is outdated, everything was dirty, the bathroom was gross with mold on the walls and a shower that drained so slow we were up to our ankles in water.

The main objective of our stay was only for the purpose of Disneyland. We spent most of our days out in the park and came back to the room for a shower and sleep.   The hotel is surrounded by the freeway so there aren’t any shops or places to eat apart from those onsite.   The shuttle bus was the biggest positive. Due to the location of the hotel it’s too far too walk and only a small 5 min ride to Disneyland. The shuttle to the park every 30 mins was a big help. I would recommend going out to line up for the shuttle 10 mins prior to departure at peak periods. Ie. before park opening and after fireworks/parades.

It was very annoying to have to pay a $25 early check in fee in order to get an available room at 2 instead of 4.   The room itself left some to be desired.  The carpet, drapes and furniture were well worn and outdated.

At the beginning and end of the day, if you are not early in the morning or leaving the park before closing, plan on waiting a while to get on a shuttle, which really sucks after a day of line waiting.

Once again we had a pleasant stay. Our room was large enough for our party of four (Mum, Dad, and 2 'kids' in their 20's). We were usually so tired by the time we got to bed that we figured we might as well save the money and have one room as the beds are plenty big enough, and very comfy. The only problem to having 4 to a room was having one bathroom on days you were trying to get out quickly for Disneyland!
