Overall this Travelodge is in need of a fresh coat of paint, and a lot of updating, but our room on the west side was clean, quiet, and comfortable for my grown son and me.   Staff was polite and helpful.  I suspect the east side would have been less pleasant because of the much more busy Pacific Coast Highway.   Lower level parking under the hotel with entry on the west side was very convenient.    Walk across the non-busy side street on the west side and you will find Sunset beach.  There is the beginning of a very long blacktop walking/running/biking trail along the beach.

On the plus side, the yogurt was naturally sweetened instead of gunked up with artificial sugar substitutes. Coffee was about all I could stomach after they ran out of oatmeal, but they did at least have fresh fruit, which was good but not sufficiently filling all by itself.

Our room was nice and I loved the bed!  The bathroom was very small with the sink on the outside of the toilet/shower area, which was fine for me.  Our room faced the street which was very noisy and nothing worth looking at!

The most positive thing I can say about this place is that it does have free internet and parking. It is a little on the grungy and dirty side and there is a bus stop right across the street so you hear constant traffic. It is right next to the beach however there is no decent surf in the immediate area and the beach is kind of gross.,November 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,692,287
