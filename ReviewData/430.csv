We were told by numerous people that this was a very nice park and it was.  The swimming lagoon was great for swimming, rafting, and our kids (9,11,14) had a great time.  The sand is dusty and the area around the lagoon is muddy but the kids didn't seem to mind.  We spent half a day on Balboa Island which is about a mile or more away.  It's a nice walk and the area is beautiful.  You can bring your towels along and walk to the beach (a total of 2 miles away from the Dunes).

We found nothing in the web site mentioning the need for life jackets. One more thing- listen for the airplanes take off starting near 7am from OC airport (very loud).
