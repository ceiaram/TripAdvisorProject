To begin with, the bed was rock hard, the pillows were the size of large basketballs, the chair was ripped and torn, and the maids ran out of hand towels.  Worse yet, in the morning, we had no hot water.  When I finally tracked down the manager (i.e., no one was at the front desk or answering the phone), she exploded at me as if it were my fault that there was no hot water in our room.  As I tried to explain the water situation, she sarcastically told me to find another hotel if I was unhappy with this Best Western…which we ended up doing.

It was conveniently located on Beach Blvd.  We did not need to be near the beach (it's 2 miles away), nor did we need anything fancy.  It was clean.  Mihir at the front desk was very nice to deal with.  The breakfast was fine - pretty standard for this type of property, although I'd say the scrambled eggs and sausage were better than most. There were also hard-cooked eggs, which is a nice option.  (I cannot eat cereals or breads, which is why I'm focused on the protein, but there were cereals, waffles, etc. for those who can eat them).

Also, the price was much less than many hotels in the area, the people who worked there were extremely nice, and there was one employee who worked in the small dining area, keeping the food stocked at breakfast, which was included in the price. On the minus side, it isn't what the one might expect from the name.  It was a three story building with all the rooms on one side facing the parking lot.  It was sufficiently quiet when we were there, but I could see that noise could be a problem.  The food at breakfast was white flour based, with bagels, croissants, rolls, toast, and cereal.
