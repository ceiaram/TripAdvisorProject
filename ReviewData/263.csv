53 helpful votes,60 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location and hotel,"We stayed at this multi-story hotel Jan 2012.  It is in a convenient location near Knotts Berry Farm and Disneyland, and just off the freeway.  The hotel is clean and managed well and our room (223) was clean, well lit and equipped.  Although the freeway is a short distance away, there was no noise from it.  The only reason I give this hotel a 4 rating instead of 5 is that there was two school sports teams booked into the hotel at the same time we were there.  There was considerable noise in the halls late (we were with 6 year old children).  And in the morning at breakfast time, there were roughly 50 teenagers in the breakfast area eating.  They were lined up against the walls, sitting in the hall, in the lounge area, in the front desk area, etc.  We could not even reach the",January 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,360,263

The hotel was a mile away from the theme park, which was extremely convenient. My room was extremely spacious and clean, and my bed was super comfy. The parking was free as well, which is always nice to have. No complaints whatsoever, I really enjoyed my stay!",January 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,361,263
2 helpful votes,8 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,great stay during Christmas time,"We used our Marriott points and get upgraded to the king suite.   Room: There are 2 full bathrooms, 2 TVs, a larger-than-dorm-size mini fridge, microwave, and even enough room for 2 kids to run around.  Room is clean with bright color furniture, bathrooms are a bit small but we're only staying for 3 days so it didn't bother us.  An extra rollaway bed is $10 per night. Our room is very close to the elevator and we can hear a lot of people walking and talking on the hallway.  Location: The hotel is not too far away from highway 5. It's less than 10 mins from Disney and less than 5 mins from Knott Berry Farm. There's a Target on the other side of Beach Blvd. You can also find fast food places (e.g. Subway) around.  ** Free round trip shuttle to the Disney and Knott Berry Farm that",December 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,362,263
106 helpful votes,222 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,I liked it much better when it was a Hampton Inn,"I have stayed here many times before when it was a Hampton Inn and I liked it better then.  Sure the rooms are refurbished and spruced up a little now, but the direct lies told by the front desk clerks can't overcome that.  Room looks nice and new, but small.  Bathroom is virtually unusable.  Sink is tucked into a walled in area (see picture), no sink space to lay things and shower/toilet room door opens right into anyone at the sink.  Shower/toilet room is a dank dark cave, spend a few bucks and put a higher wattage light in there.  Breakfast was unappealing and too many screaming running uncontrolled kids there.  Parents did nothing to try to control them.  Now the direct lie by the front desk night person.  There were NO vending machines on the floors, they force you to come",November 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,363,263

56 helpful votes,97 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Good location.,"Good location from Disneyland. Only about a 7 minute drive. The staff is great, very polite and attentive. Rooms however are a bit on the small side. Bathroom was extremely small. Elevators were broken and we got stuck for several minutes each time we used them. Breakfast was disappointing as I always look forward to making waffles when I stay at the Marriott Hotels but, this time around no waffles or no fresh fruit. The eggs and other items did not look appetizing, at least they had juice, yogurt and cereal for your little ones. Overall hotel was alright but I'll probably stay somewhere else next time.",October 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,366,263

77 helpful votes,91 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Value!,I don't normally stay in this grade hotel.  I was pleasantly surprised.  We stayed here to go to Knotts Berry Farm the next day so that we would not have to drive far first and would wake up fresh in the morning for a long fun day at the park.  The hotel room was very clean and up to date.  They served a WONDERFUL complimentary breakfast the next morning.  It was on the same level that we have paid for before at Westins and the like.  I would definitely stay here again for our next trip to Knotts.  Great for familys and business travelers!,September 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,368,263
