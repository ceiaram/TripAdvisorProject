If not - read on!  The property is clean. There is a homeless encampment just outside of the driveway that was pretty sketchy. The first indicator of a problem was mid-evening when there were not one but TWO separate domestic disputes going on in the parking lot with swearing a door slamming.  There was a man and a woman in the room next to me and apparently she was cheating on her boyfriend. The boyfriend showed up and pounded on the door, screamed, yelled awful things and was quite terrifying when only 15 feet from my door.  At 3am the boyfriend was back screaming and pounding on the door.

Within minutes of checking in, it was evident groups of adults were partying in rooms.

The mattress we’re old terrible spring ones and two beds hardly fit in the room.   The pool looked gross. The bathtub was gross, too. Both old and need a good scrub. Most of the room was grimy.

I was concerned that the area did not seem the greatest and the property seemed a little run-down. The room I was given was okay, but as is always the case with Motel 6, no frills.  I had asked from  a quiet room, since the motel is right next to the very busy 405 freeway.   I think they gave me the quietest location possible, but, it was still fairly loud, but not too bad, considering the amount of traffic on the freeway.    The WiFi (currently $2.99 for 24 hours access) was fine.  Overall, I was a bit concerned about staying here, and I am unsure if I would stay again.

After 3 hours, went back to the front desk and asked to speak with a manager. I asked him if he knows that we have been waiting 3 hours for towels. I then asked him if this was acceptable to him. He said that the girl is on lunch. I then advised him that we arrived at 1:30 pm and it is now 4:30 pm and that the cleaning cart and the door next to ours is open. So she has been on a 3 hour lunch.

This was our second time staying at this property. I know Motel 6 is a no-frills place, but this place seemed worse this trip, 2 years later.
