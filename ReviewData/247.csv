Hotel 414 is always our choice as the service, housekeeping, accommodations are above and beyond any other “larger” hotel chain. The rooms are clean, quiet & wonderfully stocked. David and his family make our stay so special with always being available at the desk (and if he can’t be, making sure accommodations are made in his absence), hydrating water bottles for long park days, really just making sure we’re taken care of. I recommend Hotel 414 to anyone who asks for hotel recommendations & it will always be the #1 choice for us.

32 helpful votes,11 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Fantastic stay at this hidden gem!,Hotel 414 is a beautifully renovated motel. The owner is SO nice and the property was incredible. Our room was immaculate and we think this is one of the nicest motels we have ever stayed in. They did an amazing job with the remodel of the rooms. They did not cut any corners. The room was spacious and we loved the shower! The beds and pillows were also very comfortable. This motel was also very quiet! We never heard any noise from other guests.

However, wouldn’t recommend or stay again.  The service was bad from manager/owner- no one was ever at reception and it was always locked. You had to dial a number for assistance but this isn’t helpful when you have an overseas phone which can’t dial in USA. We got locked out our room at 10pm - finally manager came to help but an apology was never given for the lack of service.
