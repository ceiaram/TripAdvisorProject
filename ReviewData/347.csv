As you clearly stated, your friend intentionally lied to our night audit receptionist and claimed to be staying in your room and provided not only the name on the reservation but additionally the accompanying address and phone number along with various other details known only to the reserving party. The act of your friend has caused a violation for both the hotel and yourself. In this case your friend violated and disrespected your own privacy by going beyond relational measures to try to forcible enter into your private quarters through deceiving means.

Husband and I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend for our anniversary. We were looking for someplace quaint but centrally located to restaurants and activities. Little Inn definitely fits the bill in that respect.

The parking lot itself is small, as are the spaces, which was quite irritating. We have a truck - so you can imagine the creativity involved with parking.  The hotel itself is a dump.

We regretted our booking the first time we drove past, and quite frankly this didn't improve, when we got into the room.  There was a stain in the middle of the bedding, the room was tiny, the decor was from the 80's, the air conditioning was a bodge job, and the room was located metres from a busy street, with an adjacent liquor store....

Since we both love the Newport Beach area, we figured it might be fun to try a last minute stay in this motel.   Now, I do have to admit that the front desk clerk was really nice. But the room we stayed in was like something out of a bad 80's ghetto movie. The liquor/convenience store next door seemed to attract some loud and very suspicious looking looking people very late at night.  The rolling room airconditioner was loud enough to keep us awake, but not loud enough to mask two women arguing outside the liquor store next door.
