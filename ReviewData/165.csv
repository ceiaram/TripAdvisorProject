We thought we might just stay for one night (Sat.) and move to another nearby hotel brand that we have more trust in. Surprisingly, we were amazed by the overall quality of the place and the team and we ended up staying for the entire three nights. This experience really has lifted up our impression on Best Western. BTW, their breakfast was of restaurant quality, cooked to order, with a variety of choices on fruits, drinks and breads, all fresh and yummy!!   We definitely would stay here again for our next trip in summer. By then, we probably can jump into their sparkling pool....",March 2019,none,none,Thank you for staying with us!
