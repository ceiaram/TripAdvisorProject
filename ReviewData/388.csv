35 helpful votes,177 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Do not book here unless desperate !,We booked in advance as we needed to be in Santa Ana area for the following day. We called to let them know we would be arriving late & when we arrived we went to reception. The reception smelt like a badly run indian restaurant. Parking was limited. We went to our room and found it to be shabby & uncared for. The air conditioning unit was missing the switch panel and I had to put my hand into it to switch the micro switches. VERY UNSAFE. The bathroom light didn't work so you couldn't use the mirror. The hair dryer consisted of a bracket but no hair dryer and the plug next to it didn't work either! When we complained the next day they told us we should have complained when we arrived. It was 1245am ! We just wanted to sleep.,May 2016,"Book elsewhere, it's awful here",Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,388
none,6 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,ok,"This place is ok not good or bad just ok like they say you pay for what you get!!! Free Wifi??? umm more like if you wanna be outside the room because wifi doesn't work IN the room! the receptionist was nice they just need better security in the place because the day I got there their was a guy that looked like he wanted business with anything that he could get! this place is good if you just need something cheap to stay, the room was clean that I can say.",April 2016,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,388
23 helpful votes,94 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Not worth the price,Stayed for three nights. This is a bare bones motel in a sketchy neighborhood. Stayed because it was a short drive to convention center and everything closer was more expensive and booked. Room is bare bones and clean. Bed is so so. Internet is slow and sketchy. No coffee in room. There is a refrigerator and microwave. No reading light by the bed. No desk. Furniture is horribly beat up like from a bad garage sale. I will not ever stay here again. The positive reviews must be planted unless they paid a lot less than I did.,March 2016,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,388
2 helpful votes,2 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't stay here...,"This room was.. bad. Besides the ""No prostitution"" sign outside (which didn't keep prostitutes away when I got back from Disney Land around midnight...), I had a stained chair in my room.. You know.. Stained like someone sat on it...and well... stained it... Yeah. I mean, things happen but maybe you should replace the chair? The room simply was not clean and the furniture was broken. I paid nearly $100 for this room on both Thursday and Friday night. Don't waste your money at this hotel that puts you and your family in a dangerous area of town that doesn't even have clean rooms.",March 2013,none,Traveled with family,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,4,388
7 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good stay for the price,"Bottom line: Don't expect a four star resort for the price you pay. Does the motel need a little work? Yes. Is the place clean, the maid service excellent, and the beds comfortable? I can almost guarantee it.  It's also in a great location. You are walking distance to Knott's Berry Farm, Target, Buger King, Denny's, Black Angus, ect. I couldn't have asked for a much better stay than this...will definitely be coming back!",January 2012,none,none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,388
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Customer service,"I went to this hotel on 12/20/2011 to inquire about its price on a room with regular bed and one occupant. The male attendant gave me an outrageous price of $89 for one night. All the other surrounding motels were asking for around $45 for one night. The  "" We'll leave the light on for you motel"" was asking for around $45. He saw my face and inflated his price so I would not stay there. I call later using an middle eastern accent and the price went down to $55 for the same room I inquired about in person. I will never go there again nor will i recommend it.",December 2011,none,Traveled on business,none,2.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,6,388
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My Trip to DisneyLand,"I had a good time at the motel. It was very clean and the rooms were better than the best western. I had a big in-room jacuzzi in my room and the flat screen TV was amazing. The customer service was also very good. My husband and I really enjoyed ourselves, especially the pool it was really cozy.",April 2009,none,Traveled with family,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,7,388
