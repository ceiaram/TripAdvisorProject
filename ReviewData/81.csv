9 helpful votes,26 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Hotel is in disrepair and needs a deep cleaning.,"This hotel was a conference hotel for the AAP national convention, so I had higher expectations for it. On arrival, I noted a heavy perfumed smell in the lobby. The clerks at the desk are kind and helpful.  Room was on 2nd floor of the main hotel. Entering the elevator, noted a slight smell - a bit stale and a bit like the sewer. When the elevator opened on the 2nd floor, the sewer smell was much stronger. I could smell it on entry into my room but was much lighter than the hallway smell. The carpet has a stiffness to it that suggests it is old and brittle or just poor quality. When barefoot, it just doesn't feel clean. The furniture is well-worn and, in some areas, dented/scratched.

I booked through a 3rd party site and at a very last minute we had decided to extend our vacation before getting there. Unfortunately they weren’t available to put it on the same reservation and had to be made as a separate booking. Which then had us to be moved from our family suite room into a smaller room.  However, when I originally checked us in I had asked if it was possible to combine everything into one or another booking room and it wasn’t.

It isn't the fanciest place, but the rooms are clean and comfy and the location is perfect. Just a short walk up the street to Disneyland and walking distance to lots of restaurants. CVS is right next door which is very handy for extra supplies (like half & half for coffee and sunscreen)  We especially love it for the family suite rooms. They have a king bed for us parents in one room. Go thru the french doors to the back room where there is a bunk bed with 2 twins and a pull out sofa couch. Plus a fridge and coffee maker, and tvs in each room.   The French doors have glass and thin curtains. So you wont get 100% privacy.

The hot tub had so many bubbles and chlorine it burned my eyes.   The issues happened the next day, day 2, I woke up with a rash and hives all over my skin on anything that touched the bed sheets.

The first day I got there it was raining and cold and the room heat wasn’t working. I called and they immediately sent maintenance to switch over the AC to heat. The front staff was very nice and accommodating, giving me a first floor room because I mentioned I was tired. The hotel is close to several convenience stores and quick food options. The bed was comfy and the room was spacious. There was only one mirror so I would suggest adding a few more. The surrounding hotels are much more expensive than this hotel so I would recommend this as a great alternative to them.

This hotel is walking distance from the Disney parks, downtown Disney and the convention center. They have a lovely pool and hot tub too! With that said, we had to be here for 5 nights for business over at the convention center. I guess my main complaints would be the fact that they didn’t give us coffee cups for the rooms, no continental breakfast was offered and there are no coffee stations in the lobby.

This area is such a ""mixed-use""  area, that I really feel that any review written about hotels in this area need to be read a bit more thoroughly than in other locations, as what may be important to some travelers here, will matter very little to the others.

I would stay at this hotel at least once a year for the last 5-7 years. However, this last trip really just left a bad taste in my mouth.  1. The furniture is really outdated. 2.

Not too sure if they were bed bugs or not, but there were quite a few that I found.  Attached, you will see one that I was able to take a picture of (that was alive and moving on the pillow).

5 helpful votes,3 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Good but not great stay at hotel with kids suite,"We picked this hotel specifically because it is in reasonable walking distance to the Disney parks and Downtown Disney (which it is) and because it has two ""separate"" rooms; however, the sliding glass French doors between the rooms didn't provide the kind of privacy we had been hoping for so we didn't sleep quite as undisturbed as we had hoped. Everything was clean enough and the room/rooms were big enough. We just would have liked for the sliding French doors to have actually been attached with less of a gap on both sides between the door and the wall it is on. Also the curtains on the doors should be darker or heavier since we could see each other's TV screens while laying there in the dark.

With a family of five we appreciated the flexibility to split the room for adults and children. Beds were confortable. The kids loved the bunk beds and the endless selection of channels (I enjoyed that feature too if I'm honest).

The room was nice -- very close to the lobby so I was afraid it would be loud, but it was really quiet. The staff was lovely. It was not a fancy hotel but it was serviceable. The only thing I would have liked was if they had small safes in each room. I used a safe deposit box at the front desk -- which worked fine, but they didn't have any separate area where you could access it without being right in front of everyone.   The room had a fridge, which I love! And a small patio -- with a nice high railing so I wasn't worried about anyone trying to get in.

We got a King Suite so we could have a separate sleeping area from our toddlers, but the sliding French-style doors that separated the two rooms had sheer drapes and weren't sealed. So our kids could see our light on and us moving about the room - this prevented them from going to sleep. So we would have to turn out our lights and go to bed at the same time as our kids, which was what we were trying to avoid by getting the suite. Also, the pool was very small, and not friendly to small children. It was 3 feet at entry and 5 feet in the deeper end.

We had no reservations so when we got there, the front desk suggested that we check online (http://www.portofinoinnanaheim.com) for deals.  They allowed us to use their wifi and we ended up finding a savings of 25% off the hotel price.  2) Hotel is very clean and comfortable.  After a long day of walking through Disney, the last thing we wanted was to go back to a hotel room that was dirty and uncomfortable. The Portofino was neither of these.

It seemed old and rather beat up, though in the pictures looks very new. Our room smelled like mold and the vent in the ceiling was coming off. We drove down the street to Target and had to pick up dryer sheets to stick in the vent and Febreeze to stay in the room because it was so smelly. This made it..almost bearable.

The hotel was part of a Disneyland package via CostCo. Originally, I reserved a deluxe room with two queen beds, but upon checking in, discovered that the kid suites were in a separate building from the deluxe rooms. Since one of my roles was assistant child wrangler, this situation would not work for us. When I found out that upgrading to a suite was only $30 more per night, we were able to get two adjoining suites, and the children could go back and forth safely and easily.

Since the hotel was already booked and paid for I set about the task of reading guest reviews just to get an idea of what I was in for. Before I describe my experience I want to say I would have booked this hotel anyway; I was extremely impressed straight off the back with the percentage of follow up responses from management to the reviewers. The simple fact that an establishment actually makes time to read guest reviews, evaluate them, and follow up adds a touch of quality and class that’s unmatched.

The big plus was the large room with the bunk beds which our children loved.  The proximity to the park is also a big plus an easy walk to and from the park even with children who still nap and no strollers.  Having a fridge and microwave saved us money. The beds were comfy.     Downsides...the smell from the disinfectant  IS overpowering and on the second day I figured out why.  The tile floor in the bathroom is so old that the glaze coating is gone which means every time the floor is cleaned, the natural stone just sucks up the cleanser, each time the tiles would get wet from a towel or shower the smell would become extremely strong again.

Which isn't a real problem except at night. 2. We asked for an upgrade to the kid's suite so my teenager can have her own area. The a/c unit was really noisy and we couldn't even hear the tv. We had to have the a/c on when it was 45 degrees outside because the room was so hot. 3. You will be charged for local calls. Which is not stated on any paperwork until you get charged.

We stayed at Kids Suite which we were very please with our king size bed, a seperate room with a second tv, sofa sleeper, bunk beds and a small table with two stools for my son's playtime. However, the rooms were not cleaned up well and toilet got backed up(although they fixed it rather quickly) during our stay. We got double charged with our dry cleaning service. If I hadn't checked our receipt, I would have never known. They did reimburse us after debating about it for few minuites.

5 helpful votes,6 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I would DEFINATLY stay here again,"I was VERY nervous about satying at the Portofino after reading the reviews here. My kids loved the room. I loved the fact that they had their ""own room"".The nights we were not at the park we watched the fireworks from the comfort of our beds. The location was terrific, the back end of the park was litterally across the street. We made the mistake of driving to the park one day and the walk from the parking garage was double the walk from the hotel! The only bad thing I can say about the hotel was the size of the pool. Do not expect a bigger inground pool than may be in your own backyard. Clean rooms, great location, reasonably helpful but very courteous staff, what more can you ask for.

Based on some of the comments made in earlier reviews, we requested a room at the back so that we would not hear the street noise. We had a kids suite, which included a king bed for us and bunk beds for the kids.  This really worked out well and saved us some money. Our room was a decent size and very clean. For the price, this is a great deal. FYI, it's a good walk to Disney from the hotel (about 10 minutes).

The hotel staff were very nice and helpful. We arrived a few hours before check-in and the staff allowed us to get our room key and go to our room. The room itself, was very nice. We have 2 boys aged 6 and 9 years and they loved it! The walk to Disneyland is relatively short, but after our first full day in DL and our son complaining his feet hurt, we decided on the tram. The tram stopped RIGHT outside the hotel and made one stop and took us to Disneyland. It was quick, and not crowded at all, and always on time! The only thing we didn't like was the small and crowded swimming pool! But we all had a great time and would definitely stay here again for",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2029,81

Within a 10 minute drive is a large Albertsons which provided the makings for breakfast and many healthy snacks, saving us alot of money once in the park. The kids enjoyed having their own area, T.V. and mini table and chairs. We had privacy once they were in bed. The front desk staff were pleasant and helpful. We walked every day. It took us less than 10 minutes walking briskly. We had a stroller for our 2 & 5 year old. It would have been too far for them to walk.  Although the pool was small the kids still had a blast.

After paying for our Disney package, which included the hotel, I read some not-so-great reviews by other people on this website. I think some of those people were expecting too much from a family hotel. We thought the hotel was great. We booked a Kids' Suite. Our kids (ages 10 & 13) slept on the bunkbeds, each bed having its own reading light. Our room had a comfortable king size bed.

Before we took the trip, I decided to do some research on the hotel we would be staying. I read some reviews on tripadvisor and was worried about some of the things I read about the Portofino Inn & Suites; even then, the good reviews seemed to outweigh the bad ones. The Portofino Inn & Suites is one of the most comfortable hotels we have stayed at. Ever since we walked in the front doors, we were greeted with a smile and staff that really cared.

We chose it because it was listed as 0.4km from disney and the staff said a 7-9 min. walk, but that was incorrect. Even if you made the green light, it was a 15min walk at a fast pace, and being pregnant this was too far when you factor the whole day inside the park. We bought shuttle tickets, but that was worse because you have to wait 20min, people were cutting in line, no help or room for strollers, shuttle couldn't fit everyone - just aggravating.

I discovered the Portofino one time while in Anaheim on a business trip (I was staying at one of the ""Big Box"" hotels) and thought it looked great for a future visit to the park with my family.Well, I was right  - they have these ""kids suites"" that have a room with a queen bed, plus an adjoining room with bunk beds for the kids.   What a great idea!   Even better is the french doors that separate the kids' room from the main room, so that you can tuck the kids in early, and still enjoy some down time before hitting the park again in the morning.We have stayed twice, and both times we have been pleased with the accommodations.

We ended up paying for an ""extra"" night ($239), we had paid for this already, and had our confirmation on this.
