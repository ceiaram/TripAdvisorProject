We planned our trip very spur of the moment, during the busiest time of year, but we were able to secure one night at this gem of a campground. They squeezed us in knowing how much it meant to us to stay there. It's fantastic!   Not only is the campground clean and well maintained, it's got awesome amenities, and it's only 10 minutes from Disneyland! That is a big draw for us, as most other campgrounds are at least double that for distance and that can mean the difference between a fifteen minute drive and over half an hour!

44 helpful votes,46 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sorely Disappointed!,"My husband and I stayed at Orangeland for 19 days in October. We paid for a pull through, and weren’t thrilled at how close we were to our neighbors. This was the tightest spot we’ve ever been put in. Instead of grass, we had mud right outside the steps with a tiny patch of brown grass. Thankfully I had a rug to put down or we would have mud all over our rig. They made it worse by watering the mud with loud sprinklers early morning. Speaking of noise, there is a big sports bar adjacent to the park and the noise and racing cars and motorcycles up and down the street at 2 am woke us up every night. The quiet hours are not observed as we had very loud neighbors sitting outside at midnight partying, it seemed like right next to my window. They also called us after two days and said",October 2019,none,none,"Thank you for taking the time to leave us a detailed review. In regards to the spacing of our lots, we firmly believe we have more than adequate spacing. The lots are separated by grass strips, which when watered, can turn to mud. As for the quiet hours you mentioned, there is a sports bar that does stay open until 2AM; unfortunately, we cannot dictate their noise level-- however, we do have security on site that all guests are given access to that are responsible for enforcing the quiet hours. The 2 dog limit per site is based on a city ordinance, regardless of the size of the dog. We do apologize for any miscommunication but we do make sure to advise our guests of this ordinance beforehand. The dog park is much bigger than 10 x 8 as you mentioned and the dog park is maintained on a daily basis with enzymes and other maintenance techniques. Finally, checkout to our sites is 11am and checkin does not begin until 1pm. The reason for the 2 hour gap is to clean and do any upkeep before our next guests arrive. Because of this, it is very likely that there appears to be openings but in reality, these lots are booked.

We like it because it's not the mega KOA in Pamona filled with rental RV's and unfriendly people.  And it's not just a parking lot like some of the other area rv parks.   Most all the trees are citrus.  There for guests to pick at will. We keep a citrus juicer in the rv just for Orangeland.  We have fresh OJ every morning.   Staff are very nice. They all seem it be full timers here in the park. Have great pride in keeping the place nice and being helpful.   Prices are a little high, but they don't nickel and dime you. We like to stay in the premium spots with patio furniture and umbrella. Also extra spot to park a car.   They have pool table, shuffle board, swimming pool, covered playground, and a nice BBQ area with stainless steel grills.",December 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,87,420
1 helpful vote,2 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,TOO EXPENSIVE!,"I stayed here a few months ago and I have to say that this place is way too expensive for how the place looks!  There are junky sites everywhere and noisy people.  To pay what I paid to stay there which was over $1000, I had to look at junk, hear yappy noisy dogs in the 2 sites behind us, hammering metal by the same people behind us and then at night they would be out laughing and talking really loud.  I would not stay in the sites 44-48 because the noisy people and their yappy noisy dogs stay in the sites that back up to those sites and the junkiest site is in front of sites 44-48.",June 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,88,420

Minutes from Disneyland and you can walk to the angels games and circus! The pool is fantastic and you are away from the chaotic crowds of anaheim and the Disney strip on harbour boulevard.  Staff is warm and friendly and they can accommodate pretty much all size RVs.,August 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,89,420
