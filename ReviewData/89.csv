I have spoken with the Assistant General Manager about what happened last weekend.  It is my understanding that you and your party did not report to the front desk that the sofa bed was broken.  We do have rollaway beds available which we could have easily brought to the room until the sofa bed could be repaired.  This would have also solved the problem of sleeping on the floor.  We do use cleaning solutions and several methods to keep the carpets clean.  Also general wear and tear on hotel carpet is higher than at home so I would agree that sleeping on the floor is not the best alternative.   Marriott has been smoke free since 2007.  It is stated on all key packets that ‘We are committed to a smoke-free policy.  A $250 room recovery fee will be charged for smoking in your room”.  Housekeeping reported smoke in the room and it was confirmed by their supervisor.   The sign you refer to on the entrances to the hotel is to comply with Prop 65.

The 405 runs in back of the hotel, so take note if freeway noise is an issue.    The rooms are basic, which is what we expected so no surprises there.  The room appeared clean with the exception of the carpet that looked like it was due for a cleaning.  The airconditioning is noisy and rattly to the point where we had trouble sleeping and turned it off.  The room then became overwhemingly stuffy and being the window only opened about 4 inches  getting a solid nights sleep was difficult.  I liked having a mini-frige in thr room.
