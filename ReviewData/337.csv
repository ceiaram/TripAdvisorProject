We wanted something close to an airport (Orange County) and Disneyland.  This worked well for short..under an hour ... drives. We had a group of six adults and three children. The rooms were comfortably furnished. The bed and linens and pillows were good quality.  The pull out couch in the living room was much more comfortable than the usual foldout.  We were provided with a crib and high hair.  The kitchen is basic but everything worked. When asked the staff was quick to provide any extras (detergent and even a blowup mattress).

40 helpful votes,59 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great beach get away for couples and families,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this condo resort directly across the street from a state beach. The unit was spacious and clean, featured a fully equipped kitchen, and offered beach views from both the deck off the living room and the large window in the bedroom. An added plus was a gas barbecue on the deck, and we liked the underground parking. We enjoyed the inexpensive beach cruiser bike rentals, video arcade, large pool, and soothing Jacuzzis. Riviera Shores is close to Dana Point Harbor, and we enjoyed a bike cruise by the state beach and through this scenic harbor area. The resort seems very family friendly, and offers something for everyone. Three restaurants are just a short stroll away.

As soon as we entered and she saw the unit and the view of the ocean she blurted out ""I love it!""  We only spent two nights, but they were wonderful, the place was clean, the staff attentive if needed, and niether of us was bothered in the least by the traffice on PCH or the trains going by across the street.  The bed was comfortable, I wasn't bothered by my neighbors and everything worked as it should.  The only negative was that the closest elevator was down at our checkout time.

People talking, moving chairs, running a shower, open/close doors, etc.  Stay here if you are a sound sleeper or if you party till 4am (you'll keep everyone else up, but you'll be fine). The units were very nice, but I prefer a concrete building. The building is long and narrow and is wedged between the hillside and the coast hwy.  The rear units literally face a retaining wall holding up the cliff-side (you could reach out and touch it, you may as well not have windows).  The front units overlook the coast hwy and the train tracks just across the street. They have a beach/ocean view.

8 helpful votes,3 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,An interesting Mix,"I needed an affordable place to stay while on business, and this fit the bill.  It was definitely an interesting mix of amenities and services.  It was clear tha most guests were vacationing, which was fine.  The front of the hotel has a lovely view of the ocean, while the back looks at a wall of dirt.  The downside to the front of the hotel is noise- a major road and an active train track run just in front of the hotel.  I found the trains bothersome the first night, but really didn't hear them after that.    The biggest advantage to this place is the full kitchen in each unit.  And I mean full kitchen!  Range top, full size fridge, nicest microwave I've ever seen, dishwasher, regular size coffee pot, blender (!), all the dishes, pots, and pans you could want, PLUS, a full size",August 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,75,337

There is a pedestrian overpass nearby which takes you over the Pacific Coast highway and the railway to the beach. The Blues Fest provided a complimentary shuttle service to the Festival which was a couple of miles away. We were on the fourth floor so didn't find the passing trains too disruptive. Large balcony with a BBQ. The kitchens are well equipped for those who wish to cook their own meals. The rooms were well appointed and good value @ $141 CDN/night.

We had been here before about 2 yrs. ago. Since then I noticed they have done a few upgrades. They updated the kitchen cabinets and appliances and they updated the bedroom mattresses and bedspreads to a more comfortable & modern look. Also they upgraded the TV from the bedroom. We saved a lot on eating out since we took food to cook/ grill. They have a kitchen supplied with everything one can need and they have a gas grill in the balcony. They also have salt and pepper and complimentary coffee for the first two nights, more is available in the vending  machines.

It was a 1 bedroom, nice large bathroom and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything one might need.  The lanai was nice to sit on at night with a cocktail and coffee in the morning.  There was a bbq on the lanai also which we didn't use.  The only problem we had was that the bed was soooo hard we hurt.  So we went to a Walmart and bought a foam topper and that did the trick.

After reading some of the reviews on this site, I was weary about what I would find.  However, from the time I arrived until the time I left my stay at the resort was very positive.  The room I was in was clean and had everything I needed in it to be comfortable.  Now I don't think I would stay at this resort if I just wanted to stay there and relax but that is only because of the traffic and the train that passes by it seems like every 10 minutes.

The location is fine, right across PCH from the beach. You can access the beach via a walking bridge & you can ride bikes to Dana Point or San Clemente without too much difficulty. The positives pretty much stop there. The one bedroom has a wall around the bedroom that stops 3 feet from the ceiling as does the door for the bedroom, not private by any means. The Interval site lists a resteraunt on the 4th floor- not so, it closed more than 6 months ago!

The resort is older and kind of a no-frills place, however our 2 bedroom suite was extremely spacious and fairly comfortable with a living room, dining room, balcony with bbq, kitchen and 2 bathrooms.  The master bedroom was enormous and included a double sink and jetted tub.  The 2 bedroom suites do not have an ocean view but look out on a steep hillside.  The pool was adequate and appeared to be clean.  We were able to check out bicycles to ride along the beach.

It also has really thin walls that betray every noise from your neighbors. And the room shakes a little when the train rumbles pass. A little discerning as it feels like an earthquake.    However the end of our trip was ruined. The second to last day of our stay, we decided to rent out bikes from the Riviera to go cycling. However upon trying to unlock the broken lock, the key snapped. We went back to the people to tell them and they told us we now owed $20 for a broken lock. After talking to the manager the lock price was reduced to $10.
