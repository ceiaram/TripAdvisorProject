Between the room and the beach is the very busy PCH 4-lane highway and the train tracks with several trains per hour by day and more than a few at night.  The road and traffic less than a car length from the room essentially make the nice little porch unusable and you won't be able to leave the doors or windows open to enjoy the breeze.

There is often confusion of the difference between a Hotel and a Motel.  A Motel is a location where your vehicle is able to park in front of the room door, hence the ""Mo""=Motor (for Motor car).  Motels are mainly for the more budget minded traveler who is on the go.  A Hotel indicates a more home like feel, ""Ho""= Home/ Hospitality.  Hotels are more for relaxation and for the traveler who is looking for a bit more luxury and home like atmosphere.  Our hotel has an underground parking structure separate from the rooms with luxurious accomodations, thus Hotel.  Incidentals are a requirement at every hotel, regardless of any type of extra services that the hotel may additionally charge for.  Mainly, incidentals are held for any type of damages that may be incurred during a stay.  We do not hold much in comparison to other hotels in our area and hope our minimal holding did not tie up any necessary funds.  Unfortunately the resort fee is clearly stated on Hotels.com during the time of booking.  We do understand that there is quite a bit of wording and sometimes things can be overlooked.  When booking with our hotel directly, we can often waive the resort fee.  We hope our explanation has clarified some confusion and will hopefully ease the process of your next hotel experience. If you decided to return to our area of Dana Point, please allow us to point out the beach access bridge only 3 buildings to the north or the surface access at the traffic light, 2 buildings to the south.

The MetroLink train runs by about every 20 minutes and when going south, blows the heck out of it's horn when it get directly adjacent to the hotel.  The last blast I heard was at 2:30am.  There is no access to the beach which is directly across the highway. Between the traffic noise and the train horn you don't need to make the same mistake I did.  Forget any other niceities, you won't get a nights sleep.  There are also several other hotels in Dana Point that share the PCH / train scenario, so before booking, ask their location relative to each. It's not worth it.",July 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,886,182
7 helpful votes,2 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Decent but noisy,"We had mixed feelings about the 1 night we spent at this hotel. However, the only negative factor was really the noise. We had originally booked an ocean view room. When we arrived, we were assigned a room on the first floor directly facing the ocean. Outside our window was the ocean, along with four lanes of traffic and a railroad track. The road is not that busy at night, but during the day, be prepared for a lot of traffic noise. We downgraded to a garden view room, which was in the back and more quiet, but you could still hear the traffic and train. Both rooms were large and adequately furnished for this class of hotel. The sink area is seperate from the toilet/tub room which was convenient. The hotel was very clean and well maintained and the staff was very warm and",November 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,887,182

Lovely gardens and aspect with underground car parking.  1 mile from Dana Point harbour and all amenities.  PCH does run alongside and also train track, but this was not a problem.  Great spot to watch the 'tall ships' do battle in the evening during the Tall Ship Festival.",September 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,888,182

Walkway a short distance away for beach access.  Free breakfast is pretty basic but decent.  Desk staff is friendly and helpful.  Not-so-good points:  It is noisy.  The coast highway is right in front of the hotel, and trains run next to the highway.  Trains are fond of blowing their horns at all hours.  A garden view room is quieter, but you'll still hear the trains.",June 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,890,182
