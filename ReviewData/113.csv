One of the bedside lights was bent to the side and didn't work at all - even after trying a new bulb.  The shower head was misty and barely rinsed me off.  Towels smelled like they had been outside for awhile.  Mattress was very hard (much harder than ""firm""), the desk was wobbly/about the crumble, and the luggage rack was missing one of the main straps, rendering it useless.   My first evening was OK, despite the smell of the room.  However, there was a loud party next door on my 2nd night which lasted 4 hours.  The walls seemed very thin.  I had to blast white noise from the TV just to drown out the hooting and hollering.

I was originally booked at another hotel but I realized that La Quinta was $50 cheaper a night, AND included free parking and breakfast, neither of which was the case at the other place.

The man at the front desk could not have been nicer and he quickly reassured me that I was staying in the old granary section of the hotel and away from the tracks and honestly I never heard any train noise.

The bed was comfortable, but other than that, the room was not a place where one could relax.
