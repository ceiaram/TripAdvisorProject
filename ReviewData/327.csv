We travel a few times a year and always stay at budget hotels. As such, we do not expect to get more than what we paid for and this hotel satisfied our basic needs - a place to shower and sleep - and it seemed decently clean. That said, our overall experience here unfortunately was poor. We had a few security issues with the room, breakfast was not up-to-par (I'd rather not have a free breakfast than have one with dead bugs in it...), and the front desk manager that we dealt with was fairly rude. To be fair, the rest of the staff that we met were polite. Overall, I would NOT recommend this hotel.
