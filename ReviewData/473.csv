Sunset Beach (the area) is a nice place with a decent beach and quality restaurants.  I would recommend the town, but would NOT recommend that you stay here.  I am absolutely appalled that someone would run their business the way that these women do.  My husband and I were given a $300 gift certificate as a wedding gift from friends.  They booked it under the pretense that we would be given a wine & cheese reception and continental breakfast (similar to what another reviewer had mentioned.)  When I called to make the reservation I was told that they were no longer a bed & breakfast and we were fine with that.  We were quoted an off season rate of $175 for the night.  When we arrived, we were given a room for the night.  The",February 2010,none,Traveled as a couple,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,473

We stopped at The Sunset Beach B&B. They only had 1 room available so we took it. The room was beautiful and with all the possible amenities. The place is steps to the ocean and close to some great dining spots.,May 2008,none,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,2,473
64 helpful votes,45 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Should have trusted my instincts and booked elswhere,"My wife and I wanted a quick overnight getaway near our home in Southern California.  We had a gift certificate for a restaurant in Seal Beach (Walt's Wharf - a WONDERFUL place with EXCELLENT food and service - but that's another review) and looked for someplace nearby.  We prefer to stay in B&Bs and came across an alleged B&B:  Sunset B&B.  I should have known from the fact that it took three phone calls before I got a response to make a reservation that we were in for an ugly experience.  The next clue was the ""Why are you bothering me?"" attitude from whomever I spoke with on the phone.  Clue #3:  Although the website reservations said all rooms were available on our designated day, I was told only room number 2 was available.  I was also told that all rooms cost the same",April 2007,none,Traveled as a couple,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,3,473
15 helpful votes,3 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Awesome romantic hideaway,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in July during our destination wedding (we live in Texas and were married on Sunset Beach). We rented a beach house across the street from the B&B for the reception and for family to stay at. The beach house owner recommended this B&B, and I'm so glad he did!   The B&B faces the Pacific Coast Highway, and the beach is a block away. Without our even having to ask, the manager prepared the honeymoon welcome: rose petals on the bed and a bottle of chilled champagne upon our arrival. She was very accommodating and always offering cold drinks when we were hanging out at the B&B. We had room 7, which has its own fireplace and is adjacent to a nice little terrace where we had breakfast and daily wine and cheese platters in the afternoon.
