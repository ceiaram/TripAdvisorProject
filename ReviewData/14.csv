We chose the Sheraton based on proximity to the parks and it being really resonably priced. I should also say that we aren't easy to please in the hotel department. We've been lucky enough to stay in very nice hotels and it has definitely changed our perspective.  We came with two adults and  two boys ages 4 and 6. My son wet the bed and I was so worried about them cleaning the sheets, because some hotels don't come in and clean your room anymore. We got back from the park and the bed was clean and made up. It was such a relief.  The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was also suprisingly large for a hotel. The Shampoo, soap, and conditioner provided smelled so nice.

My experience at the hotel was only four nights but it was perfect.  And an employee named Ivan helped make it so.  He helped me with my room, my reservation, local directions, with my car's wifi, with my google maps, and with the rescue dog!!! Oh my gosh,  I simply do not know what I would have done without his cheerful countenance, charm and extreme helpfulness.  Thank you Ivan and the Sheraton Pasadena!!",January 2023,none,Traveled solo,"Thank you for the fantastic review!  We're delighted to hear that you had an amazing experience at Sheraton Pasadena!
