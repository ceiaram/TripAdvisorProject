Perfect for practical people.,"Family suite room layout wasn't as separated as shown in the photos but the beds were the same: 1 king, and a queen/twin bunk.

76 helpful votes,77 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,I'd give it 3.5 if I could,"We stayed in a family room with bunk beds. On the surface, it was a great room. They have tapped into the fresh, modern vibe for bedding which was great to see. Forest green and red are tired! Considering it was spring break, the price was amazing. We were on the bottom floor, but always able to park in front of our room every time. We bring white noise machines but could hear the people above us all night long, so I'd request a second-floor room. Personally, we don't think it's close enough to Disney to walk. Not a knock on the hotel, but I'd drive to the park or the bus lot (Woody & Friends, I think) closer to the hotel. We chose to drive to the park. Definitely needs some additional work, though.
