So we had $200 less for our Disney vacation than we budgeted for!!!!!!!!! This resulted in our Disney trip being cut short a day.

I'm so sorry that you encountered the multiple issues with smells in the room, as well as someone calling your room and disrupting your rest late at night. Our property is non-smoking, and I hate that your room had a smoking odor when you arrived. Whenever a guest violates our no smoking policy, we take the room out of service for 24 hours to do a deep cleaning, including steam cleaning the carpets and drapes, as well as using a machine that filters the air in the room. It seems in this instance that process wasn't done correctly, and I apologize. I'm working with our maintenance and housekeeping teams to deep clean the room you stayed in, to remove any smoking odor.    Again, I apologize for the inconvenience.

The housekeeping staff is awesome! All areas of the Hotel are very clean. It is located in a quiet area with a ton of different restaurants within 1 block of hotel! Ranging from higher end Italian all the way down to Jack in the box. The breakfast is ALWAYS a +. This Hotel even has windows that open at least 6 inches! Shopping is less than 2 miles! Knotts Berry Farm less than 3 mi. away! Disneyland, less than 8 miles away! If you book at least 2 weeks out, you will find a SUPER deal! (Thats what I always do (o:) If you're traveling on business or Liesure...I would highly recommend this Hotel. GREAT PLACE! GREAT STAFF!! GREAT RATES!!!

We arrived on Sunday afternoon and the parking lot was quite empty. The gentleman at the front desk was the same person who attended to us when we visited back in March. Sorry I didn't get his name but he was wonderful. We asked for a quiet room and we got one on the 7th floor (top) just like last time. The room was clean and got everything we needed. However, in the evening we could hear everything our neighbor was saying, included their dog barkng. We realized that there was connecting door in our room. So my husband went downstairs to see if we could change to a different room. Yep...the gentleman was so professional and gave us a different room without any problem.

As all La Quinta, breakfast was complimentary and included many items. Also, the hotel is little bit outdated as you'll notice but nonetheless it is a very nice business area and near by Knott's Berry Farm and Anaheim Disney area. It's near Buena Park area and close to I-605 freeway.  There is a shopping center near by I believe Cerritos Shopping Center with major brands.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Location,We stayed for a couple of days and we reserved a non smoking room they gave us one. As we approached the lobby it smelled like cigarettes. Not only did the lobby smell it seemed the entire 4th floor smelled like smoke. Our room was on the non smoking side but every time we opened the door it seemed the smell would travel into our room. It was a great stay and the only complaint was the smell.

It's not the Ritz or Four Seasons, but it meets our needs and we keep coming for our youngest daughter's volleyball tournaments (we stay there about 6 times a year from January to June).  The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the hotel provides free internet.  Location is central for all Southern California Volleyball Association (SCVA) tournaments, and close to Knotts Berry Farm and Disneyland.

Sadly, things have not improved and we will not be staying here again.  PROS:  LOCATION:  As I said in my last review, we love the location.  That hasn't changed.  ROOM DESIGN:  It is large and clean, so props for that.    CONS:  SMELL:  Though this place is billed as non-smoking, as with our last stay, there was a strong odor of cigarette smoke, this time upon exiting the elevator on our floor (fourth).  Unfortunately, our room was close by, so the smell got into our room a bit.  There was also another odor in our room that made me want to sneeze.   STAFF:  Hit or miss.  The person who checked us in was just fine.  The person who checked us out was not (see below).

This time however, we were saddened to find that it had slipped in several ways.  PROS:  LOCATION:  We like this place because it's very convenient for us to visit family in this area, as well as the numerous theme parks.  Yet it's just off the usual crowded hotel areas like Beach Blvd, so the traffic and ""busyness"" isn't as bad.  ROOM:  Good size for this type of motel/hotel type property.  Ours was a King/fridge/microwave room with a love seat and very comfortable office type chair and large desk.  We've had recliners in our rooms before, but this office chair was just fine.  As always, the room was clean and functional.  Good water pressure and lighting.

The room itself was very clean, and smelled good. If this is a pet friendly hotel, then I found no sign of it at all. The hallways and elevation where also clean and in workable condition.   The pool area and grounds looked good, though the pool was a bit cool for my taste. Considering the close proximity to Knott's Berry Farm, the property was not too busy at all. Tis despite the fact that it is on a main drag of the city, and many national businesses nearby.   The only downsides were that there are only a few restaurant choices nearby. A Panda Inn, Del Taco, and some sports outfit within walking distance. If you have kids or teenagers, this can be a hassle.
