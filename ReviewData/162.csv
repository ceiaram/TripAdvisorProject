The hotel actually charges the full incidental fee and charges it to your bank and issues a refund in 5-7 business days.

I have never had a hotel do a full charge and a refund for incidentals even high end hotels like the Hilton. I spent over 1 hour calling bank and hotel to see if there were charges to room as we always take a video of the room when leaving the property for our records.

It's right next door to the Ayres Orange Hotel and only 1-2 exits away from Disneyland.  The rooms are nice.  Not quite as large and nice as the rooms in Ayres, but still on the ""upscale"" side.  There's plenty of parking, which is also FREE!  Most of the hotels around the Disneyland resort charge parking.  A bit annoying and can get a bit expensive if you're paying parking at the park and the hotel.    Breakfast is included.  It's the same breakfast that's served over at the Ayres Hotel next door.

The actual room was smaller than it looks in the photos, and we had to ask for more towels to accommodate all of us every day. The outside noise was excessive to us, but we are from a small town with little street noise, so it might be our problem, not the hotel’s. This hotel has no shuttle, but has an ART city bus stop right in front, and the front desk sells daily passes for no profit. March 2019 the pass was 5.50.

Breakfast was included, which saves a lot of time when you're trying to get to Disneyland when they open. Also right by the freeway, making access very convenient. Rooms were mini-suites so there was plenty of room for our family of 4. One thing we found is the coffee table had a glass top that was not anchored in any way and tended to slide around. It was a big piece of glass. Feedback to the hotel was given and they wrote saying to tell them and they would remove the glass.

This year they did some renovations of their front desk/check in area. I appreciated the water stand in the lobby.

The staff at every stay has been very attentive and welcoming. The drive to Disneyland is very short (hop on I-5 and it's literally a few minutes; the line for parking usually takes longer than the drive to the park).

My room was on the sixth floor and I was able to view fireworks from Disneyland as well as the spire from the Crystal Cathedral. Another bonus is free parking.

This one was the closest to my business meeting.  The hotel has a European feel and is nicely decorated.  The room itself was lovely and spacious.  I liked that the closet was open with no doors for easier access.  The bathroom was on the small side but I suppose that comes with the European feel.  One negative is that the leather couch in the room was very stylish but quite stiff and uncomfortable to sit on.

Booked this Ayres location based on the good reviews on Tripadvisor, and the good price.  Pros - Convenient for local transit to Disney ($5 per day per adult, $2 for kids under 10 years old), breakfast, parking, internet included. Also, walking distance to the Block At Orange Mall, which is good. The staff were always helpful and friendly, and the rooms were very clean. Starbucks right next door and a Vons 2 minutes away by car. Cons - Rooms are tight, especially if you use the pull out couch. The pool and deck is almost always in the shade.

I do agree with most of your observations regarding breakfast.  It is indeed a strange setup.  The hotel has been running full house and in order to accomodate the large number (as high as 350 some mornings) of our guests for the complimentary breakfast we have to open our meeting room adjacent to the Cafe to be able to sit all guests.  The hotel will be starting a full renovation of the Cafe (Sept), and expand into what is now the meeting room.  This will give us larger more cohesive dining room in which to serve breakfast.  Toaster not working, we have also had to move the toaster  and bread selection into Cafe, away from the buffet line because guests continue to put cheese or crossaints into the toaster causing the items to burn and subsequentially set off the fire alarms in the meeting room.  The toaster the morning of your visit had just been moved outside as a small child had again tried to put cheese in the unit and started a small fire in the toaster.  It was being cleaned prior to putting back into service.  That was when we decided to move the toaster back into the Cafe permanently as there are only heat dectors and no smoke alrams.  The renovation of the dining area will provide more space for guests, give us a beautifully designed space and allow us to improve our buffet line and continue to provide a free breakast. Tip Jar - Our Guests receive a full complimentary breakfast, my staff works very hard to cook and serve the numbers of guest we have each morning for breakfast.

We always felt confused on where facilities were located and when the pool/work out room/breakfast were open. They don't change the sheets unless you put the hidden paper down to request them changed. 2. Not much variety with breakfast. It was good.  3. Pool area is very small. 4.

5 helpful votes,2 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointed,"We had read good things about the ""Ayres Inn"" however, I think we must have been reading about the Ayres Inn in Anaheim.  This hotel is in Orange, not Anaheim. We were expecting to stay closer to Disneyland but this hotel felt far away.  The rooms are very small.  The hotel elevators were tiny (4 feet by 6 feet) and didn't accomodate many people on them.  The rooms are a little noisy...not well insulated between rooms.  The worst part of our stay, however was the parking issues.  The hotel is building a new hotel behind the existing one and so the parking is pretty much nonexistent.

First let me apologize for the front desk giving you incorrect information.  The hotel does not rent out the parking lot to AT&T trucks.  The hotel is currently housing 29 AT&T repairmen from out of state who are working in the Orange County area helping the local AT&T offices.  The trucks all belong to registered and paying guests.  The AT&T office down the street is a difference division and unrelated to the AT&T group staying in the htoel.  Due to the limited parking situation the Hotel is providing complimentary valet service to our guests.  I appreciate your concern that the parking is in the construction site, but it is level, safe and away from the actual construction.  The hotel is anticipating the new 2-story parking sturcture to be open in late April.

They have had a free Disneyland shuttle provided by the hotel, which was awesome! A week before my last stay, they discontinued the shuttle. I tried to find a different hotel closer to the park without luck. The ART shuttle comes to the ayres but it's a good 30 mins till you get to Disneyland and about 30 mins from Disney back to the hotel. Far too long with whiny, tired children in tow. This was also the first time we flew instead of drove so I couldn't just drive ourselves to the park.  Another problem is the maid service. I've had this problem the last two stays. If you don't put the 'do not disturb' sign on your door, they will come in at 8am. It's pretty annoying to get woken up.

16 helpful votes,12 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Pros and Cons for Disneyland Families,"We stayed here in February for our first trip to Disneyland as a family. I booked it for three reasons: 1) Free Parking 2) Free FULL breakfast and 3) Free shuttle to and from Disneyland. When we got here we were informed that they no longer offered a free shuttle. There is a bus that stops out front that will take you to and from the park, but it will cost ya. The breakfast was OK-still fairly small, but not bad. I do think they could offer more kid type cereals, but the pancakes were appreciated. The staff was friendly, and the rooms were clean.   The ONLY reason I would not return to Ayres is the location and lack of shuttle directly to and from the park.

Yes, unfortunately the Hotel is no longer able to provide a free shuttle to Disneyland and has joined the other Hotels in the area that use the ART (Anaheim Resort Transportation) bus system.  Our website has noted this change for some time, but we are finding that anyone who books through Hotels.com, Priceline, Expedia, etc.. are still receiving incorrect information.  The Hotel contacted all of the thrid party websites when the change was made but were told that it would take each site 4-6 weeks to correct our shuttle information.  The Hotel apologizes for this and continues to contact these sites daily in an effort to correct our information in a timely manner.  The ART shuttle does run on an hourly basis during slower weeks at Disneyland but will run on the half hour during busier times such as Spring Break, Summer and Holiday periods.

We were a group of two families, with two rooms, one member with a disability. Most of the staff was extremely helpful and kind. The hotel was clean. Breakfast was fantastic---and what a HUGE money saver, especially with that many of us!! Really what it comes down to, is the only problems we had were with the shuttle. It seemed to be a daily battle to find a time when they could drive the van, which had room for the scooter that we had to transport to and from Disneyland. Most of the time there was only 1 driver so time slots were very limited. The real reason for my review is to make people aware of what happened the final day.

I also appreciated your communication with me during your stay.  As I mentioned when driving your family to Disneyland one day, the Hotel will be changing to an outside bus service to transport our guests to/from the Disneyland Resort.  This will occur in February.  The contracted service will have larger buses and lifts to accomodate our special needs guests who have scooters or wheelchairs.  As the popularity of the Ayres Inn Orange has grown over the last 2 years, especially with our Disneyland guests, we needed to improve our shuttle service to accomodate all day shuttle requests, provide larger buses for the larger number of guest going to the park and especially attend to our special needs guests.  These were all growing complaints we needed to resolve.  The Ayres Inn Orange is one of the last area Hotels to provide complimentary shuttle service; but in providing the new service guests will be charged for daily passes to use the shuttle.  This allows the Hotel to maintain our competitive rates including our breakfast, internet and parking while still providing a shuttle service to those guest who need it.   In terms of the driver you mentioned, that personnel issue has been resolved. Christine Smith General Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,1641,162

I asked the driver if I had 2 minutes to run upstairs too get my camera. He said that would be  but when I came  back he had left me. They got me on the next shuttle but had left my  wife to handle all 8 kids with the stroller by herself. Then when they got to the  park he didn't even bother helping unload the stroller.

Lobby Computer - You are correct, Adobe is a basis program and once we received your comment about Adobe not being on our lobby computer, we had it loaded and it is now available for our guests.  Thank you for the suggestion, no one had ever asked and we just didn't think about it. Cashing traveler's checks - I would like to apologize for not having funds available to cash your TA checks, we have put a couple of simple procedures in place at the Front Desk to ensure we always have enough money on hand for future guests. Shuttle - I am sorry that you were unable to book early enough to get your desired time on the shuttle and I understand the difficulty when you have small children.  Unfortunately during busy time periods there will always be time slots that fill more quickly than others whether we have a 25 person bus or a 50 person bus.  As the shuttle bus is complimentary we hope our guests understand the need to be flexible and I ask my desk to be flexible as well.  I have reminded my staff that if managers are available and a second bus needs to be added, to let us know so we can jump in to help satisfy everyone's  desired time frames.

When you did not check-out on the 31st and we saw that you were at Disneyland per the shuttle schedule, we contacted Getaway Today to make sure there was not an error on the part of the Hotel.  Getaway Today stated that you had booked the 4 night special (4th night free); and paid for the 4 night package.  When you returned to the Hotel this was explained to you and we then had to ask for payment for the 5th night.   The shuttle hours are from 7 am - 11 am and from 5 pm to 1/2 hour after closing of the park; not the hours you stated.  Should you have called the Hotel requesting a mid-day shuttle for a sick child, your request would have been immediately accommodated.  I often drive the shuttle mid-day for such requests.  Taxi fares are normally $12, but if you contact me I would be happy to reimburse you for the $20 you spent to get back to the Hotel. Concerning breakfast, I am sorry you felt you became ill due to the breakfast.  I do have to say that we served between 300 and 400 persons per day during the time period you were at the Hotel and no one else reported any ill effects from the breakfast.   Had you reported your illness to Management we would have immediately checked the kitchen and food; but again, no other guests reported any illness.   Our eggs are fresh whole eggs cooked on a grill, not microwaved eggs. I am very sorry your vacation was not what you had hoped for; I wish you had contacted me during your stay so I could have stepped in and help you immediately resolve your issues.  The Hotel did try to contact you but the phone number we had was disconnected.  We asked Getaway Today to contact you to answer questions you may have regarding your booking with them; but they had the same phone as we did.
