It is on the opposite side of the park than we usually stay and was a long walk. With a 7 year old, it took 30 minutes. You have to walk through all of Downtown Disney in order to get to the park entrance, which is too far to come back to hotel midday. There is a shuttle, but it's $3 apiece and we did not use it. You cannot see fireworks or the park at all from the hotel.  Cleanliness: This was the biggest issue. The room was pretty filthy, as was the rest of the hotel. The sheets were cleaned, but the carpet was grotesque and we found a mysterious button (??) in our bed.

We recently added an extra half hour to the breakfast time and it has helped somewhat. We have discussed adding more seating outside and making a garden type area by the pool and playground. Just remember that wherever you eat, make sure you stop by the front desk to say hi.",none,none,none,none,none,none,251,373
6 helpful votes,4 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Suite not a good value,"I stayed at this hotel on December 6-7, 2011.  I opted for the 1 bedroom suite to give us more space.  I couldn't have been more disappointed in the suite.  First, it's not really a suite--it's just regular room with a very small room attached to it. The extra room has a pull-out couch and a coffee table and that's it.  It has A/C but doesn't have heat.  The room was not that clean--the carpets were pretty dirty and the linens didn't seem all that clean either.   I slept on the pull-out couch and it was not comfortable.  It's probably the cheapest and most uncomfortable pull-out bed I've ever slept on.  The manager at the front desk was friendly and the breakfast was average.  They had eggs and sausage that we stuck between toast to make a sandwich.  They had 3 cereal choices,",December 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,252,373

If you want a comfortable room, within walking distance, this will be fine. When we first opened the door, there was a strong perfumey smell which gave way to an old smell as the week went on. The room was small, but it had a fridge and microwave and comfortable beds.  The bathroom counter is very small and behind the door to the bathroom door so a little inconvenient. The courtyard was lovely and the breakfast was good. The pool looked lovely but the water was cold.  Only used it for a few minutes one afternoon as it was so cold. The people at the desk were lovely and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is not fussy! We had a great deal and would stay here again for",October 2011,none,none,"Thank you for your comments.  I am sorry that you experienced a musty smell in the room.  We have recently had the carpets cleaned and am sure that the rooms are more pleasant now. As for the pool, we adjusted the temperature a few degrees and we now have a crowd almost every night  swimming!  We look forward to seeing you on your next trip.",none,none,none,none,none,none,253,373

Nice little touches - glowing light switches, in-room safe, pretty fan-folded towels, and sturdy work desk. Good breakfast assortment and quantity.   I would have been very pleased with my stay if it wasn't for a string of problems - broken coffee maker, broken shower curtain bar (curtain sagging, touching the floor), and broken Internet. None of these problems were initially resolved after contacting the front desk, until I took it up with a manager on my 4th day there.   The Internet outage was really bad because I was on business, and different front desk staff denied there were Internet problems for three days. Finally, the 4th day, a new front desk guy admitted there were persistent issues, and the",September 2011,none,none,What you experienced dealing with the front desk was unacceptable. I have changed the way information is shared among our employees and this will not happen again. We now have new owners who will make sure these problems are dealt with immediately. We hope you give us another chance to show you all of our improvements.,none,none,none,none,none,none,254,373
