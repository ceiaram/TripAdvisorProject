Instead of fetching take-out and a bottle of wine at the grocery store - after my 4 hour drive - Brandon suggested the option of just walking a few steps to the right and let Will take care of my food beverage for the evening. BINGO! Like Brandon, Will’s presence  was 5-star. I had one of the best reds, thanks to Will’s suggestion of a Rodney Strong blend, and the carnitas nachos were delicious (and ample), as well.
