Loved having enough beds for everyone. Room seemed clean. Nice hot water in the shower. Used the mini fridge in The room. Room also has microwave and single cup coffee maker. (Not keurig brand) we didn't use that. The lobby has a coffee machine with creamer that we used each morning instead. Had a late arrival. Someone was there at the front desk. Check in and out was easy.  Only thing that I could add to the room is some kind of curtain or divider to block the light from the sink bathroom area to the rest of the room.

We've stayed at other hotels where walking to the park and back is anywhere from 15-25 minutes, on top of being in the parks all day.  This place has a great location!  2.  Price.

A 5 minute walk gets you to the front gate. There are plenty of choices for eating out, as long as you like Denny's (in front of the hotel) MacDonalds (100m north) and the like. The free continental breakfast was pretty good - self-service bagels, danish, coffee, etc.  Rooms are well equipped and staff were very courteous, allowing us to use their car park for the full day, before we checked in. On the down-side, the air-con units were noisy and the swimming pool is overlooked by the car park. But for the price, you can't really complain.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,751,148
99 helpful votes,15 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Location & Value,"Our family had five rooms and chose Del Sol for its reviews. They were all accurate. It has the best location and great value. The staff is very friendly and service-oriented. Breakfast consisted of pastries, bread for toast, dry cereal, milk, orange juice, coffee, tea, and oranges. Who needs more?!? Most of our five rooms had decent carpet; ours was badly stained. Management acknowledged that they will be re-carpeting the property soon. My only negative comment is the pool can get pretty noisy with all the kids and the sound permeates the complex. The bed was nice and firm. The shower had great pressure and drainage. The AC worked fine. I would definitely stay here again.",March 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,752,148
11 helpful votes,66 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location!,"Read the reviews posted and agreed with most of them. Stayed there during mid of Mar 04. We arrived early (7am) and they allowed us to check into our room so that we can have a bath to freshen up and offer us the breakfast for that morn, at no costs. The room was clean and the staff were courteous and helpful throughout the stay. Minus point would be the thin walls, where we can hear kids fighting and crying from our neighbours.  One last thing, if you are arranging for an airport shuttle pickup, tell Del Sol that NOT to use Prime Shuttle. The shuttle was AT LEAST 45 mins LATE and the driver wasn't aplogetic when he arrived and even tried to EXHORT $40 from us for his service!!!! and its written on the shuttle that ""We On Time, Or you don't pay!"" So please remember request NOT",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,753,148
11 helpful votes,5 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location,"After reading the other reviews, I had to try it. Stayed here early March '04. All other reviews were accurate. Great location: across the street from Disney, and a short 10-15 minute walk to the Convention Center. Clean/newer rooms, only noise was from all the kids having fun.  Free parking for guests. It's not a 5 Star hotel, but it very nice and great location for the price you pay. Local food within walking distance, just to name a few...Dennys, IHOP, McDonalds, Tony Roma's, and all the restaurants at Disney Downtown (free admission). Have fun!",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,754,148

40 helpful votes,41 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Now Del Sol Inn,"Can't beat the value. Stayed here over MLK weekend and thought it was the best value overall for a Disney trip. When you consider parking at Disney is $8/day and my $49 room includes parking this really is a great value. Have 2 little kids and it was easy to walk back and forth.  Have stayed at Paradise Pier and disney hotel but I find this to be more convenient since I had a first floor room and didn't need to unpack stroller filled with goodies. Keep your expectations to motel level and you will not be disapointed. Pros - great location, price, refrigerator, microwave. Cons - flat pillows, thin walls.  P.S stay away from Moms restaurant next door",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,756,148
4 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,New Name Del Sol Inn,"We were just there from Dec 21-23.  We had 3 rooms and they kept us side by side.  The rooms are clean, no frill but large.  All 8 of us had fun talking and watching TV together in one room in the evening.  Location is the key here.  Just a short walk to Disneyland.  The breakfast was better than many in the area and everything was clean.  The beds were a little hard.  Would recommend this to anyone on a budget and wants a good clean, friendly place to stay.  We have tried others and would definitely stay here again.  Great rates on the internet.  Also loved the laundry facilities on site.",December 2003,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,757,148

The beds were comfortable the rooms clean and very large! Would recommend especially if needing a crib or rollaway space! We had a two Q room, microwave, fridge, safe (which they didn't charge us to use) Disney channel and HBO. Pool/Spa were small but clean. Location was super! Right across the street to Disneyland main gate. Rate we found on their website was $45 per night! Reception staff was courteous and helpful. Continental breakfast was standard: fruit, pastries, bread for toast, cheerios, cornflakes, milk, 2 kinds of juice, coffee and tea.
