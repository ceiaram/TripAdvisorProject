They have a beautiful well maintained dog park a basketball court and check in was easy and friendly. The room was clean except for the window screen which was filthy any I'm sure that was in hopes of covering the fact that the roof outside our window was where they throw all there recyclables so it's piled with bags of cans and filthy cardboard boxes. Plus the hall outside our door is piled with extra mattresses makes but at least they are new.  Lol so on day two they decided to clean out there storage shed and sit right in front of the stairs to do it so you have to weave around people and crap to get up and down the stairs So fun so ok the room is clean the people are friendly in somewhat clueless about proper storage,December 2014,none,Traveled as a couple,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,478
