I have tried other Best Western Plus hotels in the area but Newport-Mesa Inn is the best in service and quality, a true plus hotel.  The good: *Location - near OC county fairgrounds, walking distance to Jack in the Box, AM/PM, Subway, Starbucks, sushi restaurant, etc. *Room size - the rooms are huge, plenty of space for business & family trips. *Rooms are very clean. *Room amenities - room safe, coffee maker, iron & iron board, some rooms have dual sinks and some a wet bar area. *Decor - modern, both room & bathroom are well decorated. *Complimentary basket - bottle waters, fruit, cereal/snack bar. *Flat screen television - good size",May 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,583,185

It was well worth the price when you figure in the breakfast.  It wasn't expensive but with the breakfast I saved about $40 more dollars at least. I would definitely go back here again.  The rooms were average. The usual for this price chain.  But the staff was friendly.  And the location was great. You could just jump on the 55.  The OC Swap Meet is right across the highway. This was also a fantastic thing to do.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,667,185
22 helpful votes,18 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Comfortable,"I have stayed at the BW Newport Mesa Inn in Costa Mesa 4 times, the last time February 5. All of the rooms that I stayed in were clean & large.  This hotel provides 24 hour coffee, a very decent Free breakfast (eggs, bacon,potatoes, bakery products, cereal, juices, coffee & tea), Free wireless internet access, pool, spa, sauna and exercise room. The staff is very helpful and nice. Housekeeping comes early.          The only two complaints that I have about this hotel is that the wireless signal is not strong enough to be useful from every room in the hotel (even with the hotels equipment) and (greedy me) I would like a few more tv channels. On the whole I prefer it to the Comfort Inn down the street.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,668,185

14 helpful votes,6 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointed,"I booked 10 nights at this hotel (sight unseen).  I had never been to CA before, so I researched many hotels before settling on this one, as I got the lowest price out of many others in the area.  I referred to the BW website as well as the trip advisor reviews (all quite favorable) to assist me with my decision.  I arrived at the hotel with my boyfriend on 6-10-04 and we were very disappointed.  The hotel does not look nearly as nice as it does on the web pictures.  I asked the girl at the desk if we could see the room before deciding to stay for a long duration.  She said it would be no problem and gave us the key.  I was told that I would get a ""pool view"" (which there doesn't seem to be any), and instead the room was on the first floor down the hall from the lobby (the",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,671,185

During the day I was able to work from the room with the DSL connection while my wife shopped at the nearby South Coast Plaza. There is a very nice Swap-Meet that takes place right across the hotel on Sat. and Sun.

none,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Best Western Newport Mesa Inn,"We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds and it was roomy enough for 3 adults, a toddler and an infant.  We didn't spend much time in our room but the motel was comfortable enough and the staff friendly enough. The area seemed safe.  Our room was conveniently located next to the stairs and the laundry room. If you need an elevator, request a room near the lobby. There was even an internet connected computer that guests were allowed to use. The complimentary breakfast was okay. No eggs and bacon here just your toast, cereal, and fruit. Although it is located next to a freeway, we couldn't hear the cars.  A great deal and a great place to stay if you won't be in your room much and if atmosphere isn't important.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,675,185
