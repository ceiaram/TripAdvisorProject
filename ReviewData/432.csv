But I haven't been her in many years. I'm happy to see the many improvements. Asphalt  roads vs dirt throughouts,water at many of the sites, plenty of trash dumpers, completely remodeled restrooms with showers. It still has all the large oak trees. and the drive through Live Oak Canyon hasn't changed a bit. and it is still dry camping. No electrical or sewer hookups. We really enjoyed our stay there. It is very close to town and all the stores and restaurants. The hiking and horseback riding. But still out in the wilderness. So you still have to be aware of the wildlife. Including mountain lions.

You can only run your generator from 8am-8pm, but even then you feel like your annoying your neighbors in their tents so we tried to keep it off as much as possible. The “community water spigot” was too far away for our hose. So of course with no hookups, no internet or antenna TV as well.  We stayed one night and went to Orangeland RV Park.

When we got there my 19' trailer fit tight but even worse there was a huge California Oak right where my awning was going to be when I pulled it out. So our tent camping friends in 69 said it would be better to park on their site since they weren't using the asphalt portion. Sites are level for the most part. It was a whole story at the check-in to tell them we were just parking in two different sites. I guess they've had problems with that in the past. I offered to have both of us go to the front to switch parking passes. They were fine with it and let us do our thing for the weekend.

We were given a refund on our camping fees when I injured my back and we had to leave 2 days early. It does get very hot here in the summer.

This park is a year-round facility but is better enjoyed in the off-peak periods. It is best to avoid the hot and crowded months of June, July, and August.

2 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Camping Fun,"Stayed one night in March 2016  Spots are very spacious, each with a fire pit, picnic table and most have a water spout.   Most spots have some sort of shade or tree around.  Restrooms are pretty clean and the showers have warm water.   We stayed during the week and had no neighbors and the campground itself was quiet, though as many others point out you will hear the traffic from the road.    When you arrive at the park, you need to park and check in at the little ranger station.  It's fairly quick if you have online reservations.  The staff was friendly.    Coming and going is a little pain because they do have a parking gate that has to be opened each time.

Showers and bathrooms fairly close to evert spot. There are water spigots around the park but not everywhere. Dog friendly as well. I would definitely recommend this park. The only noise we dealt with was the occasional motorcycle brigade, scouts and kids having fun and such, and the tree trimmers in the week (which I'm sure is only something one would experience if they happen to schedule during tree trimming week). All in all a very good stay and good accommodations, even with a schedule/spot conflict. - *TIP: Book weekends as far in advance as possible to avoid having to move around. - ~ABC",October 2014,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,13,432

We loved that you felt out in the middle of no where but there were conveniences near by if necessary. The facilities were clean and close by. Our site had plenty of space between us and our neighbor. We had a nice fire ring and picnic table. There was plenty of wilderness to walk through just on the other side of our camp.

The campsite is very nice, bathrooms have flushing toilets and were well maintained. There were also showers which seemed clean and well maintained. There was plenty of tree coverage in the camping area which was nice when the days were hot. Nights in October are super cold so bring lots of extra blankets. There is a BBQ, fire pit and plenty of tables.   Few downfalls: noticed some of the individual campsites didn't have any shade so bringing an EZ Up would be recommended.
