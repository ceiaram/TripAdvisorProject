none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disgusting and rude!,"This place was cheap. They gave me room on noisy street I asked to swap and they said they couldn’t. The service was HORRIBLE. CASH DEPOSIT ONLY! I do NOT RECOMMEND. Front desk managers are rude and disrespectful. I walked around to get ice (never been here)and they called my room and said was suspicious and called cops and asked me to leave?! Spend your money elsewhere!!! DO NOT COME HERE AREA IS SKETCHY, THE STAFF MANAGERS ARE SHADY!!!!",July 2022,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,503
1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,AVOID !!,"We booked for two nights. Once we checked in and saw the room we cancelled the 2nd night. Dirty, no blankets (only bedspread) thin scratchy pillows, slimy floor. I went immediately to the office and cancelled the next days reservation. They said fine and that would be done when I checked out. The next day they said I would have to call booking.com to get refund. Booking .com said to get it from the hotel. When I called the hotel they said no refunds. DISHONEST crooks!",February 2020,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,503
73 helpful votes,84 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great rooms, cheap and affordable",The rooms and toilets were spacious and clean. The manager there were kind enough to allow early check in and were very accommodating. The housekeeping did a good job. Location is great- Disney is only 10 mins drive from here.

4 helpful votes,9 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nope,"We thought the room looked clean until the next morning when baby roaches started coming out everywhere. We must have killed at least 7. May have been the nice old permanent resident living in the room next to ours. Or the one a couple doors down. Or the ones below us. Told the desk guy but as long as he got his money he didn’t seem to care and didn’t apologize either. And the orange, apple, and box of cereal (with no milk) was a hilarious “complimentary breakfast”. They came in and made our beds and took the dirty towels but didn’t leave clean ones. Good thing we brought our own. The floor turned our feet black, but after seeing the roaches we wore shoes anyway.",August 2018,none,Traveled with friends,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,503
none,3 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Just for sleeping,My family and I did last minute booking and found this. It was great just to rest at night after all we we're not there through out the day. For smokers it's good cause they let you do it in the rooms. So yes it's great for just sleeping.

1 helpful vote,4 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,One night.,We wanted to do an early check in but we weren't able to because the room wasn't clean. But check in was fast. The bed was comfy and the room spacious. The water ran hot. The floor felt a bit slimy and soft like a carpet was under it. The area was quiet enough. If needed to we would stay there again.,August 2017,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,6,503

7 helpful votes,42 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Not a good family stay,"Room is ok, but its not the most family-friendly stay of the area. I would recommend to invest a couple of bucks in a hotel closer to the theme parks for that matter. Also the parking lot looks sketchy as many of the guests there use the rooms a permanent stay.",June 2016,none,Traveled with friends,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,8,503
54 helpful votes,50 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Last minute booking,"Not bad for a little stay I reckon for theme parks etc. It's under new management it said. Lady at the front desk was nice and friendly.  Assigned a parking spot, there aren't many so probably good to arrive close after check in. Room was ok for a cheap stay. Smelt of cigarette smoke but we could deal with it for a night. Outdated bathroom but works. Don't rely on the wifi, it's slow and painful.! Can be noisy at times as it seems a lot of rooms have people living in the permanently..",August 2015,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,9,503

15 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst experience I have ever had at a hotel.,Since my last review got scrubbed I will just state the facts. The parking lot is full because 1/3 of the spaces are taken by derelict cars. The room stank like cat pee and was infested with roaches. The manager got angry at us for complaining about the bugs. She kicked us out and refused to refund us for the night we didn't stay there. There were crack heads hanging out in the hallways.  This place is a mess. Hopefully our complaints to the health department will cause this place to be shutdown.,June 2014,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,11,503
5 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Never again would I stay here.,"So, I stayed at the Anaheim National Inn for two nights. I decided to stay here because it seemed affordable and fairly close to Disneyland. I regret staying here. I booked a ""two-queen suite."" What I got was practically a standard room with a wall in the middle. Also, this two queen room actually consisted of one queen bed and one full bed. The bathroom door opened into the end of the bed. And on our last morning, we were woken up by jack hammers outside our window... When I tried to talk to the manager about it all, she yelled at me and told me I was lying about the bed size.

We stayed here for over a month while our house was being remodeled. There are laundry machines on property which is nice you don't have to leave. Resturants very close walking distance.

8 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,drug infested motel,"We paid $718 for 10 days for three adults in a room with two king beds. There are back cracks all over the sink. A couple of holes on the bath surround. The tub is dirty. The exhaust fan didn't work. The room smelled like badly after one of us used the washroom. We requested three times and it took four days to have it fixed. I don’t think that the motel would minimum health requirements.     This motel is a mainly monthly renting place for locals. A relative of mine told us that this is a drug infested place and unsafe for tourists.   I've been a frequent traveler during the last 50 years in many third world countries. This is the worst motel that I have even stayed so far.   I regret that booked the motel with the Booking.com for 10 days.

3 helpful votes,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great value for the price,"I chose this hotel because they had an incredibly inexpensive weekend rate, and was prepared for it to be bad. Imagine my surprise when I found that my room had just been remodeled, and had brand new carpeting, furniture, mattress, bedding, etc. I noticed there were no hangers, no doubt because of the recentness of the remodel, so in the morning I asked if there were any hangers. By that evening brand new wooden hangers had been installed. I had a brand new microwave, fridge, and coffee maker, as well as desk, big desk chair, comfy arm chair, and small table. Even the little shampoo was nice. With the weekly rate I got maid service every 2 or 3 days, and each time I got all clean towels, and clean sheets, unlike the previous reviewer.

4 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Waste of my money.,"My husband and I stayed here for a week and the rooms weren't very nice to start with. The room smelt terrible. Everyday they just picked the dirty towels up off of the floor, fold them up and hang them back up. The sheets were never changed. When we complained to the owner she yelled at us. She also told us that she took pictures of our clothes that we left in the room on the floor by accident. The service was terrible.",August 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,16,503
