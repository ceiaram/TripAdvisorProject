We were staying a few days in the area so we decided that for a few dollars more we would get the room that included a kitchenette. There were NO pots, no pans, no eating utensils, no coffee pot, no cups or glasses,,, nothing that you would expect in a kitchenette. When I talked to the front desk, they said we haven't had those things for years. I complained that the room should be discounted to the normal room price.

Guy at the desk was a little cold and grumpy, especially when I rang the bell at 1 am because there wasn't a SINGLE parking spot in the entire lot for us.  Parking lot of idiotic, one way in and had to back the entire way out if it was full.  Not well designed at all.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible,This motel is falsely advertised I didn’t feel safe from the area and the set up. Not to mention I feel like my room door was not secure. I also felt like something was crawling on me all night so I didn’t hardly sleep. The bed was small and hard and the room was ridiculously small. I reserved two beds when I got there they told me they only had one room left with one bed. The hotel just looks grimey and I safe.

I can't confirm but it looked like some mold buildup in the corners of the bath. The shower water stream was so thin and powerful that it felt like pins and needles on the body.The kitchenette(which we had to pay more for) had no pots, no pans, no silverware, etc... just a 2 burner countertop(I believe that there is an assumption some are provided). Unfortunately, we didn't notice most of this until the morning after we arrived. There was no coffee pot or no iron. There was a hair dryer,,, thats it!

Quiet area as it is located around a residential block, hidden from the busy street.  Basic needs are provided.  Just wished the front desk would be a little bit more friendly.

The administrators do nothing to maintain order, the manager goes out to see but does not take any action for the peace of the other guests. Guests smoking on the doors of the rooms. bad smell in the rooms. There is no isolation between rooms, conversations are heard from the room next door. The cleaning staff makes too much noise in the mornings when cleaning, they scream, they sing, it's terrible.

Breakfast consisted of commercial chocolate muffins coffee and apples on the weekend and coffee during the week.  Room service was slow to begin but once it began, it was good.  Everything worked fine.  WIFI did not work real well inside the room but reception was better outside. An iron was available; but no ironing boards were available.  Be prepared to buy some items for breakfast or eat out.   Our room had a refrigerator and microwave; and my understanding is that all rooms have these.
