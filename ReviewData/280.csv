The overall Inn layout is the problem to me as you can hear people in adjoining rooms or if your on the first floor, the footsteps of those above you.    I'm probably being a little picky but I don't hear this in other Marriott hotels, Courtyards or Fairfield Inns?

Next to a Chruch, an excellant playground and what more just 15 miles for Disneyland.   A true ""Value for money"". The hotel also provides free drop-pickup facility in 10 miles radius.

I've never seen so many liquor stores within one area!  It seemed to be okay though. We were attending an event at the Orange County Fairgrounds which was about 2.5 miles from the hotel and we drove there as we did the Stater Bros grocery store at Fairview and Baker. Also, anything at all else we needed could be found off of Bristol road, about 2.5 miles as well: Mall, Trader Joes, Target etc. The hotel is also very close to the freeway and very close to John Wayne Airport.  Room: The room was a strange layout but again served our purposes for the week. It had one king bed and a the sofa bed which our daughter used.

Oh well, not a real big deal.  There is a laundry room that is open 24 hours & came in handy.  The laundry area was clean, as were the washers & dryers.

Residence Inn in Costa Mesa may not be very new but the room we had was clean and spacious with 1 king bedrm downstairs and a queen bed upstairs, loft style, and a pull out sofa. If you have young kids, there's an area where they can run and play plus a pool and even basketball court which doubles as a mini tennis court. I found the hotel property a bit tight though-- the pool is right next to the court.

I stay at Residence Inns often when traveling on business, and usually encounter similar travelers.  With the vacation season, I was suprised to see the amount of families staying here.  But is is a reasonably short drive  to Disneyland, beaches, LA.  It is a hop skip & a jump to John Wayne Airport, but not so near as to be bothered by planes.  It is a typical RI, clean, spacious, not the most modern.  I took a 2nd floor room that was on the highway side.  However, I wasn't bothered by any highway noise.  Maybe it;s because on 2nd floor suites, the AC is in closet inside the suite, creating a white nouse affect.    In any case, it was very clean, the grounds were well maintained.

It turned out to be handy to me. *Dining Breakfast (complimentary) is fairly good, with hot oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausages, iron waffles, yogurts, assorted cereals, fruits, etc. The complimentary dinner offered from Mon-Thu (5-7) is also good.

We had a party of 5 adults and 2 small children so we booked the Penthouse suite.  Check-in was fine and the rate that we got on the hotels website was acceptable at $149.    We walked into our penthouse and proceeded to unload our car.  There are not elevators, so this took a while.  I left my two preschoolers in the room with their uncle.  The penthouse is a loft with the bed directly against the half wall in the upstairs bedroom.  My two kids stood on the bed to look over and see what was beneath them and they almost fell off.  They would have been killed had their uncle not been right there to grab their legs.  I knew that this room was not going to work for us.

The hotel offers King beds in all studios with a full size sofa-bed as well. Hotel gave me a choice of ground level or 2nd floor and recognized elite status with Marriott with rooms located poolside. Very well maintained property. Excellent varried breakfast buffet with many items that could be easily taken back to the room or enjoyed in the lobby seating area.   No problem at all when asking for a 13:30 late check-out to be able to enjoy the area. Upon asking for late check-out receptionist produced a map to Newport Beach and displayed great service attitude which I had already experienced with all other contact with hotel staff.,September 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,242,280
