It is the absolute center of town, had the sweetest staff who appeared to authentically want to help you have a great vacation.... and we got cookies and milk every night!  Who could ask for more!  Seriously the room was a Four Seasons quality and if you can afford it, I recommend the Ocean View Suite.

The staff were friendly and the service was great. The view was fantastic and we had a large balcony overlooking the pier. There is a convenience store below which is handy, and plenty of great restaurants around with happy hour specials. The only thing I'll say is that san clemente is expensive. The food and drink is expensive in the area. The other thing is the train. It can be noisy and runs by often with horns blaring and the crossing dinging. Very noisy!

How can you go wrong with the balcony facing the beach. Sunsets every night were spectacular. We enjoyed walking the Pier, watching the surfers from our balcony, and hiking the beach trail.  Beds were very comfortable and the unit was well decorated. The bathroom and kitchen are out dated but who cares when you have this location. Easy walk up the street to amazing restaurants and shopping. Sundays there is a farmer market too.

Over the years Villa Del Mar has increasingly raised its prices .  We last paid 325 a night.  We asked for two beds and got one incredibly uncomfortable queen and one futon that they called "" your second bed ""  We then requested an additional cot expecting what one would expect - something with a thin mattress.  Instead we received a ""cot"" that my husband said you could get at Wallmart for twenty dollars - no mattress just a thin piece of foam.

We strive to provide a relaxing beach environment to all who stay with us.  Unfortunately, there are certainly external factors that we can't control. I would like to point out that we do not advertise a/c in units and, as a matter of fact, it's not really necessary for beach accommodations as the wonderful sea breezes float in through our balcony doors and large screened sliders, such as the one in Suite #4. To add to the breeze, there are 3 ceiling fans in this suite and plenty of windows to open and allow the cool beach air to ventilate your suite.  We have installed brand new High Definition Cox cable boxes in all of our suites to maximize the viewing pleasure of our guests. Every suite is carpeted throughout, with the exception of hallways and bathrooms. We have outfitted every suite with brand new Serta sleeper mattresses.  Our goal is for all guests to feel at home on the beach, and while we can't please everyone's tastes every time, we are working hard every day to make our Villa suites better and better. It is always a pleasure to welcome back any one of the hundreds of repeat guests we've had through the years and hear from them what a special place in their memories we hold.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,8,411

We stayed in room 5 VDM this time (8 last time).  Room was similar.  I don't care that the motif is outdated and somewhat dirty...it's a beach trip.  However, we stayed a week later in the season than last year and the price went up dramatically.  And for almost $300/night, it was harder to swallow the less than impressive room.  The train doesn't really bother me.  But it did get ""stuck"" at 6am and was ringing for almost 30 min.  Not fun.  I really think this room with a window directly on the outside of the unit, made it louder.  With all this said, I wouldn't even mind all this, IF the staff displayed good customer service.
