Also Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, etc, are all close by. The front desk employees are all really nice. The rooms are okay,  no ""wow"" factor. A couple of minor complaints, wash cloths were not in our bathroom, had to ask the front desk for some. 2 out of 3 soap/shampoo dispensers were empty. For the breakfast, it is always nice when a hotel offers this, but avoid the scrambled eggs and potatoes, they are disgusting.

Therefore, this year we decided to go a little further out and we found this hotel. We are glad we did.   What we saved on hotel rates and hotel parking fees made up for the slight drive and parking fees at Disney.

After researching hotels near the park in Anaheim, the accomodations were outrageously expensive, and not so nice.  We decided on Best Western Plus in Placienta.  The check-in process was fast, the room was extremely nice, newly renovated.  42"" Flat Screen, Coffee Maker with free Coffee, Refrigerator, and the Bed was very comfortable.  The housekeepers were extremely nice, and made our stay peaceful.  We had no issues, other than the WIFI didn't allow us to upload pictures to Twitter or Facebook.

This was our second stay at this hotel and we came back because of the comfortable bed. The room itself is OK, nothing special but is maintained well. The only complaint is that all the rooms have a musty smell to them. But the air worked well, mini fridge cooled really well,  & free high speed internet in the room with good signal strength.

We were told that the room was big enough for all of us (family of four), but we were VERY cramped!!!  The room was average with a dresser, desk with two chairs, two queen sized beds, closet, television, and bathroom... nothing extra and nothing short.  Not much else to say but that this was extremely average...  If you are used to staying at Holiday Inn Express hotels, the breakfast was average as well - nothing out of the ordinary.    Word of caution, though.  If you are attracted to this hotel because of its title, ""Holiday Inn Express Placentia - Disneyland Park Area,"" don't be fooled.

Didn't get the tip that we left in the room! The free breakfast was ok. But there's a Denny's right across if you want heavy breakfast. Very convenient place to stay in. Went to Disney for 2 days(just a short drive from this hotel about 6 miles). Bed was great! Only negative here was there's no refrigerator(needed it for storage of my kid's milk). Parking was good. Shower was great. Overall, we had an awesome stay. Will gladly stay here again next time!   P.S.

The bed was great...supportive without being hard.  The rooms were a decent size and the free wireless internet was great.  We also love the breakfast...traditional Holiday Inn Express breakfast with yummy cinnamon rolls, etc.  There is also a Denny's practically attached to the hotel, so you can easily get a full breakfast if you'd like.

Everything that is written describes the hotel exactly and my hotel stay. My boyfriend and I decided to stay here for a short weekend getaway, we got a suite with a jacuzzi. We've stayed at holiday inn express before and so we were not surprised when it was exactly like the others, fantastic!   Our room was clean, well supplied and the jacuzzi was exactly as shown in their pictures. The bed was so comfortable that we would've slept in and skipped our breakfast but decided to take advantage of it.

We weren't expecting much because of its rating, just a clean, simple place to stay at.  I don't know if all of the Holiday Inn Express hotels were a part of this, but it looked like they revamped their image and attempted to be more like a Westin in terms of presentation, without the Westin price tag.  It was great!  The bedding not only looked great, but was nice to sleep in.  They gave us each two pillows - a firm and a soft one for each person to choose from.  (The pillows were labeled too!)  How cool is that?  Oh, and a couple of mints on the bed each morning to sweeten it.  :)  The bath towels were thick and nice.  The toiletries were displayed nicely as well.

We weren't as close to Disneyland as we would have liked, but it only took maybe 15 minutes to get to the park.

We had booked the room through Priceline, so we weren't exactly sure what we would end up with. What a wonderful surprise! Nice clean, spacious room. Friendly, helpful staff. Great breakfast. Plenty of parking. Nice pool and spa but two nearby trees were loosing their leaves. However, they ran out of ice (two machines for the entire hotel obviously aren't enough). Not close to Disneyland, but there is easy freeway access. It took us about 7 min. to get to the park. The ice situation kept them from getting an excellent rating from me, but I would definitely stay there again.  David from Mesa, AZ",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,583,200
