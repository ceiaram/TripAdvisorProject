Also, towels were always provided in abundance and since such a big issue has been made of the same I would like to mention that a lot of the towels issued to your room went missing. As I mentioned to your husband, you may not take property from the Hotel out for any reason and there was never even a courtesy notice of the same. The night auditor called just once to your room because he suspected additional people entering your room late at night.

Two problems:  1) The door to the room isn`t fully insulated and so you can very clearly hear the slamming doors of the cars parking in the lot so that kept waking me up at night.   2) The t.v. is bolted to the wall and so it`s uncomfortable to look at.  I wish these motels wouldn`t do this.   Otherwise, an okay place, probably a lot better than others.",February 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,222,353

I chose Twin Palms because a pre-room check showed it to be very clean. The owners, including friendly Nick, live on the property in the middle of the complex in a nice house that gives a homey feel to the place . . . right across the street is Kimmie's breakfast restaurant & you can walk down the street to a local burger joint, a park, and a little bit further to Downtown Brea and the brand new Farrel's Ice Cream Parlor. The area is nice and safe, and though it's about 30 minutes from Disneyland, you will save a lot of money and be in a peaceful yet conveniently located spot. I'd stay here again.",December 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,223,353
1 helpful vote,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clean rooms, surprisingly quiet","Having looked for cheaper places to stay, we came up on Twin Palms. I've been surprised from the start - the price, the courteous manager and then the room itself. They've been very well maintained and very clean. Most of all it was surprisingly quiet despite being located on a high traffic road. Very happy with the place and would definitely recommend to anyone. Thank you.",November 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,224,353

4 helpful votes,4 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A Gem In The Rough,"My fiance and I have stayed there a number of times because of the price and the location. We initially went there because of a bad experience with The Big A motel in Orange..<I wrote a review on them here>. I say a gem in the rough because they are remodeling and doing a fantastic job. It is a motel and not the Ritz-Carlton but the folks who run it are really nice, very attentive, and it is in a great location on the Fullerton/Brea border. Also, the prices are reasonable and since i love to cook, they have some kitchen units. If you are staying for a week on business or leisure and you don't have the bankroll of a sheik, I totally recommend this place. Plus, as a muscian, Guitar Center was three blocks away and a great pastrami sandwich place is less than two blocks away.",January 2010,none,none,"Hi James, We would like to send our heartfelt thanks for writing this wonderful review of our establishment.
