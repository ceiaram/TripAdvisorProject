The owner was extremely welcoming, and provided everything I needed without being overly present, as can sometimes be the case with B and B's. I had a great night's sleep, and there were extra travel-sized products in the bathroom, which was really helpful. I had breakfast on the run the next morning, which was perfect, and then was able to return midday to do some more work online before my departure. Parking is easy, and it's no more than a 3 minute drive to the university. Highly recommended, and seemed like a far better option than some of the chain hotels I had looked at that seemed to cater to Disneylanders.",October 2012,none,Traveled on business,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,455

Although some of the furniture are a little bit run down and the hostess has her days, but these are some details, it was nice ! Nice garden too and location really nice close to the heart of the old town of Orange.",September 2011,none,Traveled with family,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,2,455
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We were married here and came back for 10th Anniversary - Wonderful!,"We both agree we could not have had a more perfect wedding and B&B experience than at the French Inn.  We always wanted to return and in May we did.  We didn't expect help with our light luggage but we got it, and every other courtesy.  Part of our total enjoyment was visiting again with Sarah and having the great realization that not only is her Inn restful, beautiful,  and quiet, but she is the epitome of loveliness and efficiency.  (This we witnessed even during a few stressful challenges at the wedding).  Our breakfast was delicious.  We so enjoyed two hours of walking around Old Towne Orange before our requested  9:00 am breakfast.  Gorgeous fresh flowers graced the lovely home (even in our bathroom) and the trees on the estate are terrific.  We hopefully will return again,",May 2011,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,455
169 helpful votes,948 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A real place in a famously plastic area,"This is a great ‘real’ place to stay if you just can’t take another stay in plastic corporate lodging.  Like staying at Grandmothers home, if Grandmother happens to own a great old Edwardian home.  They have events here, mostly weddings, and there is some noise (as there is everywhere in Orange County) but the grounds are lovely, the bed comfortable, I stayed in a room with swell old pink tile fixtures from another time.  Don’t worry you get your cable and it is convenient to Old Town Orange and the rest of the Orange Country attractions.  Breakfast is well-prepared and you will find your host Sarah charming.  One caveat, you will hear the train whistles, so be prepared for that if you are a country dweller, if you hale from the city you won’t notice a thing.",March 2010,none,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,4,455
1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A little bit of paradise,"The French Estate, often referred to as The French Inn, was a terrific place to stay.  I needed a room as I was in from out of town for a lavish Christmas party at an old friend's home.  I prefer the Bed & Breakfast atmosphere to a local hotel for many reasons... one being the personalized service and terrific breakfasts.  The French Estate more than exceeded my expectations.  Sarah, the proprietor, was both charming and accommodating.  In fact, I ended up inviting her to the Christmas party.  The location could not have been better and the off street parking was a real plus.  Not being near a main street made for very quiet, restful, sleep... something very important to me.  I have traveled throughout Europe, New Zealand, etc., and I would rank The French Estate as comparable",December 2009,none,Traveled solo,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,455
