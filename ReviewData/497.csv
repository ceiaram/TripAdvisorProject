Today (17 days before my arrival there) they simply sent me a message saying they had to cancel my reservation! Now I have to find a new place to stay and it's almost everything booked.  Of course now I don't want to stay there in this place, because they are obviously non reliable people. However, when I check on booking.com, my reservation is still there! And I can't cancel it, otherwise I will be charged for it. I hope they cancel it as soon as possible, because I don't want to have even more headache that I already had with this place.  TERRIBLE PLACE, DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO BOOK IT!!!",February 2019,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,497
