29 helpful votes,56 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,DO NOT BOOK HERE,"This place is the most disgusting heap I've ever seen/smelled, let alone stayed at. I would have left directly after walking into the room if I hadn't been so tired to the point of feeling like I could fall asleep at the wheel. (This place is indeed better than risking a serious auto accident or death.) We literally considered sleeping in our van in the parking lot instead. We just got between the sheets (which seemed somewhat clean other than one very long black hair) and tried not to touch anything else in the room (Including the stained, nasty bed-spread). Good thing the lights were so dark... I shutter to think what you could see if there was proper lighting! The maroon carpet was dirty, damp, moldy and coming off the floor at parts.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,WORST PLACE EVER!!!,"Let me begin by saying you REALLY don't want to touch the floors with your bare feet!! The wall has mold on it from the 1970s ""a/c"" unit that is leaking water inside the room. There is virtually no lighting in the room whether it's because the light just doesn't work or the bulbs are so dim that my phone works better than they do! I will commend them for not having bed bugs (surprisingly), but I can only speak for the room that I stayed in. The staff was not nice at all (except the cleaning lady...she was very nice to us). The walk ways upstairs were slick tile that are mopped often and very slippery...which does not help when you barely touch the railing and it moves so much that your life flashes before your eyes!!

Its like a place you would find in a scary movie. This place was a bad location, bad hotel, bad service, gross gross gross gross. The ice had stuff frozen in it. We had to Lysol our room, the toilet seat was not attached and the bathtub was not clean. Towels were stained, floor was stained, everything was stained pretty much. And the room hasn't been updated since maybe the 80s. Honestly, I think this business is a front.",July 2014,none,none,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,4,526

Unfortunately I hadn't taken the time to read other Tripadvisor reviews or I would have chosen elsewhere. The room looks like it was last updated in 1989. The towels are paper-thin, there were bugs in the sink, and there were cigarette holes on the 'non smoking' bed.   IF you are a desperate for a place to stay, then this will probably suffice. After all, the sheets seemed clean and the bed was well made.",August 2013,Don't expect a lot.,Traveled as a couple,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,526

3 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Never Again,"I stayed here Dec. 14, through Dec. 17 2008.  The location of the hotel was good for us, as we had business in the area.  I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, if you must stay at the hotel, check out the room, and make sure all the facilities are in working order.  I would not stay there again. The staff had a “Don’t bother me” attitude; every question had to go through the proper channels of management.  Our stay was on a weekend and management worked Monday through Friday.  Therefore, we had to wait until Monday before any of our questions and concerns could be addressed.  When we were able to speak to the management she had the same response, we would have to address her manager.   From the first night we checked in the facilities did not work.

The surly receptionist said he would take care of my bag which had been delayed on the flight and was being delivered later. Despite this, he later refused to accept the bag from the delivery driver, which led to it being stolen from the street outside.  When I complained, the hotel manager became abusive and screamed at me that he would check me out immediately and throw me out on the street.  All my efforts to find out what had happened to my luggage were hindered by the hotel staff, who often refused to speak at all and when they did only used broken and heavily accented english. Apart from this, the telephones were switched off regularly, the TV remote was",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,9,526
