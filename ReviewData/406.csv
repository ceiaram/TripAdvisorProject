My companion broke her leg in September and walks with a cane.  Laguna Shores is a nightmare for a handicapped person.  The second flat to which we were assigned had 21-steps to reach the door.  No elevator.  No handicapped parking.  Lots of step all around.  The staff are cuckholds to a mysterious ""manager"" who never appeared.  None of the staff was empowered to do, literally, anything.  If there was a problem such as problems with the sole electric wall heater, we were told to fill out a form to be submitted to the Board of Directors.

While it seems your stay was less than satisfactory, we urge to not let this experience sway your decision in booking with us again. Your particular unit, The Jasmine, unfortunately is 1 of only 2 rooms on property that do not come with a guaranteed parking spot. This is outlined on our website when you’re booking your reservation. With that said, if we know for certain that there is an open space available we’ll be happy to give it to you. The particular time period you were here, we were a full house. You did stay over a Friday which is our big turn-over day so it may have looked as though there were lots of open spots after everyone checked out when in fact all those spots were assigned to everyone checking in later that day. With respects to the way you were treated at check in time, that is absolutely unacceptable and our front desk has received counsel on this point. In the future, it may be beneficial for you to call the resort to book instead of booking online. This way you’ll have a better idea of what all is entailed with respects to parking, room location, room amenities etc. Thanks again for your comments and we hope to hear from you soon.

Beautiful Heisler Park and the ocean is right across the street.  Our check in process went smoothly and quickly.   The rooms are quite small & could use some updating, but they are very clean.  We had a full kitchen in our room and it was nicely done.  We did not like the location of our room, we where near the street and there is alot of street noise, and we did not have a ocean view.

You can watch sun rise and set from the ocean view studios (not all the studios have ocean views). I think if you had binoculars you might be able to watch whales and dolphins from the veranda. We adore it here, and come every year. You might not like it if you get a room near the highway, or if the noise of pedestrians from the park, and garbage trucks, street sweepers etc. bothers you, but really the beauty of the amazing location just sweeps those concerns away for us.

For the last 9 years, we have been coming with our children.  We just got back from our last visit two days ago.  What a great time we had.  First off, this location is ideal, right next to Heisler Park and a short walk to Main Beach and the town. The complex is clean and well maintained for a beach property.  I did have problems with the dishwasher leaking, but they came and fixed it immediately. Every unit we have stayed in has been slightly different, so it pays to ask alot of questions when booking.

Laguna Shores is actually a timeshare, converted from kitchenette rentals years ago. There are rentals available when an owner doesn't show up or puts it in the rental pool. There are one bedrooms, plus large and small studios. Its a collection of several 2-story buildings. The 1-bedroom and large studios are fairly roomy and have full kitchens.  The units are clean and the staff surely love working here. There is a pool and hot spa. The ocean views from the Cliff Drive-fronting units are spectacular.

The units are small & the building is old.  So if you want something new, large & modern you will not be happy.  The units look a bit tired.

Our parking was not on the premises, but one block away. Upon entering the condo, we discovered that we did not have a king bed, but a queen. The woman at the counter had the gall to argue that the bed was a king. I ended up measuring the bed to prove to her the difference between a king and queen bed.

As this reservation was made through a booking engine not directly related to Laguna Shores, I would like to point out that our resort did not make any specific promises or guarantees regarding room assignments, bed type or parking availability.
