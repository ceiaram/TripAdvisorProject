Because of the rain we mostly used the indoor options. Kitchen and hosting staff was exceptional. I truly don't think I've seen better!!! They were very attentive, making sure things were constantly stocked and cleaning up but not in the way. They took time to answer questions while still staying on top of things. Didn't miss a beat! The breakfast had a huge selection of items and changed a little each day for variety.

All entrances require keycard access at all times with the exception of the front entry, which is only locked overnight, but is constantly monitored during the day by the front desk personnel. We do also keep private security for added protection overnight as well. Please know that the incident that occurred was by no means ignored by the hotel. We found out that the person in question had come in through the side door which is located next to the public restrooms when another guest was on their way out. They immediately went into the public restroom at which time the unfortunate incident occurred. As soon as we found out about the incident we immediately sent multiple managers, supervisor, and additional staff to attempt to locate the person in question and secure the hotel.

The last thing we want to do is give people the impression that we are somehow hiding the fee, which is why we have it clearly detailed on our website and is part of the confirmation email you receive from Hilton as well as third party sites. The transient occupancy taxes are taxes imposed on all hotels by the city of Anaheim and are paid directly back to the city.

The hotel is right next door to the disneyland parking lot so all you have to do is walk to the parking lot and catch a tram to Disneyland.  So convenient and in fact faster than staying at the Disneyland hotel and taking the monorail.  The hotel lobby is great and the staff are so friendly and helpful.  I was very impressed with their free breakfast since most hotel only offer limited items but Homewood Suites offered full hot and cold breakfast.  Great perk!

During check in the front desk clerk booked my room to a person in front of me that was staying for one night and not four.

I stayed 4 nights (I have the receipt that states the number of nights) and my credit card was charged $149.76. At $16/day including the ridiculous 17% sales tax, it doesn't amount to what they charged my credit card.

The thing is the hotel parking lot is right beside the Disney parking lot. So many mornings families have the kids packed up and walk next door to the Disney Parking lot to catch the shuttle bus to  Disneyland. The main entrance of Disney seemed a bit of a walk from the hotel with young kids but there is a bus stop that can pick you up also to take you to Disney. We were about 40mins from Hollywood. One day we skipped the parks and decided to drive in that area. Very close to SNA Airport and maybe 30mins from LAX. 25mins to the closest beach. Plenty of places to eat up and down the road.

The room was really nice and obviously very clean. We were in town for the Avengers Half Marathon weekend. The staff was nice, but not all there. I had to call downstairs multiple times to find out if a portable crib was available for my daughter. I think the staff should have been a little better about following up with me instead of the opposite. Aside from that, the stay was great. I would have preferred the entire bathroom to have a door rather than just the shower and toilet as getting ready earlier than my entire family meant I had to be very quiet and basically in the dark. The breakfast area was nice and the food was fine. The hotel is on Harbor",November 2015,none,none,"Dear tanoshegir, Thank you for giving us a chance during our grand opening.

23 helpful votes,17 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dissapointed,We were so eager for this hotel to open as we have had great experiences with other Homewood suites. The hotel is clean and has great amenities and the best customer service in Anaheim. Unfortunately that was not enough to make us enjoy our stay because the noise in the hotel was unbearable. A bathroom exhaust fan runs continuously all night and all day. The walls are paper thin and we could hear the people above us. We slept poorly because of the noise and checked out early to find a more quiet hotel.,December 2015,none,none,"Dear 4realmomz, We are happy you enjoyed the amenities and service of our hotel and hotel team.

I would have rated this place 5 stars but there were 4 cons in my opinion.    The pros - The property is nice on the outside, and very nice on the inside.  Parking lot is very safe and plenty of spaces.  Parking fee is $16 which is average for hotels around Disney.  If you just walk up a block to the Toy Story parking you could jump on the free shuttles & it will save you plenty of time and money.  Otherwise you have to wait for the ART (Anaheim Resort Transportation) which runs several times an hour.  The room I stayed in was the 2 Qns/studio/suite.  This is a huge open floor plan with fully stocked kitchen.

The only thing lacking is a nice lounge like the more upscale hotels in the Hilton chain. I was on business, but this is a very family friendly hotel just down the street from the entrance of Disneyland and the other parks. I had a room on the south side on the fifth floor overlooking the basketball court and putting green. It was a very quite room. This was a good value for a king suite with fold-out couch, kitchen with full refrigerator, plates, cups, flatware and other equipment for making a light meal. But, you probably won't need it. The breakfasts are full and hearty and have everything from oatmeal,fruit and cereals, to eggs, bacon, sausages, and do it yourself waffles. In the evening, they serve wine, beer, soft drinks and heavy appetizers",December 2015,none,none,"Dear HappyTraveler0109,  Thank you so much for the kind review.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Home away from home,"This hotel is very close to Disneyland (.6 miles, 15 minutes walking) and the Convention Center (5 minutes walking). For those who do not want to walk 15 minutes, there is a Disneyland Parking Lot next to the hotel. You may walk tot he parking lot next door and hop on their Free Shuttle (20- Toy Story Line). Pick up is at Woody Stop, but you may exit Woody or Buzz Lightyear.  The hotel staff are very nice and helpful. Free breakfast is included (eggs, starch, oatmeal, fruits and waffle station everyday).  The dinner light reception is good if you can make it on time. The dinner I was able to attend was Asian night (rice, chicken teriyaki, soup, salad) and please note FREE wine and beer was offered.

49 helpful votes,53 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Too many miss/disappointments with this property,"I am starting this review by stating this is a review from a business traveler perspective, not as a family traveling to the Disneyland resort area. This property is brand new, less than a month old and a huge step up from the Homewood Suites in the Garden Grove area within a mile or so away which has become a dump! I am not sure if this is a corporate or franchise property, but nonetheless I am disappointed. I will also preface my review with the fact that I am a huge fan of Residence Inn, by Marriott, with several of these in the immediate area as well as a new one under construction right up the street. They will still be my first choice, but I wanted to check out this property. The name is Homewood Suites, it has the word “suites” in its name, yet the King room option on",December 2015,none,none,"Dear TravelingMan5989,  I am so sorry we didn’t make a good impression.
