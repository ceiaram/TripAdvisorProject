The first challenge was wall light switches that didn’t operate a light.  The new lamps are not intuitive to find the “on” switch so I entered a dark room and couldn’t get lights on.   There is an ceiling fan with lights that when you find the switch it is like flood lights- so bright I turned them off.   The ceiling fan does not work regardless of what button you push.  The sofa is new but hard as a rock.  So difficult to get comfortable.   The sofa is perpendicular to the wall the tv is on so the placement is not right whatsoever.

They even offer to do the grocery shopping for free if they are provided a list. I would give this Residence Inn a thumbs up.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,127,264
