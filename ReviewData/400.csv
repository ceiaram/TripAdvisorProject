It is close to the airport and close to the beach and not too far from Disneyland :) Most hotels right on the beach or near it are very expensive, but this hotel is very reasonable! It is clean, I feel safe here and the office workers are always very friendly and go out of their way to make your stay the best it can be!!",June 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,283,400

10 helpful votes,23 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lovely motel and wonderful staff,"My sister and I stayed in this motel for 2 weeks whilst on holiday in California. The staff were wonderful and very helpful- particularly Midge! We didn't have a car on holiday, so the staff were very helpful when organizing taxis (find the best prices etc) and helping us with our bus routes- very good customer service!  Our room was cleaned on a daily basis and the bathroom was immaculate. I have seen some reviews on here about the bathroom being rusty, dirty etc.... our bathroom was very clean and there was no rust, dirt anywhere- we were very pleased with this   We used the pool area on a daily basis, this was lovely as it was very secluded and we could relax and enjoy the pool/sunbathe in peace. The pool was also clean  Overall, very nice place to stay for the money  Thanks",June 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,285,400
4 helpful votes,6 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We've been staying here for years,"We love to visit to the Newport Beach area several times a year and for the last 11 years or so we have always stayed at this motel. The location is great, easy biking distance to the beach and Newport Pier, plus very close to the 55 or PCH.  On this trip, as all past ones, the room was clean & good sized, and there was no noise or any problems at all.    The staff has always been wonderful and extremely welcoming.  In fact, we hadn't been able to go down for almost a year and when we returned last October, we were greeted like old friends. Not sure what staff members other reviewers could have encountered, but Mike, Nargis, and Midge are warm and wonderful people. We will be back!",June 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,286,400
1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Days Inn, Costa Mesa.... NASTY! CHEAP! GROSS! RUDE!","Nasty hotel!   Ridiculously Cheap People. Bath tub and shower was painted with latex paint and was falling off, sticking to our feet.   Gross bedding, at least 10 years old. Sink barely drained. Every noise could be heard due to the lack of insulation.  Free breakfast amounted to dry cereal, milk and shrink wrapped muffins served in lobby that was barely 20 square feet.   Oh, don't dare not check out on time......  they will remove ALL your personal affects and store in laundry room!",February 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,287,400
1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disgusting,"This was the most disgusting hotel we've ever stayed at. the bathroom was filthy, the shelves hadn't been cleaned in what looked like years. Mirrors smeared, the bath tub full of cracks and rust. The shower head was black and didn't work, ceiling vents windows sills filthy from years of dirt build up. I've seen gas stations with cleaner toilet bowls Shower curtain had mold on it. refrigerator was defrosting and full of water.Only got two small towels, when asked for more we were told there was a limit. No ice maker. Room was large in size. Bed was comfortable, office staff Very rude.",January 2010,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,288,400
22 helpful votes,18 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointing,"I will list the good items first.  The room was a bit larger than average. The bathroom was ok.  The room had a frig, micro, coffee maker.  Internet access (yea!!).  The bed was comfortable.  Lots of chairs.  A very good selection of Cable channels.  AC worked.  The bad.  There were a few small holes in the wall and a panel that had been cut out of the wall was very obvious the wallpaper was done badly.  The pool shut down at 7PM!  The staff that was on at 8PM was not friendly, nor were they accommodating.   This motel would have rated much lower if it had not been for the front desk clerk that was on at 4:30AM the next morning.  He greeted me with a smile and was very helpful.  And, no I will not stay there again.",April 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,289,400
