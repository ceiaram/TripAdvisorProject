Room was bare- like it got forgotten to be decorated- non specific- could have been anywhere, USA.  I arrived early for the conference- and even as a Marriott Loyalty member- I was given a room with a balcony facing the convention center roof-pic attached.   Luckily the noise from the HVAC system provided adequate white noise to help with sleeping. My co-worker was not so lucky with a room facing front of the hotel- where all the noises carried up early morning and late night from events below in the plaza.  Food at restaurant was average.

To get a 4 star you'd have to have quite some amenities, service, standard to acquire that and they didn't achieve that. Why I say that.. let me point it out here.  #1- prior to checking in, I called in to inform Marriott about our Rewards numberbecause I booked it through Priceline, I wanted to make sure whatever it is get credited. Btw, note this folks, if you book your reservation through 3rd party.. you don't get points credited at all. Which don't make sense because they still get paid by the 3rd party. Lol.

The hotel is very large and also busy with regular conferences taking place and the bar area gets extremely noisy with everyone trying to talk louder than the person next to them which is no fault of the hotel. The room was a decent size with a balcony but had 2 smaller double beds instead of 1 king or queen which would have been nicer. My only complaint apart from a $100 charge to my room from the restaurant that I knew nothing about was the $25 a night charge for parking. We were here for a holiday and I think the hotel should have a more favourable rate for people staying longer than a couple of nights.

At first we were hesitant to book this hotel as it is ""off-site"" and seemed quite far from the Disneyland resort.

They did offer the use of the Hilton's pool across the street, but after a long day of walking at Disney Land, this was not really appealing.  Food at nFuse was excellent.  Server was lovely.  Front desk staff were friendly.  Rooms were clean - and our bed types were met.  The room was not worth the room rate we paid since we didn't really get what we booked for.

First our trip was specifically to visit Disneyland with my wife, 3 adult children and my daughter in law.  I booked a few months prior to the trip and got a pretty good rate considering the holidays.  Pros:  - I have the Marriott app on my phone.  This let me check in ahead of time.  As we were riding on the Super Shuttle from the airport at 12:30 pm, the app send me an email saying our rooms were ready.

Given the rate was $70/night, the additional charges ($28/day for valet and $12.95/day for internet) for our 2 night stay basically made up the difference for any loss on their part, in my humble opinion.

Trouble was, when the conventioneers left, the hotel catering team decided to make money by holding commerical dinners round the pools.  One pool was closed from 11am for a dinner starting at 5.30pm.  Then the other pool was closed because a nearby diner dropped a glass into it.  The staff's solution was to send my family by taxi to the Marriott Suites a few blocks away.  Problem was, taxi drivers don't like their vouchers, and when you arrive at the Suites, the pool there is behind a locked gate.
