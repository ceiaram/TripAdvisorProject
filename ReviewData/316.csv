Towels are discussed by the management here incredibly often.

So had our housekeeping department noticed the stain, we would not have left it in your room. Everything at our hotel is thoroughly washed after every use, we use the market standard triple-sheeting method to make our beds, so this creates a huge amount of laundry daily, but it is really worth it. Our sheets are all white and that helps us replace what needs replacing and keep things as clean as possible as well. Cant hide anything on white, and thats why our towels and sheets are white.I wish I can know more about what made you feel that the room needed more cleaning, our housekeeping ladies work really hard and its not often that we hear that kind of feedback.

Any time we aren't a 5 all-the-way we are very disappointed and look ways we can improve any and all of our services.   Thank you for the kind things that you said about our property. In regards to your title, our building itself is only about 12 years old. We consider ourselves a business/budget class hotel. There are a couple properties in the surrounding area who regularly charge two or three TIMES our rate, but despite that discrepancy, we provide a stunningly similar product, a 500sqft guest room with kitchenettes, free wifi, parking, and 24hr a day manned desk, as well as the amazing breakfast that you commented on as well - at no additional charge! We have a single upfront fee  and apart from taxes, that's all you pay. That said, we are continually upgrading our little hotel. Most recently we have replaced the vast majority of our sofas, which have been mentioned here on tripadvisor in the past with some awesome modern leather sofas.  In regards to our location... with so many free mapping services, it is difficult to reconcile how this can be such a serious issue for any traveler who chooses to stay with us. We have an address, which anyone anywhere can look up and decide whether or not our facility meets their specific needs.  We are 20 minutes away from John Wayne Airport. I can say that with certainly because everyday I carpool and everyday I have to go to John Wayne before I come to work. Maybe that's a lot of travel time if your not a commuter, but 20 minutes really doesn't seem so bad when you pay a hotel bill half the price (or a third!) as the hotels alongside John Wayne. Furthermore, a great majority of our guests work at Panasonic, Del Taco, and many other local businesses who have buildings literally a block or two away. We are also incredibly convenient for Lake Forest, Foothill Ranch or Laguna Woods locals who need a place for friends or family to stay, as we are centrally located to all three, just blocks away!  In regards to our pool, we do not claim to have an Olympic sized swimming pool. We have pictures of it online, and guests have also posted pictures, it is true that it is not large, but it is in fact heated. Because we are in Southern California, we do not need to heat it much. In fact, because it is an outdoor poor, the heater usually comes in handy only a bit in the winter. Our hot-tub is in working order now as well, as it usually is. I will say about our pool that while it is not an expansive body of water, it is incredibly clean and well maintained. Our pool servicing company does an amazing job, really really great.  I am so sorry that you felt that our customer service left anything to be desired. We all need to be friendly and helpful at all times, and you can rest assured that we will all diligently review your comments for guidance in our daily work.   We hope that the next time you are in the area you stay with us again and give us an opportunity to better meet your expectations.",none,none,none,none,none,none,82,316

While we are not a 5 star resort, we pride ourselves on having a clean, budget-friendly hotel that strives for perfection, and anytime any of our guests are not pleased with us we look for what we can do better.   In regards to the housekeeping issue you experienced during your stay... when there is a DND sign on our guest doors we take that to mean that you do not want your room to be visited by a housekeeper that day. I understand that sometimes you had it on from the night before, and perhaps you remove it later in the morning, but unfortunately we don't have a real-time way of tracking which rooms still have it on and which don't. It's just best as a general idea that if you want service during your stay to not have that sign on your door so we can be sure to service your room.   I am glad that we were able to provide you with freshly cleaned towels and sheets immediately upon request.  In regards to our coffee, I'm surprised that you didn't enjoy it. We provide our guests with 100% organic and rain forest certified Brazilian grounds which are provided in complimentary in room packets and during breakfast hours. In regards to our waffle-maker and toaster, I can assure you that they have not been out of commission or pulled from use at all this year. The waffle-maker, although intimidating to use as it's not a device non-hotel goers encounter commonly, is actually pretty simple to use as you only have to turn it once and it beeps to let you know to turn it, and it beeps when the timer reaches zero to let you know to remove your waffle. We have further simplified the process by having a batter dispenser with labeled batter measuring cups.  I am very sorry if any staff had any shortcomings with you what-so-ever.

It was inspected not because there was an issue, but because every inch of our facility, every room, gets vigorously inspected to maintain the high standards that we pride ourselves on, and welcome any guest, any person the ability to review these documents!  Any claim of this nature that occurs days after a guest leaves, and after such a lengthy stay are always suspect to any professional in this industry, but after multiple inspections by our staff and (verifiable) pest service professionals we are without a doubt that there was no pest issue in your room.

We definitely allow pets to accompany our guests and charge a comparatively low $20 a night pet fee. Due to the prevalence of pet allergies we do a intensive dander cleaning apart from our regular thorough room cleaning and this fee covers the extra cost that imposes. I'll also take the time to mention that we are very vigilant about noise and do not hesitate to contact guests who's furry children cause disturbances to other guests, and we are also keep close track of room assignments to further mitigate noise issues, regardless of how rare they are.

We too consider ourselves quirky and this is reflected in our extensive green initiatives that happen mostly behind the scenes! We recycle everything from our newspapers to our lightbulbs and batteries to do our part to keep our local water sources and beaches contaminant free. We source as many disposable products as possible from manufacturers that utilize recycled and recyclable materials, and the vast majority of our cleaning products are similarly environmentally friendly. Soon we will even be partially powered by solar panels.  We are sorry that you found our elevator slow. For (hopefully) future reference you can find stairs at either end of our building. We are similarly sorry that you found the lack of kitchen supplies in your room unaccommodating. Not all of our guest utilize our kitchens, and frankly it would be time-intensive and expensive to maintain a full array of supplies in every room. The only thing I would mention on this matter is that we always have enough ""dishkits"", pots/pans, and cooking utensils for our guests who request them, and if at booking you know that you'll be needing them, it would be our absolute pleasure to place them in your room to await your arrival. I will still give this issue much thought as it has been mentioned before.   Lastly, I would like to apologize for the really difficult shower knob you encountered. As soon as I read this comment I had our maintenance technician start to examine every room at our hotel for this issue and we are happy to say that we replaced several shower knobs - thanks to your review!

In your review, you mention that you booked through the third party booking service called Hotwire, and you also mention that you booked a room with two queen beds but received a room with only a king bed and a pullout sofa. We take issue with that statement. We honor all the reservations made with our property as they come to us, we never ""bait and switch"" our guests under any circumstances ever. In fact, it is impossible for you to have booked a room with two queen beds via Hotwire, as we control what they are allowed to sell, and we have only ever allowed Hotwire to sell rooms with a single king bed. The vast majority of our rooms have sofa pull-out beds, this is just one aspect of our rooms that makes us a little different, and a little better from other properties (we also have kitchenettes, and free wifi in every room!).  In any case, sometimes guests find that they booked a room that doesn't fit their needs and in those cases we do our absolute best to accommodate them at our hotel regardless of whether or not they booked with us, third parties, or even telepathically. However, because of availability constraints (we were sold out) we were only able to honor the reservation you yourself reserved. Our housekeeping department is the most thorough imaginable in the service industry. Every floor is cleaned daily, and the air freshener used in our rooms is a rather expensive, all natural eucalyptus essential oil. We have never been flooded or any such thing, and we receive very high praise in these regards daily.  In regards to our pool, I'm sorry that the size of our pool's size is not satisfactory to your needs. Most of our guests park in front of our  hotel where the vast majority of our parking is, however we do have a limited amount of additional parking that is located in the back of our hotel, there are five spaces at both ""sides"" of the pool. Lastly, our hotel's elevator has never presented issues and is inspected as mandated by law. I have to admit however that it isn't the fastest elevator in the world, it recently clocked in at 15 seconds going from pushing the button on the ground floor to the doors opening fully on the third floor, but we do have convenient stairs at both the east and west sides of our building for our more physically able guests to take advantage of.

The room I stayed in had a separate bedroom and separate AC. The flat screen in the living room had PC options and seemed more complicated than was worth it for me. The room was clean. Decor in community areas was different, not sure of the theme. There was a small pool and spa in the rear. It was raining and there was no cover. The spa jets are high on the wall, so the water was bubbly, but not conducive to focusing on your back. You pass through the small breakfast area to get to the pool. Water in the pipes from someone else's shower was noisy, but was made better by closing the closet door.

I live in Southern Orange County and I have stayed in almost every hotel. I frequently book rooms with my girlfriend when we want some piece and quiet away from the house. We've tried every hotel within a 20 mile radius; and Prominence is by FAR the BEST. First, I would like to mention the bedding. Prominence uses an Eco-memory foam, comparable to tempur-pedic. I have never gotten a better night's sleep at any other hotel. Second, the costumer service is incomparable to any near-by location.
