The facilities are clean, they offer all the important amenities, the location is excellent--and most importantly, the staff and managers are helpful, thoughtful, responsive and patient!   I had to contact this hotel 3 times (for various reasons--documentation, receipts, etc), and each time they responded in less than 24 hrs and helped me with even my more complex issues!   Any hotel can offer amenities and a fair price--but its the customer service that sets an establishment apart.  What is more important than receiving help when you need it???  Few places I have stayed in years of travel have been so courteous and responsive!   I HIGHLY recommend this hotel because their customer",February 2020,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,314
1 helpful vote,3 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Avoid-Horrible Experience,"Don’t believe the pictures you see on the internet, this place looks and smells like a dump. The first indication I shouldn’t have even stayed there was the sign that said, “No refunds, no exceptions.” Walked in to a room that had beer cans on the floor, pillows with things on them, dirty and smelly sheets. Carpet felt like mush. DONT TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF. The toilet ran all night. Tried to call the front desk and tell them it ran and was so loud but nobody answered. Finally packed up and left at like 3am. Told the guy at the front desk as I was leaving about the loud toilet and that I couldn’t sleep and he offered no apology. Slept in my car in a hospital parking lot, and had much better of a sleep. Gross. Avoid this place.",August 2018,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,314

6 helpful votes,5 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best Budget Hotel Ever,"So first it needs to point out that I only needed a bed to sleep at night. So if you are looking for a fancy five star experience, this is not the place for you. That being said, I am very satisfied with my experience staying there. There are very few places not to like about the hotel. It's very affordable compared to those next Disneyland. Then the room is very well kept. I dare say it's much cleaner than my room at home. The AC is quiet and powerful. The temperature is perfect. The matress is very comfortable, soft and firm. It gave me a good night's sleep. No bug problem at all. I know some place can be very nasty, but not here. The bathroom is as simple as it should be. The water is powerful and warm. Staff is also helpful with all kinds of stuff.

I requested first floor rooms they said we would have both of our rooms on the first floor. When we got there she said only one was available. The carpet on the first floor was dingy and syained, the stair to the second had accumulated dust and dirt covering the corners.

I called the night before and was told that I could check in any time. What wasn't said was that I could check in IF there was a room available.  When I showed up at 10am I was told that no one had checked out yet. Fortunately, someone came to check out while I was at the front desk.  The room was clean and available in about 30- minutes. Room was clean and had everything one would expect in a hotel in this price range.  There is no air conditioning so the room was a little warm.

Terrific Inn!,"I definitely recommend it if you're on a budget, because after all we are all price conscious when it comes to staying at places.

I believed they has renovated or upgrade the place very well.  The location was super nice! The front desk was super helpful to help out with directions. And the room was actually really homey like. Even though there is a Starbucks right across the street, but the hotel actually also provide free coffee and pastries in the morning.   I realized the location is super close to Disneyland, which can also be a great spot for family vacation, especially with their reasonable price!

I'm not a hotel stickler, and honestly didn't have too many expectations about the Grand Inn. No frills, and just a place to stay as we were visiting the House of Mouse all week. Check-in was fast and easy, thank you to the front desk staff! I was also offered a bottle of cold water, so nice of her! I did reserve a non-smoking room, however, the room smelled like a little bit like someone had still smoked in there. It didn't really bother us though.

The man who checked us in gave us the impression we were interrupting a lousy day and he wanted to get back to sulking.

No screen on the first floor window and the window opened about 4"" before the lock engaged.  The towels were very old and barely dried.  The water was hot.  The walls were really thin.
