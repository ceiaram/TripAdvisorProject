The Hampton Inn won't disappoint. • Late-model 32"" HDTVs. • Spacious rooms, especially the bathroom, which was cavernous! • The most friendly and helpful staff i've ever encountered. • Free parking and internet. • The free breakfast goes beyond the typical ""continental"" breakfast of juice and a cold danish by providing a rotation of hot items. Perhaps you'll see pre-made omelets one morning, and biscuits and gravy the next. • Great location.  Minutes from the beach and the Naval Weapons Station.

As with our last stay the staff, rooms (the beds are so comfy) and breakfast were outstanding.

The hotel is right next to a Boeing building and a naval base, but the facilities are brand new, located a couple of miles next to the coast, Seal Beach, the air is clean and the place is serene, very peaceful.

We were even able to change our room immediately without hassle.  (Nothing wrong with the room, it was our choice to move)  Hampton is part of the Hilton Hotel collection, although just a small step down from an actual Hilton Hotel proper.  Everything was neat, clean, and new, as I beleive this hotel was just finished sometime in 2009 or late 2008.  They have the well known hot breakfast, which is different everyday, you definatley won't go hungry, they do a nice job.  The beds are very comfortable (Hilton has the sweet dreams beds in all thier hotels I think) so needless to say, a good nights sleep, as the pillows were great too.

3 helpful votes,4 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Just What I Was Looking For,"I stay at this property at least once every couple months and thought I would finally share a review.  Everything is very clean as the hotel is only about 8 months old (I think).  My favorite part of the rooms are flat screen HD televisions in every room.  For someone who is just looking for a comfortable place to sleep and to watch the game on TV that night, it's ideal.  Also has the same amenities that other Hampton's have: free internet, free breakfast, and the Hampton bed.  The beds are great - extremely comfortable.  The breakfast is ok.  As for the hot stuff, somedays are better than others, but I usually just grab a muffin / bagel / coffee / banana and head out.  Service is awesome.

This hotel is directly adjacent to the Los Alamitos Reserve Station and the Boeing Company, so best to have a car since it is not an ""in town"" type of place.  The hotel is brand new and very clean. It is very geared to the business traveler, though we found it comfortable for our vacation stay as well. We had a room with a small kitchen area with a microwave and small frig, which we like so we can feel more at home on a longer stay.

I didn't feel like spending $500 a night for the Huntington Beach Hyatt and the Huntington Beach Hilton was sold out, this was the next best choice for me based on location and cost.  The hotel is brand new so everything is clean.  However, we had a bed side lamp that didn't work and there was no way to turn the bathroom fan off, it ran all day/night.  Also, there were some teenagers staying in the room across the hall from mine and they were smoking in their room (I both saw and smelled this).
