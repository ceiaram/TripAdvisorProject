I was unsure if I needed to purchase before arriving to their property, so I called, and I was 152 place in line! with a projected 48 min wait time before speaking to someone!! So I then tried their online chat, and I was 33rd in line. This made it very frustrating, as I didn't want to spend all morning on hold trying to figure it out. So, I went ahead and didn't purchase the pass while booking my room.  When we arrived, we got there at noon. I know check in time isn't until 4pm, but decided to give it a try anyway.

No complaints about the water park.Cons: Our Room 213 which was a Family Suite was located right next door to the Iron Horse Fitness Center. There was a single wall separating our bed from all the treadmills on the other end of the wall. So each and every morning our sleep would get messed up because we would hear loud thumping and banging from people working out next door on the treadmills and it would wake us up and keep us up until they stopped using",December 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,626,75

You have to walk way down the hall(s) to get to the elevator.m, go several floors down (stopping along the way), walk through hotel/lobby, outside, then they put a smoking area like 50 yards from the front entrance.

This will add an extra expense and hassle for us to get to Disneyland in the morning. They advertise the shuttle and if it's that popular then they should add more shuttle runs to accommodate the demand of their guests. Second issue is the indoor water park is rather hot, humid and noisy. For a Mom just trying to relax while her teens are running around the water park it's not that great. The outdoor pool is nice.

If you have one daredevil child and one very cautious child, there are attractions for both of them.  However, if they’re young and do not have co-conspirators, then chances are you will have to decide which parent or guardian will go on each ride or attraction with them.  The same goes for Magiquest, parents and children running around the hotel from floor to floor doing this scavenger hunt.

I took advantage of booking 60 days in advanced and was given a very reasonable rate (particularly considering the proximity to Disneyland) for a basic room that sleeps up to six. The room was motel-like in its amenities (there is no hair conditioner provided) complete with ratty string-laden towels and a clunky wall unit a/c.  On the upside the a/c unit was immediately fixed or perhaps even replaced when we called the front desk. For that we were tremendously grateful. The water park which is included and plethora of other kiddie activities which all cost extra are well appointed and much grander than I anticipated.

The weather was calling for a very hot day so I searched online for water parks. Reviews for Aquatica were not great and the Knotts water park was closed and the rides park was not appealing given it was supposed to be really warm but I did come across this spot in my search. I called the hotel and you could not take a day pass, however, they had a great rate for the night at $199 with $50 dining credit so with taxes and fees it was $272.

Our 3 yr old is mildly autistic and has a severe speech delay, so more like a 2 yr old. She did enjoy wading around in the indoor and outdoor kiddie area, but I think she would have had more fun if she was a year older. She was too scared to go on any of the slides, and they don't allow parents to hold children on their laps on the slides for safety reasons. My husband and I took turns going on the slides and definitely had fun. We rented an outdoor cabana, so that we didn't have to go back to the room to get stuff for the kids and to get out of the scorching sun.

Oddly enough there was an ebb & flow to the lines for the tandem rides. Sometimes you would have to wait in line for 10 minutes, at other times you could walk right on the slide; not clear why that is the case.

Every family should find some time in their schedule to spend at least one night at this resort. The waterpark has something for everyone no matter the age.

When you visit there is so much to do in the waterpark and throughout the hotel there is really no reason to leave the resort. Rooms are set up for families which is great. Staff is welcoming and friendly. The jammie dance parties in the lobby at night are super fun. The only complaint I have is that the food is pretty outrageously priced. Hamburgers in the waterpark are 5.79 for a plain burger. Add another $1.00 for cheese and Fries are an additional $3.00 something.

One adult couple slept on the queen bed and the other adult couple slept less than 3 feet away on a sofa bed that was extremely uncomfortable.  In hindsight, we would have been better to bring our own air mattress.  The kids did have fun.  Bought the Paw Pass that helped to keep them busy.

The lack of music in and outside the waterpark is non existent and good luck finding chairs midday for your family because towels are reserving almost all except in the kiddie park.

We are sorry to hear of the issues you encountered after swimming in our water park.  We always recommend guests to shower prior to entering the water so that there will be fewer particles on the body that can negatively interact with the chemicals we use to keep our water clean.  It is this negative interaction that results in dry/itchy skin.  To mitigate this, we also ask guests to shower after exiting the water to wash those exposed areas that once dry, can become irritated.  We hope you will choose to stay with us again soon!

The hotel is in a somewhat strange area  - in the middle of a suburban residential neighborhood about 3-4 miles from the Disneyland area. There was nowhere really to walk of interest, and the views were of an apartment complex and houses that shared a backyard wall with the hotel. We did see that the hotel did have a shuttle to the parks (I believe for $5.00 per day per person) that departed about every 30 minutes.   Although the hotel appeared to be pretty close to full, we did not find the water park to be too crowded at all.

The reason I'm unsure if I would come back is because 3 of the main slides were shut down during a good portion of our stay which is really disappointing. My kids are bigger and the slides are what they were interested in most. The whole facility should be up and running when you spend that kind of money to come stay at the resort. I also had to contact the resort after our stay to dispute charges that weren't mine.  The person I spoke to was very kind and removed the charges but I think there needs to be some adjustments to the wristbands to make them more accurate.

I would highly recommend that you arrive early but do the bowling, glow golf, Magi Quest, arcade etc. FIRST.  You will not have to wait for these things because everyone is at the water park. Have an early dinner and then hit the water park around 6:00 pm. This is when everyone is leaving for dinner or just because they're done for the day.  We did this and did not have to wait in long lines for any of the water park rides. That was a huge plus. The kids can play Magi Quest for a couple more hours after the water park closes also.

Its meant for the kids of course but the price tag is definitely adultish....  $1000 for two nights is a little steep if you ask me.  My suggestion is to get the Wolf Den which is the room with the bunk beds for kids so you have your space.  The rooms are very plain but it is what it is.  Save money by bringing snacks and your own drinks.  They do not prohibit that at all and if I wasn't so lazy I would have gone to the CVS next door.  So if you have one of those drink coolers that keep things cold for 24 hours imagine the possibilities!!  there is a fridge in the room so you could save a ton.

The Buffet was wonderful and the Grill by the pool was delicious.  The only problem is finding a seating place at the water park when you get there at the 1-3 check in.  People from the night before have the option of using the water park after they check out.  This caused a bit of a problem to find somewhere to sit.

A very secure and gated shallow area for the younger kids.  Very attentive lifeguards everywhere.    While the food was basic quality, it wasn't super expensive.  Kids meals ranged from $5-$8. You can also bring your own food which can really help keep costs down.  Its been three days since our visit and I asked my kids last night, ""Hey, for spring break, do you want to Disney, Magic",February 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4946,75

We waited for about and hour and 30 minutes before we finally got to check in at the front desk.  Our room was on the 6th floor and it was very far away from the elevators. It's quite a walk (room 644).   Our view was of the roof top of the building next door. We got the standard room with two queen beds. It has a refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker. It was clean and had enough room to walk around. The bed was comfortable enough. I liked the pillows.  The water park was a lot of fun.  Be careful though because the floors could get slippery.

We were so excited to have a glass of wine, dinner and play in the waterslides with our kids that we lost complete track of time!  It's not just a place that the kids have fun, my husband and I had a blast being kids again, plus enjoying the benefits of being an adult (GREAT BAR OUTSIDE BY THE WAY).   Both kids asked if they could change their birthday parties to Great Wolf instead of Disneyland and that is a no brainer for us!

If you're looking for a fun place to stay that's extremely kid friendly... Then this place is for you. With its fun camping theme, amazing watermark, and games throughout, you'll never be bored. The park is within earshot of Disneyland too.   If you're wondering whether friends if guests are allowed in the water park, the answer is yes.

We, of course, knew that there would be some issues coming in... What kid doesn't want to be at a brand new water park on opening weekend? But what parent doesn't expect the logistics of it to be a nightmare? And, yes, indeed, we hit a few snafus.. we waited two hours in the check in line, to a room that we eventually got into six hours later, our water park passes/room key/hotel charge bracelets did not account charge properly, and at dinner they were out of both the wine I ordered and the brussel sprouts my husband ordered, BUT my, goodness, as hassled as the staff must have been from hours of dealing with frustrated guests, everyone single staff member to s person with whom I interacted was so obviously trying to make the best of a",February 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4950,75
4 helpful votes,9 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Resort with great promise,"First of all I will start this by saying it was the grand opening. That said check in was awful. I waited almost 2 hours like a lot of people. However the staff was friendly and seemed like they were trying hard.  The resort did give  a 25 dollar resort credit for the issue.  The indoor water park is incredible. Also all of the amenities for children is really unmatched. I felt like it was a las vegas for kids.  Everything stays open until 10 or 11pm. I have 3 children under 8 and they loved it.  There were some other issues with the restaurants as well. In the end the resort gave everyone a 150 dollar reduction in rate and tried their best. Highly recommended, but they have to work out some of the kinks and I hope they do.",February 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4951,75
19 helpful votes,31 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Grand-opening glitches,"We stayed at Great Wolf Lodge on opening night 2/19/16 in a standard room. Check-in was about a 20minute wait (as we got there early. Later in day the lines were even longer --maybe hours wait?). We had a standard room. It was clean, smelled of fresh paint. A/C was very noisy. Sink is outside of bathroom which is good for families. There was a coffee maker and small fridge, which we did not use. It was a clean, motel-quality room. We saw a mosquito this morning in room, probably from all the dampness. Does not bode well for long-term quality of this room. It was fine when brand new.  We had a late lunch at The Lodge, which serves Applebee's style food and was pretty good. That early in day, no lines and service was great.

8 helpful votes,2 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Opening day,We're from Northern California and usually fly to Washington for our GWL adventures but we got a postcard advertising this new location and decided to give it a try.   Our daughters are 11 and they love GWL. They have all their Magiquest gear from our previous 4 trips and can hardly wait to continue their game.    We expected there would be bumps during their opening weekend but we are pretty shocked that it's so disorganized.  We called at 9am on opening day to find out what time we should come and they told us 1pm. The line was crazy long and it took 1.5 hours before I reached the front and got the bracelets that allow us access to our room and the water park. My husband spent that 1.5 hours with the kids trying to get their Magiquest activated. He purchased one of the three,February 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4953,75

Its my daughter's 7th birthday and we dont always celebrate birthdays extravagantly since we are a family of six.  The manager/supervisor Diana was able to help us upgrade our room.  I have spent so much time calling and almost everyday I visited the website just to see if the upgrade becomes available. Diana was easy to approach and told me beforehand that it might not be possible, but she still offers to check what she can find.  I saw her diligence.  Jessie, the front desk clerk was also very helpful when i went back and asked them to reset our room access. We are so excited to stay in our upgraded room and play at the waterpark.
