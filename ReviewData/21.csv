Rooms present clean and in good working order. They are replacing the old TV's with flat screens but mine was an old one  - still ok.  Its a little noisy between rooms at times, mostly on weekends.  The normal customer seems to be longer term stayers - people from the surrounding businesses. Free laundry facilities that are very well utilized.

It was half the cost of the Residence Inn down the street but had all the same amentities except for breakfast, but for the price, who cares! It was very clean and though we did not use the weight room, we thought it was awesome that it was attached to the laundry room so you can workout while you do a load of laundry, for free!",July 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,79,21

none,2 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,It's worth it for extended stay,"We spent 5 weeks here (my husband and our 1yr old son).  The sofa has some stain on it and I found a sock behind the tv cabinet.  They changed the sofa cushion cover on the same day.  As others indicated, this is extended stay so room cleaning is once a week which is not sufficient when you have a toddler.  We requested daily vacuum and they did it on altenate day.  Sometimes we borrowed vacuum from them at night but there's a night where it was unavailable.   Rooms have a recliner, sofa bed, full sized refrigerator, microwave, 2 burner range, sink and dishwasher, big bathroom. Utensils, cookware and dishes are provided. There is a gym and free laundry too. Staffs are friendly and helpful except for one serious grumpy man who makes you feel uncomfortable asking for detergent or",March 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,81,21
2 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice Hotel - Beware of long distance  telephone charges,Stayed there for two weeks in October 2007. Nice spacious room...  friendly reception staff. If you know the area / have transport this is a convenient place  to stay.. if not... hope you  like walking / using Taxi cabs.  Real lack of local information in room... i.e. nearest restaurant / family restaurant / convenience store.   When I returned home I realised that I had been charged $108.95 for a twenty minute call to Ireland - talk about an utter rip off !!!!!  Hotel information pack utterly devoid of any reference to telephone rates  -  now I know why! Gerry,October 2007,none,none,Thank you for your review.  The hotel did refund the charge for the long distance call to the guest and we do inform all guests of our calling policies.,none,none,none,none,none,none,82,21
4 helpful votes,6 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Good place to stay!,"Thanksgiving brought us down to Orange County and the Candlewood Suites were the closest to our son's home. The rooms were spacious, the place was clean and well furnished. We spent 5 days there. We were treated well, and supplies were available when needed. It was quite quiet as it is off the main freeway. We'll be sure to go there on any return trips. There is no daily maid service but we saved money  using the kitchen for breakfasts which included a dishwasher for cleaning up. Replacement towels were available from the staff.  A great value, particularly for Orange County accommodations.",November 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,83,21
85 helpful votes,77 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good Value,"I spent 9 weeks here (May-June-July 07) on an extended business assignment.  The hotel was clean and quiet and was ideally located for my work.  As others indicated, this is extended stay so room cleaning is once a week.  Rooms have a full sized refrigerator, microwave, 2 burner range, sink and dishwasher.  Utensiles, cookware and dishes are provided.  There is a free laundry on site which is a real bonus for extended stay.  The drawbacks are there are no restaurants within a mile or two so if you're not cooking in the room it's a little drive.  Given the southern California climate the real shortcoming was not having a pool.  That would have made the weekends a little more enjoyable while away from home.  In all a very good value if your travel has you on an extended stay.",June 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,84,21
56 helpful votes,15 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,good if you know what to expect from extended stay,"I've stayed at this hotel a number of times this year, always one night at a time (even though it's designed more for extended stays).  I've stayed at other extended stays hotels in the past (like Studio Plus, etc), and this is roughly similar.  The front desk is not open in the middle of the night (tho there is provision for check in or check out then), the linens are only changed once a week (or once per stay if you stay less than a week), there is a kitchenette (including microwave, full size refrigerator, dishwasher, and stovetop ranges, and but no conventional oven) and a small pantry of food for sale (honor system) but no ""breakfast"" (other than what you may put together from the pantry).  On some stays, however, I find the pantry to be poorly stocked.  The rooms are clean",August 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,85,21
