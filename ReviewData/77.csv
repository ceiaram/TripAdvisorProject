We picked this hotel since it is across the Pacific Highway from Huntington Beach. It is close proximity to the beach.   We had over 14 Suite nights at this hotel during this stay. We were disappointed at the value of these Suites. Each costed 800$ a night with small space and substandard bedding and furniture.  What was really disappointing to us was customer management at this hotel. First, this hotel hid under the Covid name to not do daily housekeeping in our Suites. We had to ask for it each day. Even when we asked for it,  one day, they did not do it. Management blamed it on short of staff.  We could not check into one of our Suites until 5pm the day before.

The paint is peeling terribly all over the exterior, the bars and waterslides were closed every time we went to use them. Also, the hotel itself is not exactly waterfront.

For a resort price (we paid more than $500/night), we expected some amenities to be part of the price tag - WiFi as a starter. But no, they charge a sneaky resort fee of $33/day for your WiFi and “complementary” water bottles that you can ask for at the front desk.

It wasn’t too busy since the holidays were over and it is winter at the beach. Service was as one would expect at a hotel at this level. The real thorn in the foot is that this hotel seems to make a virtue of using additional charges as a way to keep the displayed room rate low and look like they are good value .... this is a mirage as they are artificial. The adds ons that really whack you are 1) Only Valet parking charged at a crazy $42 a DAY with no self park alternative offered 2) a Resort charge of $ 33 with  taxes per day which is $38 which is not optional. These 2 charges add  $80 per day on top of your room rate so suddenly your room does not look such good,February 2020,none,none,"Dear groovyguitar,  Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your recent stay.

We have celebrated the impact that the anticipatory service of the Room Attendant had on making you feel cared for, with the entire Housekeeping team as it reinforces our service training.  In contrast, we are sorry to hear that your stay was anything less than satisfactory and as a Resort Team, we have discussed the feedback you provided in order to improve.   While we always strive to delight our Diamond members with the very best room and at the very least, a one-tier upgrade based on availability, at times, the resort occupancy may not permit.  We do regret that we could not delight with an upgrade into the Twin Dolphin tower and that you were not satisfied with the Huntington Tower room.  Moreover, that we were not able to resolve the issues with the smell and water temperature as well, make an effort to minimize outside noise.  Given the opportunity, I am confident that these issues could have been resolved so, I am researching our Manager On Duty reports to understand if our team was aware and how we handled this situation.  As it is our service promise to “Make It Right”, please know that when a guest reports a problem, it is our intention to meet and exceed expectations when finding a solution so this feedback will also help with developing our team.    Regarding your sentiment about the inclusions in the complimentary continental breakfast at The Boardwalk Restaurant for our Hilton Honors Diamond members, although our resort delivered upon the brand standard, I recognize your displeasure that our offering did not include hot items and that you had to pay a fee to upgrade to the full hot breakfast.  We realize how you might perceive this as our shortfall especially when you are extended a full menu at other properties in the Hilton portfolio of brands.  Please know that we are aware of the voice of our guests and are assessing the feasibility of this option.  Nevertheless, as we do empathize with the voice of our guests, we currently offer alternatives to the continental buffet such as using the value of the breakfast voucher at our Surf Hero Market or Henry's Ocean View Dining.   Please know that we do value your loyalty to the Hilton Brand and greatly appreciate your feedback.  Again, please accept our sincere apologies for your disappointment.

In order to correctly answer your denied request for an upgrade, (which Diamond members are eligible for a one tier upgrade based on availability), I would need the exact dates of your stay. During the middle of the January month, we were fully committed with a large conference. Our amenities such as our pools and spa may have had a low occupancy, due to the fact that the attendees were in meetings during the day. It is never our intent to ignore a request as Diamond and Gold members are flagged in our booking system when a Hilton honors number is attached to the reservation; requests are reviewed prior to arrival, and awarded on availability.  Hilton Honors brand standard is that Diamond and Gold members are entitled to two complimentary continental breakfast vouchers at Boardwalk Restaurant / or $15 for up to two people valid at our Surf Hero Market Coffee Shop or Henry's Ocean View Dining, per day of their stay. In regards to it being the bare minimum, please note that it is the standard allotted per Hilton Honor guidelines. We are so sorry to hear that this was disappointment in any way.

The rooms in the Huntington tower are smaller and more dated than the other tower. All the rooms have a view of the ocean but the further towards the road you are, the closer and better your view.

We are sorry to hear that your visit was less than enjoyable. We strive to provide 5 diamond service and are disappointed you did not feel we met this standard. Please note that when you visit any Hilton property as a guest of a conference with a room block; as part of a group rate we are unable to award room upgrades due to the nature of business and contractual agreement. We did however place you on a premium floor within the room type booked as a Diamond Member.   Your observation of the room number assignments is not the case. All of our floors in both the Huntington Tower and Twin Dolphin Tower are arranged in the same order per tower. It is floor number, followed by the room number, with the lowest room number beginning at the room closest to the elevators then proceeding down the hall to the rooms closest to the ocean.  The hospitality definition of ocean front is an ocean view from your windows and inside your room and, if available, balcony. Oceanfront refers to your room directly facing towards the ocean, offering certain room types gorgeous, sweeping views of the Pacific.

The partial view provided a bit of nice shelter while still getting the ocean and pool in.

Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, as we strive to improve with each and every stay. Our staff did place an upgrade on your reservation prior to arrival to the Presidential Suite.

I understand that our Front Office Manager offered different room options to you and your guest upon arrival. I am so sorry these alternatives did not meet your expectations. Please accept our sincerest apologies.  I will say I am puzzled by your statement in regards to the cleanliness of our beach areas. Huntington Beach is known for its pristine beach areas that are cleaned daily. The beaches are tractor combed a few times a week. Our staff participates in multiple beach clean up programs through out the year.

Thank you for helping to keep our beaches clean as we believe it is a collaboration of all to protect and take care of our coastlines, waves and beaches.

The room itself was great. I have to start off saying, I’m comparing this to U.S. 5-star hotels and not higher standard international hotels. In the US., amenities such as slippers are cheaper quality, “ocean view” usually means your view is not completely on the ocean, rather, obstructed by a road and/or parking lot; and finally, the cleanliness isn’t as immaculate as you find internationally.That’s the case with this hotel and all the hotels in the area so I can’t hold it against the hotel.

There are 2 towers and currently one of the pools is being remodeled. It looks like this will be the adult pool. The kids pool is great for families. There’s a shallow entrance for little ones and 2 slides for older kids.  The hotel has tons of beach equipment to rent and it is literally across the street from the beach. It’s like 75% if Hawaii with 25% less travel burdens.  Some of the cons: Since the 2nd pool is currently closed, the main pool was pretty packed.  There were hardly any chairs.  The pool side food is not too expensive but the food is quite mediocre. It would appeal to an 8 year old.

Stayed on the 9th floor of the Twin Dolphin Tower - we could see the beach pretty well from the balcony (kind of a side view vs. straight on but good enough for sure)  We had a small suite; a bedroom w/2 queens, roomy bathroom, and a sitting room. There were pocket sliding doors we could close between the bedroom and sitting and bathroom and that was nice!  Very roomy with good amount of spots for clothing and such - we really didn't feel squished at all (and that's saying something, with 4 of us for a week, one being a teenage girl).

Which is, upon inspection and close review of your folio and our team's input, is what happened here. We simply could not extend your check-out beyond the time we stated to you on the phone.  We understood your desires, and would have hoped to have you understood our needs and the reason explained to you that we could not honor any more delays without a fee...and between the two we did not mesh. I'm sorry for any misunderstanding but on this one, and I rarely say this, I'm going to have say that we really did the best we could do. We wanted to please you and made every effort to do so but obviously it was not good enough.  We wish you the best in all of your travels (sounds fun!) and whether a Hilton or another brand... safe journeys to you and your family for many years to come.

Awesome beach, easy driving to Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Long Beach. Hilton is a nice laid back resort, with a huge pool area, and excellent outdoor dining space. Rooms seemed a little dated but the overall experience was delightful. We walked the Huntington Beach area - nice stroll to the pier, and then to the downtown area one evening for drinks and dinner. It's nice to be able to walk to places.  The lack of self-parking is disappointing, as is the $36/daily fee for the valet.

We make every effort to inform our guests of parking policies for personal vehicles both on our website and via confirmation letter disclosures. As has been discussed many times previously here on TripAdvisor, parking is Valet Only at all the major hotels in the area. There is no overnight parking permitted at the beach and the remainder of parking is either metered (with four hour maximums before you have to resupply the meter) or residential (which is not nearby). We are very limited with capacity and therefore rely upon our valet professionals to park and stage all of our vehicles (including those who work here). We apologize for not having an option to self park, but for liability and safety reasons that is something that is not feasible working within our own limitations.  Please know that we now proudly offer rntal options via Enterprise and have a complimentary shuttle as well. A car would only be absolutely necessary if that is how you were arriving.  We will also pass on your comments regarding service in Shades/Boardwalk. We apologize for any disappointment and look forward to the opportunity to improve upon your next visit.

In fact I paid more than 40 extra for an upper ocean front room and what I got barely qualifies as an ocean view room.  If you strain around the angled balcony you get a glimpse of the ocean.  Nothing like the room that was advertised on their web site or pictured in their advertising.  When I called down to complain I was told be the front desk staff that this was considered ocean front and basically I should be happy that I was away from the construction.  I have stayed in numerous beach front properties in California and Hawaii and never have I seen such an unapologetic attempt at bait and switch.

Everything was wonderful except for the construction, which included the gym. However, passes were available to the gym next door at Pasea.

The valets hustle and are great and so much friendlier than the new front desk staff, and i feel that management could work with them better to figure something out.

Please know that this review is being escalated to the highest levels and all managers and directors will be asked to respond to our GM directly as to how any of this could have happened. The last thing we would ever want is to NOT be the best part of your special day, and we obviously failed you here (even with a comp'd night).  I can assure you, this is not how our hotel operates and there will be extensive follow-up with all of our associates. You did all the right things (letting us know about your wedding at check-in, making requests that were nowhere near unusual or out of bounds, and doing so with grace and kindness) and frankly, we blew it. On behalf of our entire tam, I am truly sorry and will have one of our executive team members reach out to you shortly. We would love the opportunity to make this right by you and earn back your trust and future business.

Unfortunately parking will always be an issue for any resort hotel on the Southern California coastline. With both limited public space and beach operation times that prevent overnight parking (with the exception of campsites) that puts the burden of parking vehicles directly back on to the hotels. Add to that the need to provide security and 24 access for our guests and you can see how this can be quite a challenge.  You are absolutely correct in suggestion a cab/uber/or private shuttle as an alternative. Additionally, our on-site rental rates are competitive with airport rates and thus eliminate the need to bring your vehicle. Unfortunately this only works if you are flying in to us and not driving from a nearby location. Rest assured we feel your pain as we are subject to the same laws and restricted parking areas as locals.

We have reviewed your reservation history and are completely baffled by your disappointment. You specifically requested connecting rooms with an ocean view, which is what we delivered. I can assure you, we ""dupe"" no one and our goal is complete guest satisfaction. We are so sorry to have let you down in some way, but honestly, we're having a hard time making heads or tails of this one. For reference and clarification, there are two main room types that guests sometimes confuse, which may have happened here:   There is ""ocean view"" and ""ocean front"". Ocean front, as the name implies, faces directly out to the ocean and is limited in inventory. Ocean ""front"" rooms only mainly connect to suites and therefore would not have been what you requested (a king room connecting to a double room). In addition, these rooms are considered ""premium"" and would have also been at a significantly higher rate.  For the remainder of our rooms, with few exceptions, they are categorized as ""ocean view"", as they all come with balconies angled at 45 degrees looking out to the ocean. Unless you were on a garden level (and your completed reservation and stay indicates otherwise), you would have had an unobstructed view of the Pacific, as promised.  We care deeply about you and your perception of us and our outstanding staff. Again, we are quite perplexed by your comment and would like to speak to you further about your stay with us.

We believe you may have confused an ocean front room with an ocean view room (as all of our rooms feature balconies facing the ocean at a 45 degree angle and with rare exceptions have a clear view of the ocean). Ocean front rooms are just like they sound, facing directly toward the Pacific and are limited in inventory much like our suites.  We would also like to clear up a few questions you seem to have regarding parking, late check-outs and roll-aways (and information about our very good friends at the Hyatt next door). There is no self parking, either here or next door at The Hyatt. Both hotels are valet only for both convenience and liability issues. It is simply the nature of the beast in a resort area and clearly stated on all of our websites, including pricing (the Hyatt is $35, by the way). Check-out time is noon at both hotels and, when available, we are happy to accomodate a later check-out at no charge (if possible depending upon occupancy levels). Otherwise we offer a later check-out to 3pm for $50 if you so desire. Hilton Diamond members are offered complimentary late check out (again, if possible) upon request as well. There is a onetime fee for a rollaway bed, but it looks as tho that was comp'd for you as well.   Our hotel offers many a'la carte options for our guests (and presently has no resort fee as result) so never hesitate to ask us prior to arrival if you have any questions.

We did a bit of checking on what you indicated in your review (related to pricing) and our records noted that you booked thru central reservations over the phone with Hilton Worldwide and not the hotel directly. This would never effect the pricing for any of our rooms (since Hilton Worldwide Central Reservations or calling us here on property direct have exactly the same pricing...which is ALWAYS lower than any other online resource including third party ""discount"" sites). It would, however, sometimes effect a room description since a Worldwide agent only has brief descriptions of rooms all over the world and our in-house agents have much more detailed knowledge of the property here. We noted that you were moved to a suite instead of the originally booked ocean front room for a minimal charge ($20 USD) but we were happy to accommodate your request. Our sincere apologies for any confusion regarding your room upon check-in and we are glad we could accommodate your request for a suite.  As for the problems or attitude you encountered from any of our staff, we will look deeper into this and make any and all adjustments necessary. As referenced over and over on this review site by countless other guests, our staff is one of our strongest assets and we take great pride in this.

The parking attendants are very friendly and helpful.  They gave us bottles of water to take with us every time we took the car out of the lot.  Check in went well.  However, one of the rooms had such a foul odor, we had to go back to the front desk to change rooms.  It appeared that someone horrible was spilled on the carpet, which was still soaking wet and some horrible chemical was used to try and clean it.

It is true that there is no self parking at any resort on the coast anymore (it is both a space AND liability issue that we simply have to manage) but you do have options, even when you are staying here on business.  Don't drive here in your personal vehicle if that's possible for you. Take a shuttle or taxi. Then, while here, arrange for a car via the concierge at rates that are no higher then those you will find at the airport. You have a car when you need it, a FREE shuttle downtown with  us anytime you want a ride, and no pesky parking charges. Additionally, you can find stay packages on our website that include parking (and breakfast and internet!). That is probably our most popular option for our guests.   Additionally, sign up for Hilton Honors and recieve TONS of benefits that sometimes include COMP parking at various properties and resorts. Get those points racked up and even your stay is free!  Valet-only is an unfortunate reality that, as innkeepers, we loathe as much as you. I don't like hearing about it all the time either, but it is the only solution to an overcrowded, lawsuit happy world we have to manage.

That said, so long as you are a responsible pet owner (and it sounds like you sure are!), you can use any green space around the hotel. We don't have a designated space, per se. We trust you and your buddy to decide what works, so long as it is outside and on a green space.

We work very hard to make sure that from check-in to check-out, everything you see and everyone you encounter meets or exceeds your expectations.   Parking at most hotels on the coast is valet only. We are very limited on space and thus cannot offer self parking. We have made a conscious decision to NOT have a resort fee of any kind and to allow 24 hour in/out privileges and service for this very reason. I have mentioned in other posts options that you have other than driving in to us to save on valet parking, the best being to take a shuttle or taxi to us and then let us drive you downtown or you can rent a car for day use from the concierge! No parking needed.  We do offer complimentary internet access in the lobby via our Connectivity Center (with both Apple and Windows based computers) complete with free printing! WiFi is optional for our guests both in room and around the resort. Trust me, there is no such thing as ""free"" WiFi.

We have researched your reservation and located the room during your stay. Both GM and the Director of Engineering are currently conducting a full inspection of your former guestroom. Being that we have no guestrooms above our restaurant (our tower is opposite any dining, meeting, or group function space) it is most likely that you were hearing our outside acoustic guitarist who plays around the fire pit. We always stop the music by 10pm, but to be certain we have also dispatched a notice to our Director of Restaurants to make sure that policy is being followed. We apologize for any disturbance.  I researched both weather and oceanic conditions during your stay to see if that may have been a contributing factor in any way to the smell you encountered in the room. Occasionally, especially if a slider door is left open all night and either an upwelling or red tide condition is in effect (combined with an onshore breeze), one can detect the distinct smell of the open ocean.

I take some reasonability because I knew the hotel allowed animals but didn't know they would be on any floor.  I was unlucky enough to be next door to a small dog that barked when the owners left him, and down the hall were three large dogs in one room.

It is always a challenge to manage crowds of that size, so we go out of our way to secure the hotel for you, the guest, and close the property to outsiders.   Also, I'm not sure why you didn't know that we DO have a free shuttle for downtown use? However, if this was something needed on the 4th of July, then we didn't deploy the shuttle and informed our guests of the road closures. All hotels in the area (including the Hyatt) were asked by the Huntington Beach Police Department to stay off the already congested roads in and around our downtown shopping district and we felt it wise in the interest of safety as well. Beach towels and complimentary beach chairs are always available at the pool hut for you to take over to the ocean. Just sign them out and you're on your way! Again, because the crowds were so large and the demand so high, we felt it best to restrict this service to the pool area on the 4th.  We hope that you do give us another opportunity to showcase our hotel for you. And please never hesitate to ask any question or report any issue or concern to our outstanding staff. If there is a way to make it right, we're all over it!  Sincerely,  Scott O'Hanlon Director of Marketing The Waterfront Beach Resort, a Hilton Hotel",none,none,none,none,none,none,2316,77

Friendly mostly very young staff give the hotel a welcoming and laid back vibe. There was mostly families at the poolside, many with young kids. Nevertheless it was very relaxing to hangout. The negatives are mostly with poor housekeeping, the rooms are quite dirty, and the crazy stupid breakfast which is expensive, poor and badly organised.

Cleanliness, efficiency and friendliness are all huge compliments, so thank you for that!

In order to provide consistent, secure, 24 hour parking services, ""valet"" is our only option.

Biggest disadvantage - you pay for the beautiful view with an incredible noise level. The street in front of the hotel kills about 50% of the romantic sunset. When there are constructions going on in the hotel (incl. air hammers) - which were not announced on the website when booking and a new surface going in on the street than another 50% of your 50% left over romatnic is gone. But I guess that was just a bad time for me and my wife.  I read about the extremly friendly staff - absolutly right for the front desk! For most of the others (specially at breakfast) - I guess it was just a bad time! (irony!) I think for the value you get it is overpriced.

I was very sorry to hear that you were not completely happy with your guestroom accommodations. You might be interested in knowing that only the top two floors of the hotel have the laminate wood flooring. We added the flooring to give the rooms a more authentic Huntington Beach ""bungalow"" look and feel (the beach bungalow homes being one of the most historic features of our fair city), but you certainly do not have to have a room with wood flooring.

We can even provide “beach butler” service and start a beach bonfire for you at night too (great for making Smores or just admiring the fire with an incredible sunset for a back drop). Waterfront Adventures is located directly across from the hotel on the beach proper and can accommodate guests and non-guests alike with surf lessons, bike rentals, beach chairs, fire pits, food & fun & more!  One more secret I can share with you is about crowds and pricing. If I'm not mistaken you sound as if you prefer a more serene atmosphere with a surfside ambiance. Thus, after the summer season ends (Labor Day) and the kiddies are all back in school, the resort offers incredible packages and deals that will knock your socks off! Be sure to look on our Waterfront Resort website or call us directly and we can tell you what is available. From packages that include parking and internet to romantic stays or breakfasts in bed, the best deals can be had while the weather at the beach is still spectacular…and with school ""in"" it’s the perfect time for and adult beverage and book by the pool. If it fits within your schedule, this kind of stay truly is one of the best kept secrets around.  I hope this encourages you to return to Huntington Beach soon and , should you return to the hotel, please ask for me personally so that I may introduce myself. I want to make sure you are well cared for and that your next stay creates all the ""wows"" we can muster!  Sincerely,  Scott O'Hanlon Direct",none,none,none,none,none,none,2503,77

I was made aware of your issue soon after it had been reported to our Director of Risk Management and I am sincerely sorry that we were unable to immediately resolve this incident to your satisfaction. I can assure you that the safety and security of our guests (and their personal belongings) are of the utmost priority here at the resort and all Hilton Hotels world-wide. In fact, the Hilton Corporation several years ago mandated that every guest be provided with access to either a personal in-room safe (or a secure safety box area) at no charge to you, the guest. The Waterfront also has many more safety and security measures in place including fully monitored and video surveillance of the property, electronic key entry and muti-lock guestroom doors, state of the art fire suppression and alarm systems, mandated and ongoing safety and security training for all of our associates, and much more.  Additionally, we are also bound by the laws of the city, county, and State of California and as such, without positive proof a loss has occurred or a crime has been committed, we cannot make any false accusations in any direction. In a case such as yours, we strongly encourage you to file a report with the Huntington Beach Police Department, with whom we work very closely. You can reach the HBPD at 714.960.8811. If you have insurance covering personal belongings, be sure to file a claim with them as well.   We will continue to vigilantly watch for your missing MP3 player to turn up and promptly notify you when it does. In the past we have been able to return lost computers, phones, jewelry, loose diamonds, cash... you name it, we've found it and returned it! Personally, I know how much a music or data player can mean to someone, so I will be sure to follow up with our Director of Risk Management as well and check on the progress of his team’s search.  In the meantime, feel free to call upon me here at the hotel and let me know if there is any other assistance I may provide. I am at your service.

Many of our guests, such as yourself, were either directly or indirectly impacted by the events that transpired at our pool, and we want to apologize for the offensive behavior of the attendees at the ""Therapy Sunday"" pool party.  The initial presentation of the event by the event management company was for it to be an upscale pool party with high energy, but with a sophisticated crowd to include our hotel guests, so that our guests could enjoy the experience.  Obviously this was not the case and it quickly turned into a disaster which goes against our image and reputation as a family friendly destination and as a Hilton property.

The rooms were nice and clean and just about every room at the hotel has a view of the ocean.  It is much smaller than the Hyatt so it is less crowded at the pool, hotel and beach area in front of the Hilton.  When we were on the beach we looked down toward the Hyatt, which is next door, and the beach directly in front of the Hyatt was packed.  The nightime bonfires are in front of the Hilton and the Hilton is closer to the Peir, restaurants, and shopping.

11 helpful votes,7 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Location,We just stayed there for Easter weekend. My husband surfs and we enjoy the HB easy going fun night life so you cant beat the location.  The rooms were very clean and the front desk very helpful. They are able to get us into our room before 12 noon!  I was a little disappointed in the Turn Down service. They took the wet towels but didn't replace them so we had to call for more and they didn't tidy anything up. I guess I'm used to a different level of Turn Down service. O well mabe I'm just picky but that bothered me. The valet and concierge were excellent.  We had lunch at the poolside restaurant and it was lovely. Everything was wonderful. No poolside waiters maybe because of the time of year. I have been here during the summer and there was music and fun going on.

We were both impressed with this hotel.  The room was large, along with a nice sized bathroom, and the bed was extremely comfortable.  We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with the ""thin wall"" complaint others have posted.  I guess it's a possibility we just didn't end up with people in the rooms next to us, in that case we were lucky!  During our stay, we did hear a few people mention that the tower rooms are not worth the extra price, so it might be a good idea to stay away from those.  We specifically asked for a ""high up"" room, and ended up with a great ocean view, as well.  Overall, the hotel has a beautiful, high-class look and feel to it.  I believe we paid around $160 through priceline.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2751,77

On arrival at check in, the receptionist congratulated us immediately on our wedding, and simply couldnt be more friendly. She told us we had a lovely room, and what a gorgeous suprise to find we had been upgraded to a oceanfront king deluxe. The room was beautiful, with two balconies. Everything was spotlessly clean and very well presented. An hour or so after arrival, a bell boy arrived with some chocolates and a card from the front desk asking if we wanted anything at all to let them know. I thought this was most sweet. The room was also very quiet, we heard no other guests in corridors, adjoining",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2752,77
8 helpful votes,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible poolside service. but nice hotel,"Very nice and clean Hilton.  Hotel location is great, about 2 minute walk to the beach.  The rooms were clean, but small beds if you request double beds.  Just one pool, not so big.  Poolside service was just terrible because they were understaffed.  It took an hour and a half to get drinks, and that's after many complaints.  Room service was not so good.  If you are planning to use the tennis courts: Good Luck!

The staff was extremely helpful.  I actually enjoyed the five-ten minute walk into town for dinner.  Relaxing and good way to walk off a meal.  HB is full of some cool eateries.  Newport is just down the road.  That was a fun place to hang out.  The pier is a blast at night.  Great people watchng - felt totally safe.  Only negative I had was that the hotel was noisy after hours.  I heard doors slamming at all hours which bummed me out.  At first I shrugged it off as just famalies with kids on vacation having a good time but at 2:00 AM?  All in all I enjoyed the Hilton - how can you not be jacked about waking up every morning with that view?,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2754,77

I did not eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on the food.  The bar is large and quite nice with excellent service.  The facilities and grounds are incredible.  The pool is very large with excellent service and very clean.  The rooms are at least average sized and quite comfortable.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  My meeting plans changed and the staff were able to extend my stay even while the hotel was sold out during the Pro Surfing tournament.  There are a few pigeons that sit on the balconies but I saw no droppings.  The pier and downtown HB is within walking distance if you are under the age of 75.  It's maybe a 15 minute walk.

We stayed there because we wanted to be close to the beach, but it's actually very easy to park along the beaches there and a lot of money could be saved staying somewhere else.

They were advertised as offering you utter privacy, and breakfast in a private lounge are included in the price.  It was a disappointment.  The lounge is small and not welcoming to kids because of the way the table and chairs are set up.  There are always men in their 50's and 60's sitting there reading their papers during breakfast looking real serious that you feel the need to whisper when you need to talk during breakfast. The breakfast selection is limited and there is a concierge sitting there watching you having breakfast which can be quite uncomfortable.

I've stayed at, among other Hilton hotels, the Palmer House in Chicago, Capital Hilton in Wash DC, and Hilton Torrey Pines in San Diego. This is probably the best Hilton I've ever stayed in. I was there with my family from 13-16 July. I really can't think of anything negative to say. I know people were in the rooms next to me, yet I had no problem with noice in the rooms, and I'm very sensitive to that. Noise in the hallways is another story, but that's a hit on the insensitive boors who stayed there. You can check out boogie boards and beach chairs to take to the beach across the street.
