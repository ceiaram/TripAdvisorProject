The decor in the room looked like it was straight from the 50’s-70’s.  You’re either going to think it’s cool or scratch your head in disbelief. I straddled the fence on that decision, but hey, I was renting not buying.   I arrived in the afternoon and to my surprise, the office was closed.  A poor first impression.  But soon enough, someone showed up and checked me into my room.  There are like only 6 rooms in the whole place so I’m not sure why they need an office. Staff was pleasant and helpful.   I spent two nights here.  There is a lot of street noise but I slept ok.  There are a couple of good restaurants within walking distance and a pub two doors down.",April 2019,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,452

You can’t beat the price being in Southern California. Over all friendly, clean, and unique. 5 stars.",March 2018,"Clean, friendly, and unique.

A little noise from the highway. Nothing fancy but very hospitable. About 17 mins walk to Califia Beach. 5 mins drive from San Clemente Pier .",August 2018,none,Traveled with friends,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,452

It is a no frills place but I soon discovered that it had a lot going for it. The location is great. It's on a Main Street, and next door to a small grocery store. It is also across the street from the ocean. And while the rooms are small and pretty dated, we don't ever spend much time in the room while we are on vacation.But the very best thing about the C-Vu isJared, the manager. He is amazing. Very friendly and helpful. Anything we needed, including directions and restaurant recommendations, hairdryer etc. It is a funky little place but it is an experience I won't forget, as it was unexpectedly positive!",July 2018,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,452
