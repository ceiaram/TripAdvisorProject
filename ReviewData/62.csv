Breakfast with the same offerings each morning. Tasty but ultimately boring after a few days.

Clearly, we fell short of your expectations, and on behalf of our entire team, I sincerely apologize for this.    We realize that guests who have been coming to the property for years, may have difficulty getting use to the new upgrades and amenities. We fully restored the property to keep all of the historical integrity that guests have come to love, however also updated and redesigned the property in order to provide a more relevant and full-service experience. We engaged celebrity designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard to oversee the renovation and help make Casa Laguna into Laguna Beach’s first luxury boutique property.   We completely understand that it might be difficult to get use to some of the new amenities and offerings of the hotel. As you noted, while many items in the past might have been given away complimentary, those amenities were not of the highest quality. Due to the feedback of guests, we chose to offer a much higher standard of amenities and have guests pay on a per-consumption basis. This is typical of most luxury properties in the area.   While we understand that it might be difficult to get use to some of the changes, we do want to let you know we are proud to offer a lot of new amenities and features that guests have come to love and found as a vast improvement, including an in-room mini bar, full service food and beverage program offered throughout the day and night, room and pool service, upscale beer and wine offerings, Cow Shed bath amenities, and fully renovated guest rooms by Martyn Lawrence Bullard.

If it's about the quality of experience, then I'd give the hotel more stars. What it does (sweet little boutique hotel with excellent staff and exceptionally good food), it does well.    But Tripadvisor asks for an overall rating of the hotel, which for me reflects the quality of the hotel itself.

We would recommend that prospective guests reading this forum peruse our many 5-star reviews, nearly all of which praise our superb guest-first customer service.

The credit was issued on standard letter-sized paper clearly printed with an expiration date and a statement that the document number must be presented at time of making reservation, that the reservation must be made directly by phone, and that the original credit must be presented upon arrival. She does not mention in her review that she was advised upon arrival that the credit had expired and that she began to vehemently insist that it cannot expire under California law – which is the case for certain Gift Certificates but not for a credit issued to her as a courtesy even though our guidelines state that no credit will be given for a no-show, regardless of the reason. The credit she received was given as a courtesy and was clearly not a gift certificate. When we make a rare exception and issue a credit for a no-show, we expect that the guest will follow the instructions on the document and use it before it expires. To allow otherwise would simply open us up to abuse. It was this guest’s decision to go ahead with her stay despite being advised that the credit had expired and that the terms of the credit had not been followed.

Many of our returning guests have standing reservations for our “artist rooms,” so called because they retain the small size and quaint style of the original 1946 motel-- with modern upgrades and amenities of course. We encourage prospective guests to read about all of our rooms on our website, which will also provide detailed information about our outdoor soak tub and other spa services. We do not have a Jacuzzi at Casa Laguna because communal hot tubs are notoriously unsanitary and promote boisterous activity not fitting with the tranquil, romantic ambiance of our property. The ocean-view, by-reservation-only garden spa tub mentioned by David B is designed to provide a semi-private therapeutic soak for one or two individuals, in water infused with detoxifying Himalayan Sea Salt. The water is freshly drawn for each soak after the tub is fully cleaned and sanitized. Most of our guests feel that the resulting comfort and ambiance--and hygienic assurance--is worth the nominal fee charged for this spa service. Again, we thank David B for his fair and balanced review, which gave us this opportunity to address his criticisms and enlighten prospective guests.",none,none,none,none,none,none,555,62

But for the benefit of prospective guests reading this forum we do need to address some of the negatives listed that are so very untypical when compared to the majority of our reviews. As we have said so many times, we readily admit that we are not a perfect fit for everyone and clearly this couple would have preferred a larger, full-service resort instead of a small boutique inn. Many of the things they complained about (or were indifferent about) are the exact things most of our many fans love about our inn. Our grounds fell a bit flat: Visitors from around the world compare our grounds to the finest terraced gardens of Spain and Italy.  Courtyard room is expensive: Compared to local hotels and resorts it is not only inexpensive, it also includes amenities you would pay for at other hotels in the form of resort fees, including a breakfast nearly every guest raves about. The two main windows in each Courtyard rooms are 3x4 feet and look out on a bright cheery garden terrace. Breakfasts ordinary: We know of no hotel in all of California, nor the parts of England we’ve been to, that provides a menu of 6 gourmet entrees, plus sides and fruit and pastry and a drink bar at absolutely no additional charge. We call that extraordinary, and so do the majority of our guests. Pool area small: Our pool area is actually very large for a 22-room boutique hotel. Only family-oriented bustling big-box resorts have larger pools. WiFi temporarily down: All the money in the world can’t buy a WiFi system that never fails. Paying in cash: In the United States and many parts of the world, nearly all hotels require a credit card at check-in for incidentals. It is understood that services not paid for at the time of service will be charged to the card. Most guests find this a convenience and almost no one pays with cash—although we do make every effort to make that happen on those occasions where the guest lets us know in advance and does not later change their mind. We have previously mentioned a hotel/restaurant phenomenon called “following the leader,” where patrons pick an establishment because of its customer ranking, without truly looking at all the photos and descriptions on the website to see if the rooms, services, food, etc. are truly the type they are looking for.

I would not recommend anyone to book at this place; they decide who stays and who doesn't.  I am now booked at the St Regis Monarch Beach (thanks for cancelling by the way!)",May 2014,none,none,"Although this post states that it relates to a couple who stayed with us in May 2014, this is not the case. The individual writing this post (hereinafter “the traveler”) did not stay with us. In fact, we had almost no contact with him throughout the booking process, despite many efforts to reach him. After the initial booking was made, we began to receive a series of requests for unusual high-end add-ons, such as arranging dinner on the beach and limousine pick-up from LAX, all which were to be charged to the traveler’s room. As a small inn, these are not services we provide, and if we did provide them, we would certainly require payment up front.  My front desk associate attempted to contact the traveler in order to discuss the many requests and this was the point at which we discovered the phone number provided was not that of the traveler, but rather a supposed travel agent in Texas who was unable to give us any information about the traveler. I then directed my front desk associate to contact American Express to make sure the card was not stolen. After explaining the circumstances, he was transferred to a Fraud Specialist who advised him that the situation warranted strong consideration as attempted fraud. The specialist took a full report and then made it very clear that if we held the reservation with the traveler and any fraud were to take place, then Casa Laguna, not American Express, would be liable. Based on everything that occurred up to that point, we then cancelled the reservation and continued to attempt to reach the traveler, without success. We later received a phone call from an individual identifying himself as the cardholder. We advised him that, if he could provide the correct personal information to match the credit card, and if American Express gave us authorization, we could reinstate the booking. The person on the phone stated that he wasn’t sure he still wanted to stay with us and we advised him that was certainly up to him.   I later received an email from the traveler saying that he was prepared to write bad reviews about our inn, but first wanted to know the details of why we cancelled his reservation and what we were going to do for him. A more detailed version of the information provided in this reply was sent to him by return email. We can only assume that he actually received it since there was no further communication.  This may well have been nothing more than a misunderstanding resulting from lack of communication. We will probably never know. It is highly unlikely this traveler would have been happy staying at our inn, since we could not provide him with all the extras he wanted. However, we did not simply decide to cancel the traveler’s reservation as he claims. We cancelled his reservation based on established industry standards and the advice of American Express Fraud Division. Most travelers are not aware that American Express has the most rigid standards in the industry for charges made by phone, mail, or email. Also, we have been the victims of credit card fraud on more than a few occasions in recent years. Thus, the staff and management of Casa Laguna spend many hours verifying information and making sure standards are met so that we do not incur charge-backs that greatly affect our ability to remain competitive in this crowded industry.   Finally, we resent any implication that we discriminate in any way.

The breakfast was yummy, we tried the special omelet and the gingerbread waffle.  The Inn is charming - built in the 1920s and 100 years ago luxury didn't mean anything close to what it means in 2014. We had a deluxe oceanview king room. the room was claustrophobic! A king size bed shouldn't even be an option here. It took nearly 15 minutes to get hot water in the shower. The linens on the bed were soft & lovely, but the bed itself was somewhat uncomfortable.  And even though the terse notes in the Inn's literature made us feel like teenagers on Spring break, we would have been embarrassed to even think about enjoying sex since the foot traffic outside the front window was",February 2014,none,none,"I first want to thank Bellauno for mentioning those things he/she liked about our inn. Now, for clarification, and for the benefit of prospective guests, I need to respond to Bellauno’s many negative comments.  -Reviews: We caution prospective guests not to make a reservation for any hotel or restaurant based entirely on their excellent reviews.  90% of the guests who stay at Casa Laguna love Casa Laguna and that keeps us rated in the top two hotels for Laguna Beach and often for all of Orange County. But, as Bellauno suggests, we are not for everyone—especially those who are expecting a bustling family-style resort with valet parking and mid-sized cookie cutter rooms with catalog furniture. Those who do their research and actually read our reviews will arrive informed and unsurprised. Prospective guests should peruse our website—especially the room descriptions that actually list the square footage for each room type. This would have been of great help to Bellauno. Luxury: Last year Casa Laguna was chosen by bedandbreakfast.com as one of the Top 10 Luxury Inns in the World. We also received Trip Advisor’s Travelers' Choice award as a Top 25 Small Hotel and Top 10 Hotel for Romance in the United States. Despite Bellauno’s analysis, apparently the experts think we’re a little nicer than the Casa Laguna Motel of 1946.  Beds: Our guest rave about our cloudlike beds, not just the bedding. But we agree somewhat with Bellauno about King beds, thus we only have a few rooms with King beds for those who just won’t accept anything else. Need a larger room? We’ve got them. Just ask. Or better yet, check them all out in advance on our website. Intimacy: I’ve never stayed in any hotel where I didn’t hear people and children in the hall and in the rooms next door. Doors slamming, rooms service carts crashing, and icemakers thumping. You’ll hear almost none of that at Casa Laguna. We want Bellauno to know that hundreds of children have been conceived at Casa Laguna. We know, because their parents often return to celebrate. Casa Laguna is all about romance. If someone complaints about the noise of lovemaking (that’s happened maybe twice) we suggest they take a stroll and come back when it quiets down. (If the noise is late-night, continuous, or recurring, we certainly might make a discreet call to let them know, as would any hotel.) Parking: Here we go again. Our parking spaces are exactly the same size as those in a typical grocery store parking lot. They are far larger than those typically found in the garages of many bustling hotels and family-style resorts. Some people are unduly afraid of the support poles on either side of each space. The answer is simple…swing out wide and go straight in, just like you would between two cars in a hotel parking garage. If you go in at an angle, of course you’re going to scrape something. Full size Hummers have parked there and we can provide the photos to prove it. Location: There are hotels downtown for those who, like Bellauno, want to be within walking distant of the noisy bustling heart of the city. We are in an upscale residential neighborhood just one block from fine restaurants and just 1.5 miles from downtown Laguna Beach shops, eateries, art galleries, and summer art festivals. And, there is public transportation right outside our door—we’ll pay for a round trip on Laguna Transit. Traffic: Like nearly every major hotel and restaurant in Laguna Beach we are on Pacific Coast Highway. It is the only way to get from one beach town to another. Bellauno is right--it sometimes gets busy. Price: Bellauno got a free gourmet breakfast chosen from a menu of items, free parking, free evening wine reception, and most importantly, he/she paid no resort fees like they would have at most of the bustling family-style resorts.  And finally, because we are a closed compound, open only to registered guests, we only give a peek to those who have done their research and are seriously interested in enjoying a stay in our lovely, historic, award-winning boutique hotel.",none,none,none,none,none,none,641,62

She promptly decided to leave a one-star rating of our hotel after talking on the phone with one of our guest service associates. I immediately contacted Nalistar to apologize for the situation as soon as I was made aware, but she had already posted this declaration of dissatisfaction. I was not present when the described telephone conversation with our associate took place. But I have heard the specified associate handle many such calls and I have never heard him be uncaring or impolite. That said, it is clear that he failed to handle the discussion with Nalistar in accordance with our established policies and procedures, for which I again apologize. In particular, our associate should have offered Nalistar credit for a future stay, which is our standard policy in cases of emergency cancellation. I personally offered this credit to Nalistar and she refused to accept it. It is clear from the final sentence of her statement that she feels the actions of one hotel associate on one occasion undoubtedly mirrors the quality and character of the entire hotel.

Being from Australia we had no idea how noisy & busy the Pacific Coast Highway was nor that the property fronted straight onto it. Whilst we were checking in we soon came to understand the implications of being on this road - it was so noisy with the door open in reception we could hardly hear what was being said to us! We were allocated room 5 - it was very comfortable and clean and had a lovely large bath, plus a balcony, however we were not able to have the door open as the road noise was too intrusive.

It’s a rare occurrence, especially among our large following of Aussie friends who typically rave about their time with us. It appears that Deb H had three complaints, which we’ll address in order. 1. Road noise. Please read my response to “Too Noisy for Me,” below. Earplugs are provided for those who are particularly noise sensitive and few guests find them necessary. All room windows and sliding glass doors on the highway side of the property are in-fact double pane. Deb H’s room was not adjacent to the highway, but next to a residential street that gets minimal traffic.  2. Breakfast times. Guests do not have to book a time for breakfast nor make a reservation. The purpose of asking what time a guest would like seating – available in half-hour increments over three hours—is not to fit with the needs of the staff, but to assure that every guest has a wider choice of seating and receives prompt service. All guests are advised that they can simply call down and adjust the time if their plans change. This system is in-fact quite flexible and is standard-of-the-industry for many bed & breakfast inns. 3. Late checkout. Like most every hotel in the world, Casa Laguna has a clearly posted check-out time and a check-in time that allows for a period of cleaning and resetting rooms for the next round of arriving guests. However, we are not a huge resort with cleaning staff available throughout the day. Allowing a guest to stay in a room beyond the reserved period would mean that the room would not be available on time for arriving guests. Our Guest Service Representative advised this couple that we would hold their luggage in secure storage and they could stay on the property—enjoying the pool and patios-- until time to depart for the airport. She even offered to let them use our spa shower if they needed it later in the day. We believe this compromise was in fitting with our award-winning guest-first service, and was over and above what would be provided by the typical resort or big-box hotel. We sincerely apologize if our policies and procedures were not sufficiently explained to this couple through our website, through the many emails we sent throughout the process in advance of their stay, or by our staff at check-in. We are so sorry their sensitivity to highway sounds made their stay less than perfect. And we hope they were at least able to enjoy and appreciate our beautiful grounds and the award-winning food, services, and amenities our guests rave about.",none,none,none,none,none,none,689,62

We note that noise is the sole topic of this review, and thus we think it is important to respond accordingly. The subject of road noise has become a self-perpetuating concern, so that some guests walk onto the property listening for the noise others have mentioned. All hotels have ambient noise. We personally have never stayed in a major hotel or resort where we were not constantly barraged by the sound of children running down the hallways and/or spring-loaded room doors slamming shut 24 hours a day. We have never stayed in an urban hotel where we did not hear the sound of traffic and sirens. Laguna’s ocean- front hotels even get complaints about sleepless nights due to the roaring waves. We are being absolutely honest when we say that the road noise described by willpowern does not represent a significant ongoing annoyance for the majority of our guests. We can only hope that willpowern was able to enjoy at least some of the many features and amenities that our satisfied guests have mentioned in our 500+ five-star reviews, such as spectacular food, beautiful tranquil terraced gardens, relaxing ocean view patios, and cloudlike beds that are truly heavenly. There are, of course, a number of essentially quiet B&Bs we can suggest that are set back in the woods in the mountains, although we’re pretty sure none of them have the service and amenities that make Casa Laguna one of the most award winning-Inns in Southern California.

However, we suggest that travelers always employ the “best practice” of doing a little online research with booking sites before you book any hotel, just to be sure. Wine preference is subjective and, thankfully, the majority of our guests love our wine selection—some even requesting to purchase wine to take home, for which, unfortunately, we are not licensed.

We have always been honest in admitting that those who are particularly anxious about road sounds might not want to stay in any hotel that sits on PCH—which, unfortunately, would be the majority of South Coast hotels. But a sampling of our reviews—and those of other PCH-adjacent accommodations--will confirm that hundreds of coastal guests do not find it a significant problem.

Casa Laguna has 10 different room types, ranging from full suites to quant little “artist” rooms. Our returning guests tend to stick with a favorite, and for some that would be the Newport and Balboa “junior” suites, due primarily to the larger overall space compared to a standard room, including a sitting area, and a king bed. We are at a loss to understand why the room would have been warm with the AC set to 69 degrees. This is not something we’ve experienced, nor received previous complaints about. Every room is thoroughly cleaned and refreshed between guests, and that includes the use of an eco-friendly “odor suppressor.” Our experience has been that any related odor goes away in a matter of minutes. It is possible that the room had residual odor from some product used by the previous guest. If this was the case, we certainly dropped the boat in not identifying the odor and taking care of it. Fewer and fewer guests are using the remaining in-room kitchen facilities that are still available in only three of our suites. It is highly likely that we will be eliminating them in the not-to-distant future.

First our towel bar was loose it kept falling apart. We were also annoyed by the alarm clock that went off all night we unplugged it but i guess it ran on batteries so we took it to the front desk. The second night we saw a huge roach on our wall. It was huge! We killed it told the front desk they said it was normal due to all their plants on property so it's common to them. If they did proper pest control outside they shouldnt be so common! We found very small marijuana leaves on the chair. We made a good time of our stay even though it wasn't perfect. We thought they would care more about our dissapointments because they were all nice but they did nothing to compensate for the bad experiences,August 2013,none,none,"First of all, we want Jbaj08 to know that we are so sorry they encountered some difficulties while visiting our inn and we are glad they were able to enjoy much of their stay. Despite every effort to remind prospective guests that concerns should be reported to the front desk immediately, we continue to find out about them at check-out or in reviews, which of course is far too late for us to correct the problem. Most grievances listed in this review could have been immediately ameliorated had they been reported to us at the time they are discovered. At this point we can only respond to each criticism, so that prospective guests reading this are aware that these issues are not normal or common. 1. Because the bathroom in question was recently remodeled, it is possible the rack may not have been tightened sufficiently. A call to the front desk at any time day or night would have solved the issue before it became a problem. 2. The same is true for the alarm, which had been left set by the previous guest. Had we been informed when the guest first noticed the problem, we would have come to their room and flipped the switch that turns off the alarm, and advised the guest that what they were hitting was the snooze button. 3. Every Laguna Beach hotel of any type or stature has bugs. Those like Casa Laguna, with lush gardens and greenery surrounding every building, have more than their share of six-legged visitors. Our property is monitored by Orkin, who performs regular eradication using eco-friendly systems that are proven effective. Because we are a certified wildlife habitat and Monarch way-station, we do not use strong poisons that harm the eco-system. 4. We cannot speak to any leaves found in the room as we did not see them. 5. It is not the policy of Casa Laguna (or most hotels) to issue refunds due to minor issues that could have been resolved or avoided by timely communication with the front desk. 6. Our Theraputic Soak Tub is not a Jacuzzi. It is a spa experience and is listed, with pricing, in our Spa brochure and on our website. It must be booked in advance and guests are asked if they would like to include Champagne in the cost of the therapeutic soak, which should indicate that it is not complimentary. 7. Not all rooms at Casa Laguna have an ocean view. Complete room descriptions are provided on our website, including whether or not the room you are considering has an ocean view. Again, we sincerely apologize that this guest felt disappointed with their stay. We hope that, as a result of reading of this review and respone, travelers are reminded that wherever they stay, they should immediately bring any issue they encounter to the attention of management so that the situation can be remedied before it affects the pleasure of their stay.",none,none,none,none,none,none,713,62

Only one Patio Room and one Courtyard Room has a King bed--the rest of those room-types have Queens. As a result of Beale_St_Sam’s comment, we are currently running numbers on how many requests we get for a smaller room type with a King bed, and we may indeed change one or more out for queens. Should this guest decide to return to Casa Laguna in the interim, they should be aware that we have 10 room types with a choice of King and Queen beds in most room types.

It was courteously explained to PJ that we had a full house and that the previous guests had not even vacated the room, after which we would require time for cleaning. This was at the height of our breakfast service, and all tables both indoors and on our outdoor service patio were occupied.

Here's the good: Exceptional two",November 2012,none,none,"Even though it is clear that Casa Laguna was not a good fit for this couple, we appreciate Lynne L taking the time to share her opinions. When we see a review with these types of criticisms that is totally out of line with our typical reviews, we know that the guest would have been better suited to a beachfront big-box resort with a bellman and an expansive room with matching laminated contemporary furniture. As anyone can tell from reading a few of our 412 5-star reviews, that’s not Casa Laguna.  Responding to the Cons in order: All of our guests receive a warm welcome followed by a personal tour of the property as they are escorted to their room. Nick has been a Guest Service Associate with us for many years and is well-versed in Casa Laguna’s acclaimed guest-first service concept. We have never seen him be anything other than friendly, polite, and responsive to guest’s needs. The spa issue occurred because the guest did not ask for a particular online special package in advance, a requirement that is clearly stated in the package description. As is the standard of our industry, these specials and packages are intended to incentivize guests to book with us, and it would be counterproductive to apply this special package pricing to everyone who requests it after arrival. This guest became angry and confrontational when Nick stood his ground on the issue, which we would presume to be the cause for their criticisms of him.  Each arriving guest receives a “welcome basket” containing fruit, cookies, and water. Water and fruit are replaced each day during linen service. There would, of course, be no such replacement on the final day prior to checkout. However, in any case, the guest need only call the front desk to request any of those items (within reason) and they would be delivered post-haste.  Regarding room size/décor, the balcony, and our sprawling ocean views, I would refer the reader to our recent prior reviews and to the photos on our website. We do not represent that we have private balconies, and guests rave about our Catalina sunset views.  We serve our full gourmet breakfast for three hours each morning—7am to 10am.  Since 11am is check-out time, and since guests who are not checking out are usually heading out by 11am to enjoy their day, we do not see the need to extend breakfast service. Casa Laguna’s chef and breakfast was recently praised in a NY Times article and a well-known NYC restaurateur requested one of her recipes so that he can serve it in his new restaurant. We think that answers any questions about her level of gourmet creativity.  We are so sorry that our inn was not a good fit for this couple, and we once again encourage all travelers to carefully research prospective hotels by taking time to study their website (including policies and restrictions) and read a number of their reviews before booking accommodations.",none,none,none,none,none,none,815,62

Before each soak, our garden gazebo tub is sanitized and filled with fresh hot water infused with soothing Himalayan sea salts. In the case of a sunset soak, all of this is perfectly timed to assure a spectacular sunset view.

And anyone who has ever been to our website or read our reviews and my replies already knows what I’m going to say about most of this excessively critical review. However, this is definitely a time when Casa Laguna needs to correct a number of inaccurate statements. Our Deluxe Ocean View rooms are 200 square feet as indicated on the room page of our website and all are clean and well-appointed with plenty of room to move around—as seen in the photos on the Deluxe Ocean View Room page of our website. Photos on that page also show what unhappy_camper_222 calls an obstructed ocean view. The great majority of those who have stayed in this room call it quaint, charming, and comfortable, and the view spectacular. The bed is a Queen bed, not a double bed. All of our rooms have Queen or King beds. I know because I buy the linens. The great majority of our guests rave about the comfort and sleep quality of our cloudlike beds. In this case, even though our luxurious down toppers are certified hypoallergenic, unhappy_camper_222 insisted that the topper be removed—something we would usually only do for people who need to sleep on a more firm surface. Our rooms are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized every day, then inspected by the head housekeeper. An unpleasant smell in one of our bathrooms that has been fully sanitized is highly unlikely, but should a guest indicated dissatisfaction with the cleanliness of a room, we would immediately send a crew to re-clean and re-sanitize. We received no such call from unhappy_camper_222. As indicated by the majority of our reviews, road noise is not a problem for most guests, and I cannot remember every having a prior complaint about car exhaust. None of our masseuses have calloused hands—a bizarre accusation. I would invite readers to visit our website and view the photo of a couple (of average size) in our garden soak tub and determine whether the tub is, as described by unhappy_camper_222, 18” deep and not big enough for two people. That description is just as inaccurate as calling our queen bed a double bed. What unhappy_camper_222 is actually referring to is the amount of water in the tub. The tub was properly filled in time for the reserved soak, but unhappy_camper_222  arrived so late that some of the water had drained. All he needed to do was ask and we would have topped it off – something he could have also done very easily himself. And finally, we find all the talk about cost and value--to use this guest’s word--incredulous, since almost all of the cost of the stay was paid for with a gift certificate given him by a friend. It was unhappy_camper_222s  choice to leave and the reason he left was quite simply because he was an unhappy camper from the minute he arrived and there was nothing Casa Laguna management and staff could have done to make him happy. Regardless of the many misrepresentations in unhappy_camper_222s review, we take all complaints seriously and react when deemed appropriate. We will be purchasing memory foam toppers to use in place of down toppers when requested by a guest.

Because Crowsbill mentioned me specifically, I want him/her to know that I believe everyone has the right to express their opinion, and I respect that he/she has chosen this forum for that purpose. But I also believe that hoteliers have an equal right and duty to respond to reviews—particularly highly negative reviews such as this one—in an honest and straightforward manner. I will only say someone is wrong when I can back up my claim that they are wrong. For example, when someone incorrectly says that we promote ourselves as a contemporary boutique hotel, I can say that they obviously never looked at our web site or read any of our nearly 400 5-star reviews. Had Crowsbill read the About page on our website, he/she would have learned in the first paragraph that a portion of our property was, in fact, a historic motor-inn built in 1946, that was remodeled in 2000 as a bed & breakfast inn and has been continuously upgraded. The word contemporary is never used in our promotions, while the words quaint, romantic, tranquil, and historic are used again and again. When someone claims they saw outdated AC, tired furnishings, and threadbare carpeting, I can say they are wrong and show them photographs and receipts to prove it. All of our rooms have been regularly inspected and upgraded since we opened 12 years ago. Crowsbill’s negative opinions are based on his/her admitted preference for hotels like the specified Beverly Hills Four Seasons, with cookie-cutter rooms and laminated hotels-R-us furniture. Had Crowsbill looked at the page on the Casa Laguna website that shows the room he/she booked, they would have seen photos of the room that show exactly how it is furnished, and even a photo of the outside balcony and the ocean view. The square footage of the room is clearly listed in the description, and room size is described as small but quaint and comfortable in more than half of our nearly 400 5-star reviews. Finally, if Casa Laguna has a high opinion of itself, that is because our guests continually tell us how much they love our tranquil garden atmosphere, cloudlike beds, superb service, myriad amenities, and delicious food; and, the absence of the hassles and hustle-bustle associated with big name hotels and resorts.

We also thank H1CAJ for giving us the opportunity to provide important information about Laguna’s strict non-smoking ordinances. Those who come here from places where public smoking is common and openly accepted, particularly Europeans, should be aware that under California labor code it is unlawful for any individual to smoke tobacco products in an enclosed workplace, including restaurants, bars, shops, government buildings, and more. Laguna Beach ordinances further extend that restriction to include beaches and outdoor restaurant patios. California recognizes second hand smoke as a very real health issue, and therefore also permits individual businesses to restrict or prohibit smoking as they see fit. To allow smoking anywhere on our property would mean that second-hand smoke would make its way onto nearby patios and into nearby rooms, and that would be generally unhealthy and unacceptable to most of our guests. The fact that our neighbors voiced their displeasure at having someone smoking nearby shows how serious the Laguna Beach community is about this issue. I spent a great deal of time discussing the situation with this guest while she was staying with us, and I can only guess that it was my refusal to acquiesce on the subject that led to her bad opinion of me. I am, however, pleased to know that she found my staff pleasant, engaging, and helpful, as I have trained them to be. Most importantly, I am heartened to know that this couple greatly enjoyed their stay overall, and I again express my gratitude for their patronage and their honest and detailed feedback.",none,none,none,none,none,none,835,62

The morning breakfast which is included",May 2012,none,none,"We find this review very perplexing, particularly because the reviewer appears to be a returning guest, yet they do not know me or know that I have been the one and only general manager of Casa Laguna for seven years—since well before this guest started coming to Casa Laguna. There has been no change in management at Casa Laguna. And, I and my hard-working staff operate the inn with the same guest-first approach that I have always championed. Our inn is still just as friendly, comfortable, and cozy as it has always been.   I'm not sure what the reviewer means by onsite manager—typically that means a manager living on the property, which I do not, although I don’t know why that would matter. My employees are definitely not afraid of me, although sometimes I wish they were.  All but two or three staff members have been with me for 1-5 years or longer.  Very few have been let go, as implied in the review. Some have moved on to new adventures and new challenges, as sometimes happens in the hospitality business. I do not watch over my employees’ shoulders—it’s not necessary, because they are well-trained and self-motivated. I do frequently take an active role at the front desk, so that I can meet and greet arriving guests and assure that they receive the best possible service and attention. That is what a manager does.   In this case, the check-in confusion was due to the guest’s unusual last name, which, over time, had been put into the system several ways. The guest arrived before check-in time and was temporarily checked-in by my front desk supervisor. She later returned, and I needed to complete the check-in, but had difficulty finding the proper folio due to the name confusion. This took only a few minutes, and should not have been cause for major annoyance--but that is my opinion.  My efficient staff made copious notes in the guest’s folio. There was no indication that she ever asked to talk to the manager about her concerns. She did, however, lay a barrage of criticisms on the front desk clerk at checkout.  I was out on the grounds when I saw her leaving and asked why she was leaving so soon. She did not stop discuss it with me and mumbled something under her breath as she went on her way.   As to this reviewer’s specific claims: (1) There are always sufficient appetizers for our guests. Most of the time, wine and hors d’oeuvre service is handled by the front desk. On the night in question, both front desk staff members got tied-up on the phone, and appetizers temporarily ran low. As soon as one of them had completed their call, the appetizer plates were refilled. This was a rare occurrence and the amount of time elapsed was minimal. (2) We do not feel it is out of line to ask that discount cards, gift cards, gift certificates, etc., be used in accordance with the instructions clearly printed on each item. For important bookkeeping reasons, the gift cards we send our valued guests during the holidays clearly state that the bearer must make related bookings directly through our front desk. We have too little control over outside booking resources to use them for anything other than standard non-discounted reservations.  (3) None of my staff members remembers this guest reporting having an emergency at home, and there is no mention of it in the copious notes my staff left in her folio—only that the guest “had to go.” Regardless, had either myself or my assistant manager been made aware of such a situation, we would have provided a voucher for a future stay, as is our standard policy. If the guest would like to contact me personally, I would still provide this courtesy, although her highly critical review indicates she will not return.  I am always truly disheartened on those rare occasions when I learn that any guest was not happy with the service provided—and particularly when I learn about it from a review rather than through a face-to-face discussion with the guest while they are on the property.  Casa Laguna has not changed, it has only improved. However, we understand that the criteria of some of our guests will change, and there may come a time when a different hotel may be more to their liking.  As previously stated, I am at a loss to understand why this guest did not recognize me as the long-time manager, why she would think that our inn had new management, or why she did not bring her concerns to me at the time so that we could immediately address and resolve her issues. I want her to know that I appreciate her past patronage, and I wish her well.",none,none,none,none,none,none,875,62

Addressing this guest’s specified cons: Only those guests who are especially sensitive to ambient noise are bothered by the sound of traffic on Pacific Coast Highway. Visitors to Laguna Beach should be prepared for the fact that a great portion of the town is built on smaller-scale San Francisco type hills that are easily and comfortably ascended in autos by always using first (or Low) gear. Casa Laguna has more dedicated parking than the typical bed & breakfast, and while guests do have to exercise care by swinging wide to circumvent support poles between spaces, those spaces are the same size at those in most hotel parking lots—approximately 8 feet in width. And lastly, we apologize to jimb78 for not thoroughly explaining that Casa Laguna has never had a Jacuzzi because shared or public tubs are notoriously unsanitary and often inspire boisterous and noisy behavior. What people sometimes mistake for a Jacuzzi is our by-reservation-only ocean-view Soak Tub that is drained, sterilized, and refilled with clean, fresh water infused with Himalayan sea salts before each use. Our Sea-salt Soak is a spa-service available to couples or individuals, and we believe the time and effort put into this service by our employees before and after each use is well worth the minimal charge.

Multiple order limitations are necessary in order to assure that we don’t run short or have excessive waste.

And we’re always disheartened when we learn that our inn was not a good match for a guest, as was clearly the case with WendyPrince. Just because Casa Laguna’s guest approval rating is consistently high doesn’t mean we are right for everyone. We urge all travelers, regardless of where they plan to stay, to carefully research their prospective accommodations before making a booking. Our website and reviews make it clear that our property was constructed on a steep hillside in the 1920s and ‘40s and has many inclined brick pathways and steps that are an important part of our history and our charm. We are clearly a historic inn, not a big-box hotel or resort. The subject of our proximity to Pacific Coast Highway  has been discussed ad nauseum, indicating a clear consensus among our guests that those who are not extremely sensitive to ambient noise will not be disturbed by this minor issue. Our website has a detailed description and photographs of each of our rooms—even listing the square footage. We also encourage prospective guests with specific needs or concerns to call our front desk before booking.  While the quality of our staff and service is praised in almost every review, prospective travelers should be aware that we do not have a bellman, valet parking, or room service, as this guest expected when she arrived. We have, and always will, do everything reasonable and achievable to assure our guests’ comfort and satisfaction. In regard to other specific issues raised by WendyPrince; Our awarding-winning breakfast is our most popular amenity. Almost no one visiting Casa Laguna eats in their room and, like most bed & breakfast inns, we do not offer room service. Breakfast is always served to our registered guests at no charge on two spacious patios and in the Mission House. We offer a special Breakfast-Inn-Bed package for $25, but this guest never ordered that special. The room in question is a Deluxe Room with View Patio. It has an ocean view from the patio only--and that patio contains a lovely wrought iron high-top table and chairs for two, where couples frequently enjoy our Breakfast-Inn-Bed package. At this guest’s request, we brought in two lower folding chairs for their convenience. There is no room for a second, smaller table on the patio even if we had a spare table of that type, which we do not. Our patio rooms are somewhat smaller than a typical brand-name hotel room, but our guests as a whole find them comfortable and well-appointed.  The bathroom is modern and well-outfitted, including a jetted double spa tub for two. With respect to this guest’s opinion, the room and bathroom are charming and clean and are not in need of refurbishment. Our housekeepers use only environmentally friendly cleaning products. Both our Maintenance Manager and Head of Housekeeping investigated the odor reported by this guest and noticed nothing significant.  I am so sorry that WendyPrince and her companion did not find Casa Laguna to their liking. My staff is particularly careful to document rare problems or complaints, and I found extensive notations in this guest’s folio. I believe that we made every reasonable effort to accommodate her special needs. However, as previously stated, it is clear that she was expecting something much more in line with facilities and services provided by a bustling resort or branded hotel.",none,none,none,none,none,none,884,62

Finally, we are so very sorry that slow breakfast service was an issue for Mrs.VEB. This rare problem can sometimes occur when all of our guests decide to come down for breakfast at the same time. But we want you to know that, at Casa Laguna, we listen and react. As a result of MrsVEB’s feedback, we plan to initiate a simple reservation system for busy periods that will limit the number of guests being served during each ½ hour cycle and thereby greatly improve both service speed and cooking times.

We have always been a pet-friendly inn and we have hundreds of new and returning guests who bring their dogs and abide by the rules we have in place to protect the health, safety, and comfort of all our guests—including those with four-legs. Such rules are the standard of the industry and are clearly listed on our website and in our pet agreement, which every guest-with-pet must sign, as did Louis S when he arrived for this stay in July of last year. We do not allow pets to be left alone in rooms because many pets will act-up while their people are away, often barking and sometimes causing damage. We do not allow pets to roam freely off their leashes--this is a danger to the dog and possibly to other guests. And, most germane to the issue of this guest, for reasons we believe are obvious and logical, we do not allow pets in the pool. This guest was asked to keep his dog on a leash and not to allow it in the pool. Apparently he did not feel that such rules were in line with being pet friendly and was later seen with his dog in the pool a second time, at which time he was asked to leave the pool area. His wife then approached the front desk in an agitated manner and expressed that they wanted to leave. We went to great effort to find them new accommodations elsewhere, but they changed their mind and said they would stay the night. They left the next day, well after our standard check-out time. These guests were not forced to relocate. It was their decision to leave because they did not like our pet policies and stated that they saw our administration of those policies and other rules as rudeness.

In the latter case, we always encourage the concerned guests to let us know right away, so that we can contact those noisy neighbors and make them aware that they are disturbing others. We have a guest service representative on-property 24 hours a day, and rare annoyances can almost always be solved quickly, allowing our guests to enjoy a trouble-free stay.

With respect, Nicetoeatout reserved a Deluxe Ocean View Room, not a suite--which would have been much larger--and no rooms are referred to as Executive Suites. Our reviews and our website talk about how we sit on a steeply terraced hillside with stairs. That due to being a historic property some of the rooms are small—but all are well-appointed. And that our Ocean View and Deluxe Ocean View rooms have a walkway with comfy Catalina view courting benches outside each room. What Nicetoeatout calls a musty smell was, in fact, the very mild dissipating odor of fresh paint in our Mission House reception area, not in their room.

We also thank them for the opportunity to clarify that beautiful Victoria Beach is just a 10 minute walk from Casa Laguna, and the trip back is only slightly longer due to being uphill from the oceanfront. Also, when people use the word hot tub or Jacuzzi we like to let everyone know that we have neither of those on the property, because they are notoriously difficult to keep sanitized and often draw boisterous activity not fitting with Casa Laguna’s tranquil, romantic ambiance. Our deluxe rooms and suites have jetted double spa tubs built for two, which are far more sanitary and certainly more private and romantic than a public outdoor Jacuzzi. The exclusive, one-of-a-kind ocean-view outdoor garden gazebo soak tub mentioned by lespes is available by appointment as a Spa Service. Before each soak, it is drained, sanitized, and filled with fresh water infused with imported therapeutic salts. Thus, we believe the hygienic assurance and restorative benefits are well worth the nominal fee. In addition to the free summer shuttle mentioned by lespes, Laguna Beach has a marvelous public transportation system that is clean and inexpensive and runs year round. We thank lespes for mentioning our many free amenities that other hotels and resorts often charge for, or tack-on in resort fees, such as property-wide WiFi, DVDs to show on the flat panel TVs, heated pool, a gourmet breakfast, evening wine and hors d'oeuvres, and free parking.

We appreciate the opportunity to explain that, before each soak, our ocean-view garden gazebo soak tub is drained, sanitized, and filled with fresh water that has been infused with imported therapeutic salts. This is a spa service that we believe is well worth a nominal fee for our efforts. We do not have a public Jacuzzi because they are notoriously difficult to keep sanitized and often draw boisterous activity not fitting with Casa Laguna’s tranquil ambiance.  As mentioned by Chris P, many of our rooms have jetted double spa tubs built for two, which are far more sanitary and certainly more private and romantic than a public outdoor Jacuzzi. We again reiterate—perhaps too often—that parking in Laguna Beach, like all beach cities, is premium. Thus, unlike most bed & breakfast inns, we are privileged to have free off-street covered parking for the majority of our guests, and nearby overflow street parking in this residential area is free as well. As Chris P suggests, parking does require some care on the part of the driver, but we love to show off a photograph we have of a Hummer parked in one our standard covered slots, with a little room to spare all around. We agree with Chris P that our highly popular Courtyard rooms are cozy-comfy--and they also offer our best value. However, our ocean view rooms offer expansive Pacific Ocean and romantic Catalina sunset views both from the bed and from a cushy courting bench outside each door. It’s clear that this guest and Casa Laguna were a perfect match, and we love it when that happens. We once again thank Chris P for taking the time to let others know how much they enjoyed their stay, and especially for providing honest, informed opinions and recommendations that will help prospective guests choose rooms and amenities that also fit their personal preferences.",none,none,none,none,none,none,930,62

One of our front desk clerks admittedly dropped the ball on this one. He has been admonished, and both he and the remainder of the staff have received retraining regarding this issue. I want to express my sincere apologies to both the guest and their friend.  We greatly appreciate tikijo’s kind words about how much they enjoyed the majority of their stay, and I assure them that their next visit will not be just acceptable, but exceptional.  In regard to the spa appointment, the error occurred because our customary schedule is to provide the soak after the massage, but this guest requested it the other way around. We sent a confirming email/letter in a standard form that gives only the massage time, since the soak is usually an adjunct to the massage. As a result of this misunderstanding, we have adjusted our pre-arrival email/letter to clearly indicate both the soak time and massage time, so that there will be no future confusion about spa scheduling. Of course, this process depends on having an accurate mailing address and/or unblocked email.  In regard to the noisy neighbors, it is the policy of Casa Laguna not to allow our guests to disturb other guests. Any of our guests need only call the front desk, and we will take care of the problem immediately. If a second call becomes necessary, the bothersome guest will be asked to vacate their room and leave the property. As always, we encourage all travelers, wherever they are staying, to immediately contact hotel management when they experience a problem or have a complaint, so that the situation can be quickly rectified, allowing the guest to enjoy their stay to the fullest.

After reading this review, we joked that we should perhaps start charging a resort fee, like many of our competitors. Only a joke of course, based on FASTRMF’s repeated insistence that we are a resort. While we offer many resort-style amenities, we much prefer to be called a bed & breakfast inn. We differ from the typical resort in that we have only 22 rooms with 10 different room types and sizes, furnished in a style reminiscent of the historical period in which the inn was built. Unlike most resorts, we do not cater to families or groups. We provide a cloistered romantic getaway for couples; and a tranquil escape for individuals seeking personalized service and attention not found at big-box hotels. We will pass along FASTRMF’s compliments to our hard working staff, and we cannot thank this couple enough for pointing out the many features and amenities that make Casa Laguna well worth our competitive prices. We do get occasional comments about the lack of a public Jacuzzi or hot tub on property. There is, first, a problem with lack of space – also the reason we have no gym facilities. Additionally, shared Jacuzzis are notorious for their sanitation problems and can often become a place for boisterous activity and noise at night, which is not in keeping with our tranquil setting. Our therapeutic spa tub is drained, cleaned, sanitized, and freshly refilled before each and every use. Hours of use are limited to avoid the necessity of bothersome safety lighting, and so that nearby guests and neighbors are not disturbed by the tub’s occupants during peaceful evenings in this mostly residential community. As FASTRMF suggests, those interested in a soak-only should try to book early in the day, with the understanding that spa package reservations are given first priority. Advance reservations for a therapeutic soak in our ocean view garden tub can only be made as part of a spa package, as described on our website. Of course, many of our rooms have private oversized jetted spa tubs built for two, as mentioned by FASTRMF.

It is clear from their comments that we were not the proper fit for this couple, and that they would have been happier in a resort-type hotel rather than a historic bed and breakfast inn located in a residential area away from the hubbub of downtown Laguna Beach. We are so glad that they enjoyed our acclaimed breakfast and accompanying service. As indicated by the majority of our prior reviews, AJ5555 is very much in the minority regarding much of their assessment of our inn. With respect for their differing opinion….We are 1.5 miles from downtown Laguna Beach, and we know from experience that this is too far for most of our guests to walk, especially when the first ¼ mile or so has no safe sidewalk on our side of the street. For those guests who do not wish to drive, we recommend the clean and reliable local shuttle system, for which we will pay the fare.  We have two superb restaurants within walking distance of our inn, one of which is highly Zagat rated, and each with very different types of food and pricing. Our Courtyard rooms have a bed, round side table, and a small desk with side chair – therefore sufficiently appointed, but far from overstuffed. These are our smaller, “artist” rooms, fitting with the historic nature of our property, and are a favorite of many returning guests. We are understanding, on those rare occasions when this is our last available room type and a walk-in guest does not find it sufficient for their needs – and we will always do our best to help them find other accommodations in the area that better meet their criteria. Casa Laguna is a green inn with controlled-flow plumbing fixtures. Sufficiency of water flow is checked during regular inspections, and we are always quick to respond to any complaint of reduced-flow problems. Finally, as our prior reviews reflect (particularly the one just previous to this) we are constantly complimented for our dedicated guest-first service.  However, we are a bed & breakfast inn, not a wide-lobby resort hotel; therefore, there are times when a lone desk clerk may be required to handle several check-ins while taking a phone call or two.  On those rare occasions when things get a bit hectic, we hope arriving guests will not mistake hurriedness for perfunctoriness.

This couple liked our roomy Capistrano Suite, which no doubt had something to do with the cozy, private double-jetted tub for two that has its own separate enclosed nook.

Through our website and advertising, we make every effort to assure that prospective guests are aware that we are a romantic bed & breakfast inn comprised of historic buildings sitting on Pacific Coast Highway, and not a big-box hotel with a restaurant, valet parking, huge staff, and other luxury conveniences for jet-setters. Despite these efforts, there are times when it is immediately clear, as in this case, that Casa Laguna is not the proper fit for a particular guest.  This became especially clear when we read 1JetSetGal1’s long list of prior reviews, and noted in this review that her prior favorite place to stay in Laguna Beach was a resort hotel known for its ultra-modern décor and party atmosphere.  We must now respond to 1JetSetGal1’s complaints and comments, but we first want to advise prospective visitors that the situations and criticisms described are rare, and 1JetSetGal1’s opinions do not reflect the opinion of the majority of our guests, as you can see from our many glowing reviews.  Considering that our inn is always listed as one of the top two Laguna Beach accommodations, our rates are competitive and reasonable.  The air conditioning in the Capistrano Suite has always been suitable for our guests staying in that room, and if we had received any sort of complaint about it at the time 1JetSetGal1 was visiting, we would have checked to see if it needed maintenance-or if the guest was perhaps having problems adjusting the unit. After reading this review, our maintenance manager checked the unit and found that it was working properly and was more than sufficient to keep the bedroom at a comfortable temperature.  The Capistrano Suite does sit above our scullery. During the production of breakfast, staff will enter the scullery to get food from the refrigerators,  prepare fruit plates, etc. No dishwashing takes place until after 9am. My staff has been instructed to keep noise to a minimum at all times. We apologize if that was not the case when 1JetSetGal1 was staying with us. However, one quick call to the front desk would have made us aware of the problem and it would have been immediately rectified. I have personally met with all of my kitchen staff to reiterate the need for maximum care and consideration while working in the scullery.  It is true that, during the time of 1JetSetGal1’s stay, we were in the process of installing an upgraded Wi-Fi system, which meant that certain areas of coverage were temporarily down. The Wi-Fi had not, as 1JetSetGal1 suggested, been down for a while. We purchased enough CAT5 cables to assure that rooms temporarily without Wi-Fi could avail themselves of a wired connection. Being a bed & breakfast inn that caters to romantic getaways and relaxing retreats--and, which gets few business travelers--we were unprepared for an unusual onslaught of guests needing CAT5 cables because their older laptops would not connect with the Wi-Fi, and we ran short. As 1JetSetGal1 points out, we did have Wi-Fi available at convenient locations on the property, and Internet access was available in our business center. Trevor (we have no Adam) called me and advised me of the situation and I told him to pull the CAT5 cable from my office computer and give it to this guest so they could connect to the Internet—thus leaving me without an Internet connection in my office for the rest of the day. We apologize to anyone who was inconvenienced during this period, and we want prospective guests to know that the upgraded Wi-Fi system is now fully functional and available throughout the property.  We have a large private parking lot that has met our clientele’s needs for more than a decade. We have more parking than most bed & breakfast inns that are located, as we are, in a residential area. Only those arriving very late on the busiest of weekends will need to park a short distance away. Vehicles have no trouble driving up the hill to our parking lot. We suggest you use first gear. Parking is at a premium throughout this busy beach city and we always recommend that once you have parked your car at the inn, you avail yourself of the clean and comfortable public transportation that is available right outside our door and is far less expensive than a Taxi. Trolley service is free during festival season, and Casa Laguna will pay your shuttle fair during off season.  And finally….Our guests rave about our breakfasts and praise our breakfast servers. On the day in question, the scheduled server did not show for work and could not be reached, leaving our chef to scramble to find someone to cover. Unable to reach any of the regular servers, he called in someone we had just hired who had not yet been trained. Normally, our guests arrive for breakfast at the rate of three or four tables every 30 minutes. Adding to a perfect storm of unforeseen circumstances, on this particular morning almost everyone decided to show up at about the same time—overwhelming the chef, the untrained server, and all of our kitchen staff. It was a rare and unique situation that was beyond our control and could not be foreseen. I am proud of our chef and his staff for keeping it together and getting out all the breakfasts, even though it perhaps took a little longer and the plates weren’t quite as pretty as usual. I personally helped serve, made apologies, and received understanding and sympathy from almost all of my guests, including others at 1JetSetGal1’s table.

We were told that we would have to purchase two rooms for the three of us. I was actually told that one of us would have to stay in a room with my daughter and the other one would stay in a room alone. The other option was to all stay in one room and let the second room be empty during the stay even though we would be paying full price for it. Seriously?

Please note that, while her review is stated to be solely about service, there is no mention of poor service in the review. She is clearly using this forum to broadcast her displeasure about one particular policy. In order to maintain a relaxing, romantic ambiance, and assure the safety, comfort, and contentment of all of our guests, we find it necessary to limit room occupancy to one or two persons only. We make it clear in all of our advertising and on all web sites over which we have control or input, that Casa Laguna has no facilities or amenities suitable for children, infants, gatherings, or events. As indicated in many of our glowing reviews, our guests appreciate the resulting tranquil and relaxing ambiance. As was clearly and politely explained to this person, we are a small romantic inn that caters to couples and individuals looking for a peaceful retreat. We do not say that anyone of any age is not welcome. We do not say that children are not welcome, as she suggests we should do, because that is not our policy. Our policy—delineated on our website and elsewhere—clearly states that all of our rooms are designed to accommodate one or two adult guests only, and that our inn is not appropriate for children under age 16—again, specifically using the word “appropriate.” We believe the meaning of this word is quite clear. It appears that this individual attempted to book a room online and tried to enter three guests. The system did not permit the booking to be made because there is a limitation of two guests per room. Despite the fact that our policies are clearly stated on our web site, she then went ahead with the reservation for two people and posted an attachment to her reservation saying that she would be bringing her infant child to stay in the room with her and her husband. She was immediately contacted by our staff and our policy was politely explained to her. She then became angry—stating, however, to our employee that she was not angry with her (our employee's) service, only with our policies.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,How can we NOT make your stay more enjoyable.,"Just wanted to give you a note regarding our stay at Casa Laguna Beach.  Three of us visited your B&B from the 9th of March through the 13th.   We booked at your B&B as our regular accommodations in Newport had been sold out.  We were looking for a quiet room and a spa.  Based upon that information we found the Laguna Getaway.  The attached was illustrated in your specials and we thought we could really use this sort of spoiling as we were at a convention all day long.  However, it soon became the joke of our stay regarding your B&B “How can we NOT make your stay more enjoyable.”  I have truly not been told NO more times than any other stay at any other hotel than yours.  I was told that only one of our rooms would qualify for the $90.00 credit as I booked all the rooms under my",March 2011,none,none,"I first want to apologize for the misunderstanding that led to this review. However, I also want to point out that this guest gave us high ratings in four of the six categories, but, unfortunately, gave us a rating of two overall due entirely to the aforementioned misunderstanding. We pride ourselves on the dedicated guest-first service that earns us so many raves from our clientele. Rarely, as in this case, a misunderstanding occurs due to an employee not being perfectly clear on the details of a particular policy. As general manager, I always hope that, when such a misunderstanding occurs, the employee or guest will contact me, so that I can resolve the problem quickly and, hopefully, to the satisfaction of the guest. In this case, I first heard about the problem through the guest’s negative review.  The spa credit mentioned by BIZTRAV80640 does in fact apply to all rooms/guests that are booked by the qualifying individual who requests the special at time of reservation and provides payment. Our front desk clerk mistakenly assumed that the credit could only be applied to the room of the guest who made the booking. Now that I am aware of the situation, I will contact the guest directly and correct this error, with apologies. The clerk in question has already undergone retraining regarding our policies and how to handle guest inquiries concerning these policies.  As to the length of our hot stone massage—as is the standard of the industry, the manner in which spa services are provided are based on the times and methods recommended by our professional therapists. It is the experienced opinion of all of our therapists that a quality hot stone massage cannot be completed in less than 90 minutes. I have checked with other hotel spas in the area, and almost all of them have set 90 minutes as the standard for hot stone massage. Therefore, in the interest of providing the best possible guest experience, we do not offer a 60 minute hot stone service, and our therapists have asked that we do not shorten the agreed time-standard for this service.  And finally, in this age of electronic access, we do not feel the need to keep Yellow Pages at the front desk. This guest came to the desk and asked specifically for a copy of the Yellow Pages. Since this guest did not ask about a particular place or destination, our desk clerk assumed the guest wanted to sit down with a copy of the Yellow Pages and spend some time researching a particular product or service. He therefore referred the guest to the Yellow Pages in their room. In retrospect, it is quite clear that our employee should have, then and there, asked the guest if he could help them find what they were looking for by checking online.  Again, the employee in question, who almost always receives high marks for his customer service, has undergone retraining.  Both he and I offer our sincerest apologies for our failure on this occasion to offer the absolute best customer service, as is our standard and our distinction, and as is reflected in our many excellent reviews.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1042,62

Unfortunately, hotels and inns around the world could not operate without policies, and because we have to administer those policies equally with every guest or prospective guest, disappointments can occur.  We’ve checked, and our five-day cancellation policy is among the most liberal among bed & breakfast inns nationwide. When you only have 22 rooms, the last-minute loss of two night’s income can quickly add up. We understand that emergencies do happen, and when possible, we will try to make adjustments as we did for dawnlpm. However, we continue to strongly suggest that, as soon as your travel plans are set, you immediately purchase travel insurance. The cost is minimal, and if something happens prompting a last minute cancellation, or if the weather turns bad, or your trip is interrupted, neither Casa Laguna nor our guest will suffer a financial setback.  We love being able to allow pets to bring their people to Casa Laguna--we have hundreds of regular four-legged guests who come back again and again. But, while everybody thinks their dog is perfect, we all know that there are many pets who have a problem with chewing and/or barking, and they can only keep their legs crossed for so long. Therefore, to avoid the possibility of disturbing nearby guests, or property being damaged, we must have a strict policy about not leaving dogs alone in the room. And again, like all our policies, this rule must be equally enforced across the board. It’s only fair. And we thank dawnlpm for pointing out that all our policies are clearly stated on our web site and associated reservation sites, as well as in our confirmation email and check-in paperwork.  We’re so sorry that dawnlpm’s stay was not everything she had hoped for, but we’re so happy she loved our inn and plans to come back for a romantic getaway.

However, this time we wanted to have a quiet experience similar to that of our Carmel trips where we stay at really cute bed and breakfast inns and enjoy the quiet and spas of these smaller places.  Because of the reviews on this website and the massive SEO campaign that Casa Laguna has used in its marketing, we spent our hard earned money staying here in the larger Balboa Suite this Labor Day weekend. We came home early to rest because our stay was terrible.  The website is misleading about Casa Laguna's proximity to the beach if you are not familiar with Orange County.              The resort is beautiful, and the staff is friendly, but the location (look at the map carefully) is terrible!",September 2010,none,none,"This reviewer’s contention that there is no sleeping here is completely unfounded and is entirely a singular, personal opinion. Nearly all of our guests--literally thousands of guests each year--get a good night’s sleep at Casa Laguna; and dozens did so on the three nights this guest was with us. I personally discussed the matter with this guest, and I explained that, not only were we sold out, but the entire town was sold out due to the Labor Day weekend. On those rare occasions when a guest is unhappy with their accommodations, we are always prepared to move them within the property if possible--or even find them accommodations elsewhere if they prefer. It just simply was not possible over this holiday weekend.   Yes, we do sit on Pacific Coast Highway, which does not resemble a freeway in any manner other than the fact that it is occupied by vehicles making their way up and down our beautiful coast. Laguna Beach is nothing like Carmel, and Casa Laguna is nothing like the Hyatt--which is the type of accommodation this guest admittedly prefers when visiting Orange County. Our marketing--SEO or otherwise--makes no attempt to mislead our prospective guests in any way, as furlagirl alleges. With a little basic advance research, she would have easily seen that the whole of Laguna is a long, narrow stretch of coastal property that owes its existence to the easy access provided by historic Pacific Coast Highway. Thousands of multi-million dollar homes and businesses, including dozens of high-end resorts and fabulous gourmet restaurants are within earshot of the PCH drone. Except for a sensitive few, most visitors do not find it outrageous, or so devastatingly annoying that it occupies their thoughts for more than a few moments.   We do not provide sound machines because the majority of our guests would not use them and they are not particularly effective anyway. The air conditioner in our spa is just that, an air conditioner--but if it worked well for furlagirl as a sound dampener, the air conditioner in her room would have worked equally well.   Casa Laguna is within walking distance--10 to 15 minutes on average--of one of the most interesting and  beautiful beaches in Laguna; and, our marketing is absolutely honest in that regard. We make it clear that our historic, former artist's compound occupies a terraced hillside with winding stairs and walkways that would certainly be unsuitable for those with physical limitations.  We get rave reviews about our friendly, considerate, and attentive staff; and, no one who works for me would ever say that noise is a huge problem, because it is not. And, while we are not perfect, we certainly do not adjust our prices for any perceived negative aspects of our property. Again, our feedback and overwhelmingly positive reviews tell us that, for the great majority of our guests, we’re doing things right.   We appreciate that furlagirl found our property beautiful and our staff friendly. We’re glad she and her husband had the opportunity to enjoy lovely spa treatments, our ocean-view soak tub, and our acclaimed award-winning breakfasts. We are truly sorry that, due to her sensitivity to road noise, she felt that her money was wasted on a stay at our beautiful property and all the wonderful amenities she admittedly enjoyed. Had we known in advance of her sensitivity, we most certainly would have recommended that she not stay with us. And, had there been any way to provide appeasing alternative accommodations, we would have willingly and graciously done so.   Finally, furlagirl suggests that you sleep elsewhere and just eat here.

We",August 2010,none,none,"We thank Hbaxter for taking the time to provide us with this valuable feedback. Responding to his criticisms in order: We have lush grounds with many trees, therefore leaves and debris will end up in the pool. We skim it regularly throughout the day, and all our guests need do is bring it to our attention and we will immediately send someone to take care of the problem. We make it clear on our web site, and in promotions and photographs, that we do not sit on the beach and we are located on the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway. Beautiful Victoria Beach is within easy walking distance for most guests, who typically require 10-15 minutes to walk there and maybe a bit longer to walk back. I sincerely apologize for not having hot coffee immediately available at 9:00 P.M. at night. As Hbaxter indicated, a staff-member is always available to make fresh coffee for those who wish a late-night cup—and since so few guests drink coffee that late, I believe those who do would better appreciate having it fresh-made. As for breakfast, unlike most B&Bs, we provide not just one breakfast for everyone, but a list of made-to-order gourmet breakfasts that guests can choose from a menu. On the day in question, we had a problem with our oven—something entirely beyond our control—which meant that our chefs were unable to produce a few of the items. As Hbaxter stated, five different gourmet breakfasts—many of them among our most popular dishes—were still available that morning.  We sometimes forget that there are people who are set in their breakfast ways and prefer a hearty quantity of good-old bacon and eggs-which we’re more than happy to provide. As a result of Hbaxter’s comments, I have instructed my kitchen staff to make sure that those who forgo our gourmet selections for a classic breakfast always get a generous portion of everything on the plate. As Hbaxter states, we are typically number 1 on TripAdvisor. But as we’ve often said, that simply means the great majority of our guests appreciate our beauty, comfort, superb service, and acclaimed gourmet food.

It should be clear to anyone that makes a reservation at Casa Laguna that we are a small, romantic bed & breakfast. That is how we promote our inn, and that is reflected in our many glowing reviews. It has been and will remain our policy to restrict access to our grounds by individuals or groups of people who may disrupt or disturb other guests. There is also a matter of possible security problems when there are individuals on the property who are not registered with our front desk. We do occasionally allow someone to have a friend or couple visit them before or after dinner. We do not allow parties or gatherings of any type. My front staff is well-trained and would never tell a prospective guest that it is ok for them to have a party or gathering of friends. If asked whether or not a friend could visit, they most certainly would have said yes—and they would have then explained the guidelines.  In no case would we allow someone to bring a non-registered pet onto the property. In this particular case, the visiting pet was discovered when it began barking at guests from the room’s patio.  Again, this is matter of safety and possible disturbance of guests. Children are not allowed for the same reason. Many of our guests are here for a romantic getaway, and the presence of rambunctious children is not conducive to romance. In response to rileykevin’s accusations, I never personally spoke to the child or the parents of the child. Also, he and two of his guests did in fact use the pool, with the visiting dog leashed nearby. This room was registered to one single guest.  At last count, on the day in question, there were eight visitors, a dog, and a child, in this guest’s room.  I found this to be unacceptable and disruptive, and I may indeed have sounded a bit gruff when I asked this guest to control the barking dog and not to bring in anymore friends.  I would disagree with rileykevin’s contention that I was at any time discourteous to his guests.  It is unfortunate that we were not aware in advance that rileykevin was planning a party with friends at our inn. We most certainly would have graciously offered to help him locate a more appropriate venue for his event. Finally, I would agree with  rileykevin’s suggestion that you don’t go there, if you plan to have a party or event. That’s not what Casa Laguna is about.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1082,62

6 helpful votes,20 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Too small,We had the Deluxe ocean room which was on the small side and we were able to see the ocean and a beautiful sunset. Our room had no space for me to sit down and get myself ready or to eat a little something if it was brought back to the room. A main issue was the light outside our room was too bright and it kept us awake. The parking was no fun because once you got your spot you didn't want to get back into your car to  lose it. Each room should have assigned spots so you know it's always there no matter what time the guest comes back. I was not aware until a guest told us that a shuttle came to the B&B to take them to the beach. There is no real beach access from the B&B :( I am disappointed that my husband and I didn't do anything I had planned like the Victoria Beach caves.,August 2010,none,none,"We are so sorry to learn that Mom2Rach’s experience was not as she expected. At Casa Laguna, we understand that we cannot be everything to everybody. Therefore, we take great care to insure that any promotional materials over which we have direct control give a clear picture of who we are, where we are located, and what we provide. Both the photographs and the description on our web site make it very clear that we are not a beach-front property. We are, however, less than a 15-minute walk from beautiful Victoria Beach, and we provide towels, beach chairs, and umbrellas to take along.  We are at a loss to understand why Mom2Rach and her husband did not visit Victoria Beach as they planned.  Regarding the shuttle, we always love it when it’s summer-shuttle-time in Laguna Beach, so we make sure that every arriving guest is informed, as part of their arrival orientation, that there is a shuttle stop just outside our door. We have a lot to talk about when we take you on the initial tour of our property, so it’s not unusual for people to blank-out on something we told them. However, the shuttle is always part of the conversation among guests at breakfast and at evening wine and cheese. We are a historic property, built in the 1920s. Therefore, some of our rooms are small, but well appointed; and, there are wonderful gardens and terraces with tables that are far more appropriate for snacking. That is also made clear on our web site. Like most hotels and inns, many of our rooms sit side by side and have connecting walkways, so you are occasionally going to hear your neighbors come and go. On any rare occasion when noise becomes unusual or excessive, a complaint to the front desk will prompt an immediate response. We thank KariSlc for bringing to our attention that outdoor lighting is making its way into that room. We sincerely apologize, and we are taking steps to alleviate the problem. And finally, as we’ve said before, visitors need to be prepared for the fact that parking is at a premium throughout Laguna Beach, as it is in most beach towns. We are thrilled to offer our guests a significant number of off street parking spaces on a first-come-first-served basis, and we are very lucky in that street-parking is almost always available nearby, for late-comers. Due to the variety of vehicles driven by our guests and the varied sizes of the parking spots, assigned spaces are not a viable alternative. Again, we’re sorry that we did not meet Mom2Rach’s criteria, and we know that our friends at the Surf & Sand will provide a superb beach-front experience for her when next she visits our city.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1085,62

Some innovative and some just sort of shabby. The bathroom is fantastic: it has a large tub with jets and it easily fits two people. There is a medium shower with two large showerheads. The showerheads are installed into the ceiling and spray directly down. However, to stand beneath the left one is difficult because of the unusual shape of the shower itself.

In recent memory, prior to these two posts, we have never had these kind of complaints about the Cottage—which, I reiterate, is one of our most popular and sought-after rooms. No previous Cottage guest has ever used the word shabby in describing this building. Hundreds of guests have enjoyed the steam shower without concern. Many have relaxed with a good book in front of the fireplace. Our rooms are carefully inspected each day—and after reading these two reviews, I personally inspected the sofa and found only one tiny stain. The furniture in the cottage is arranged according to the experience of the owner and management, and we do not expect that our guests will completely rearrange a room or, as in this case, leave it rearranged when they check out. Any guest can call the front desk at any time, night or day, and ask for furniture to be moved, replaced, or removed, and we will be glad to accommodate reasonable wishes. After reading these back-to-back reviews, myself and my staff entered the cottage and listened for road noise. Only if we stood perfectly silent could we hear the distant sound of Pacific Coast Highway. We never say that Casa Laguna does not experience some road noise—like many Laguna Beach accommodations, we sit conveniently on Pacific Coast Highway. For most guests, it soon simply becomes white noise.

The pros she listed are among the many fabulous attributes that keep out guests coming back again and again. We're sorry this guest felt there were some cons as well. Traffic noise, and background noise in general, is a fact of life in Laguna Beach. All hotels and inns here and in nearby beach towns have the same problem to varying degrees. There are no perfectly quiet getaways in a bustling beach town such as this. However, we're at a loss to understand how the noise bothered this guest while staying in the Cottage, which is constructed entirely of brick and is a full block back from Pacific Coast Highway, with buildings and plants filling the space in between. We will take this opportunity to say again, honestly, that this is not a complaint we get from guests staying in the Cottage. Keep in mind that we are surrounded by houses and condos, and the noise level at Casa Laguna is no greater than that experienced by the hundreds of residents who reside around us in luxury homes. Unfortunately, one of those homes is currently being renovated. Construction crews are forbidden by law from making noise before 8AM or after 5PM, and we monitor the situation very closely.  Most of our guests are at breakfast by 8:00 and are then soon off to enjoy Laguna's many fun diversions, returning after the construction noise has settled. And, of course, this is a temporary situation. As to the music, most of our guests love the ambient music on the property--we're sorry this guest did not.

We were so excited to have this romantic weekend and couldn't wait to see the Inn and Spa, which we were told had to be reserved upon arrival.  Check in was supposed to be 4:00 and we arrived early at about 3:00 or so.  The desk clerk checked us in and showed us the layout (minus the spa) and our room.

Based on our various feedback sources, we know that our customer satisfaction rating is very high. However, we are also realistic about the likelihood that there will occasionally be guests for whom we are simply not a good fit. We try to keep this from happening through honest, detailed, disclosure at the time reservations are made.  Occasionally, someone checks in and expresses disappointment with their choice. We are never hesitant to make adjustments to assure the complete satisfaction of our guests, whenever possible. But, there are times when the only available resolution is to offer to find them accommodations elsewhere, as in this case. They were able to enjoy the larger, resort hotel atmosphere they preferred, and we were able to reset their room for a guest who appreciates our relatively small historic property sitting on a beautifully garden-terraced hillside, with a gourmet breakfast and evening wine and cheese service. These guests understand that, while some of our rooms are small, there is plenty of space to move about the room and enjoy the features and conveniences. As to the patio in question, it is private to that room. It is not shared with another room. That is the standard industry definition of a private patio. The patio is not secluded from the outside world, and it does not have a 360 degree ocean view. It does, however, have a beautiful view of the ocean, including our gorgeous Catalina sunsets. Most of our guests appreciate the fact that we have been able to maintain the personality of this charming property while providing all of the modern amenities that today’s discriminating travelers are looking for.  For those guests who need more space, we recommend our larger suites, which are a great value.  However, our larger rooms and suites often book well in advance, and I am sorry that we were unable to offer pasadenababy more choice because she made her reservations just a few days before arrival.  We were fully committed that weekend, as we usually are, and it was just not possible to offer them another room. And finally, it appears that pasadenababy asked about spa reservations after their arrival. The many guests staying with us that weekend who had made their reservations well in advance had, of course, been given first choice for available spa times. At the time of reservation, we inform guests of policies regarding our spa services, and then, a week prior to arrival, we send a confirmation letter offering assistance with dinner and spa reservations.  Since pasadenababy’s reservation was made last minute, we were unable to provide these pre-arrival services or advise the guest that our spa was fully booked. We are so very sorry that pasadenababy was unable to enjoy a stay at our historic inn.

We are glad this guest was able to fully enjoy our beautiful grounds, award-winning breakfast, and highly rated spa services. As always, we are surprised and saddened when we fall short of a guest’s expectations. I wish I had had the opportunity to discuss this guest’s concerns with them personally. Our General Manager or myself are always available to help resolve problems or misunderstandings a quickly and as amicably as possible. She was at the hotel until late in the evening on New Years eve and on New Years day.  As to our location, like almost all lodging establishments in Laguna Beach, Casa Laguna is located on Pacific Coast Highway. However, we are south of the bustling downtown district, in a relatively quiet residential neighborhood, between Laguna's only 4 star and 5 star resorts. This fact can be seen as a positive or negative aspect, depending on what guests are looking for, We are a historic bed & breakfast inn, catering to those who are looking for a romantic getaway or a peaceful respite. It is true that, even though we were able to outfit them with all the amenities discerning guests are now looking for, our rooms are on the small side.  We always encourage guests looking for larger rooms to consider our suites, a great value when space can be an issue. We are probably not necessarily a good fit for someone who prefers a luxury beachfront resort like the Surf & Sand.    The term private patio has a universal definition among hotels and inns. It means that you do not share your patio with another room. It does not mean that you can see out and no one can see in, and we know of no hotel patio in Laguna Beach that cannot be seen from other patios, buildings, or windows. The patio for Room 21 is one room back from PCH, and has a clear view of the ocean.  It is unclear from the remarks what the exact problem was with our staff. I have to assume it relates to the spa discount, and I apologize if the guest was unhappy with the way that was handled. The online spa special requires that the guest advise us of their intent to apply the discount at the time they make the reservation. There are also possible restrictions based on the length of stay, the date of reservation or other offers. We will always do our best to accommodate guests, as we appeared to do in this case, but to avoid such situation, we strongly suggest requesting discounts at the time of reservation.  As stated on on our website. high speed wireless internet is available in all rooms.  However, in rooms that are some distance from the router, some computers may not be able to get a strong signal. If a guest has this problem, and they do not want to bring their laptop to the patio or main house, we provide them with a CAT-5 cable so that they can use their computer in their room. As Luciferito mentioned, we also have a business center, and there is almost never a wait for the house computer.  Again, we want to thank this guest for their well-stated and honest feedback. Perhaps they will give us another try at a time when they can take a few moments to tour the property and see the variety of room types we have available, possibly choosing a room and location that is more to their liking.

Our policy, which allows the guest to cancel up to six days out is, in fact, far less severe than many that require up to 30 days. The cancelation policy is clearly stated on whatever resource the guest uses to make reservations, and our Innkeepers are trained to make sure the guest clearly understands the policy when reservations are made in-house. As we told this guest, we do occasionally make last minute exceptions for those experiencing significant adverse life-situations, such as death in the family, or when they cannot make it to the Inn due to events beyond their control, such as a canceled flight. Because 10-day weather forecasts are extremely accurate nowadays, we ordinarily expect that those who are concerned about the weather will cancel prior to five days out.  Lulumommy called to cancel just two hours before their expected arrival, saying they were afraid of mudslides and road closures. At the time of their expected arrival, and in the days following, there were no road closures or mudslides in Laguna Beach. Through the entire five days of the storm, there was never any problem with any of our guests getting to or from the airport. Some of our guests who decided not to venture out enjoyed chatting in front of the fire, playing games, and watching movies. Others had a massage, or enjoyed other spa amenities.   There is an obvious and significant difference between a guest who is legitimately discontented with his or her accommodations and one that cancels two hours before their expected arrival. We would never insist that a guest remain with us if they legitimately do not like the accommodations. And, as you can see from our overall feedback, unhappy guests are a rarity at Casa Laguna.  We agree with Lulumommy that all travelers should be aware of cancellation policies. Most people only learn about them when they need to cancel, and that can sometimes be unfortunate and costly. We have always been an advocate of travel insurance, which is well worth the cost, even if you only need it once in a dozen trips.   Finally, all of Casa Laguna’s front desk staff members are Innkeepers. As the proprietor, I am active in all elements of making sure the inn is properly run. However, as is the standard of the industry, the inn’s General Manager handles complaints and makes decisions regarding policy enforcement. These decisions are based on her knowledge of my wishes, and over 25 years of experience in the hospitality industry.   In this case, after discussing the incident at length with me, she contacted Lulumommy by phone, and I was under the impression that the guest understood our position.  As much as I understand Lulumommy’s frustration with the situation, I believe that, out of fairness to all our guests who abide by our policy, we did the right thing.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1128,62

The gift cards presented by the guest were, in fact, online-only gift cards that are, according to the issuing company, accompanied by instructions stating they must be used to make online reservations only. Unfortunately, the company did not inform us that they had issued this type of restricted card—and thus the panicked reaction of our staff member when they discovered the cards were not valid for this guest’s stay. I understand and sympathize with the distress of having pending transactions on a credit card, and we did work to rectify these issues as quickly as possible once we were made aware of the problem. We immediately contacted the credit card processing group, and offered to contact the guest’s bank directly for them to assure a prompt and accurate reimbursement. Steps have been taken to assure that this kind of situation will not happen again, including the retraining of staff to verify in advance the type of gift card that is being used; and to be more tactful and sensitive when handling these disconcerting predicaments.

Guest complaints regarding non-working amenities, such as CD players, are addressed and rectified as soon as we are advised of the situation.

It is therefore with great pleasure that I see the dedicated efforts of our innkeepers to make Casa Laguna “the perfect getaway” being recognized, and thank Lawyerup123 on their behalf for that recognition.  Nothing pleases us more than to know that the personal touch with which we welcome our guests has made a difference.  Unfortunately, it appears that this guest was disappointed by the size of his room and our location. Recognizing that there is little we can do about either, I would still like to reassure our prospective future guests that the size of our rooms is not an issue for the majority of our visitors and that our location is seen by most as ideal.  Our property, being a historic bed & breakfast inn, has some rooms that might appear small when compared with those of common “big box” hotels/resorts.  This being said, we are constantly complimented on the charm of our rooms, their comfort, and all of the amenities, including a small refrigerator, an ambiance fireplace, and a double jetted tub in those rooms where we were able to fit them in when we restored the inn. For guests concerned with space, we recommend our junior suites, which are much more spacious and represent an excellent value when you take into consideration all of the included amenities such as off-street parking, our award-winning gourmet breakfast, wine & cheese, high-speed internet, and access to our DVD library.  As for the location of our inn, most of our guests appreciate the fact that we are not in the middle of Laguna’s downtown congestion, yet we are just minutes from the area’s top restaurants, galleries, and the theater and festival grounds. We are just 1.7 miles from Laguna’s downtown “village” and Main Beach, and just one half-mile mile from great shops and restaurants. Also, the fact that we are located right between Laguna’s two most luxurious resorts, in an upscale residential neighborhood, is seen as an attribute by most of our guests. In addition, Victoria Beach, arguably one of Orange County’s most beautiful beaches--and a favorite of Lagunatics--is only a few minutes away by foot. Two wonderful restaurants, Dizz's as Is and Tabu Grill, are on the next block.  I am truly sorry that Lawyerip123 was not made aware of Laguna’s free trolley, since it indeed adds so much to the overall experience. We were instrumental in working with the Visitors Bureau and the City to implement this wonderful and ecological complimentary amenity, and informing guests about it is part of the personal tour we give each of them when they check in. Our staff always tends to play-up the convenience of the summer trolley, and I cannot explain why this was not done for this guest. I have, thanks to this comment, reminded our innkeepers of the importance of doing so.

Everyone was thanked for their patience while we took a step forward to make the Casa Laguna Inn & Spa a better destination for all our guests.  All guests were also encouraged to contact me if they had further comments about their experience at Casa Laguna.  With one exception, all the feedback I got from guests affected was positive, affirming kind and encouraging.  I received more than a dozen such responses and I shared them all with the terrific team here at Casa Laguna.  The one exception was from the guest who wrote this review.  As quickly as I received her note I responded thanking her for taking the time to share with me her experiences at the Casa Laguna and expressing my disappointment that she and her husband experienced the items she mentioned. Housekeeping is an extremely important aspect of any stay at our property and we have consistently earned high marks from the agencies which inspect us (AAA, Select Registry, OCHCA) as well as guests that leave comment cards.  I promised to immediately look into the circumstances associated with preparing the room in which she stayed on December 27 and take corrective action to ensure that we return to the high standards we have set for room cleaning and preparation.  We work closely and continually with our Pest Control Service provider.  I am pleased to report the Casa Laguna Inn & Spa is completely free of bed bugs.  We conduct professional inspections and apply treatments weekly to ensure we remain pest free.     Each room is equipped with a “plug-in” rechargeable flashlight that comes on automatically in the event of a power outage.  We will make sure to offer all guests additional candles and flashlights in the event of a power outage in the future.  We maintain a supply of both candles and flashlights in the Mission House and lobby.  I am disappointed that the team and I were not able to offer the experience this guest expected.

People who enjoy staying in crowded, bustling, modern hotels with identical bulk-purchased contemporary furniture in every room will very likely be disappointed with Casa Laguna’s Old World charm. We are constantly upgrading and improving our rooms, and many changes have been made since 2008. As to overflowing toilets – rest assured that is not a common problem at Casa Laguna—but, hotels occasionally have that problem because people sometimes flush things they shouldn’t.  As a historic, romantic inn, we readily admit that we are not appropriate for families, and we make that clear in our promotions and at the time reservations are made.

What was nice however was the free trolley that stops right outside every 20 minutes.   Originally when I booked the room I had snagged the last room available- this was a few weeks in advance, so originally I didn't mind that it was a smaller room.

All prospective guests should be aware that it is the standard of the industry to collect the full value of the first night’s stay in advance as a way to avoid possible lost revenue due to no-shows.  We caution all travelers, regardless of where they plan to stay, to always read the hotel/inn’s policies regarding upfront payment and cancelation fees.  Casa Laguna is a historic property that has been fully renovated, with additional renovation having taken place since this review was written. We always advise prospective guests that we have a wide variety of rooms in a variety of sizes. Some of our rooms are small, and only a very few have small showers. We encourage our guests to advise us immediately if their room is not what they expected. Based on availability, we are frequently able to move the guest to a room that better fits their criteria. That said, we have many returning guests who love the smaller, quaintly appointed rooms that are reminiscent of the period when Casa Laguna was an artist colony.   Our inn is regularly inspected and treated by an extermination service, keeping within the guidelines that allow us to retain our status as a wildlife sanctuary. We are located in a damp climate and we have lush gardens that do sometime attract pesky insects. However, insects are rarely seen in the rooms.   I am at a loss to understand this guest’s complaints regarding breakfast. A full gourmet breakfast is, in fact, served daily from 7:30 to 10:30, and the only time I have known of it being delayed was when we had problems with our oven. As this guest points out, we provide a menu of culinary selections. Most B&B’s offer one or two. Even in 2008, our guests raved about the quality and variety of our breakfasts, and we have now developed a reputation as a foodie destination.   And finally, as suggested by surfergirl831, we invite our guests to think twice about their stay here--once when they arrive and see the beautiful grounds, then slumber on luxurious linens and rise to experience a one-of-a-kind gourmet breakfast; and once again when they get back home and recall their special time at Casa Laguna.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1201,62

Historic Pacific Coast Highway is the only way to get to most of the beach towns and accommodations along the Orange County coast. We make it clear on our web site that we sit on the inland side of the highway. Only a rare few guests are bothered by road noise, as you can tell by our many positive reviews, but if you are particularly sensitive to the mild drone of traffic passing, we may not be the place for you.  We are a historic property that was once an artist colony. Thus, we boast magnificent architecture and beautifully terraced gardens. Some of our rooms are small. Others are not. We encourage you to carefully peruse our web site to learn more about our room types and their location on the property. If you have any questions or concerns, give us a call, and we’ll help you decide whether or not we meet your criteria. As to the layout and décor of our rooms, again, the great majority of our guests are very happy with the furniture and amenities. The rooms are inspected regularly, and repairs and upgrades are always a priority. The problems noted by this guest were repaired as soon as we were made aware of them.  As for the mentioned patio, like most patios at inns and hotels, it is next door to another patio. Yes, it is highly possible that if your neighbor sneezes, you are likely to hear it.   We are a bed & breakfast inn. We serve an award-winning gourmet breakfast, about which our guests rave. We can do bacon and eggs and toast for those who lack an appreciation for gourmet fare. However, we are probably not the place for those who want an oversized family breakfast with biscuits and gravy. Our evening wine and cheese reception includes a wide variety of light gourmet goodies, not just cheese and crackers. We provide plenty for everyone, but it is not intended as a substitute for dinner.  Unfortunately, swimming pools require occasional maintenance, which can sometimes take longer than hoped for. Our beautiful pool is an amenity that is open all but a few days each year—far more than in most parts of the country—and whenever possible, we always advise guests of expected closures in advance of their arrival. The same is true for inevitable upgrades and renovation—which is always done mid-day, and with great attention to minimal intrusion on our guest’s comfort.  And finally, we do not have a problem with rodents. We are in a somewhat damp oceanfront climate that insects love.

At least they were able to enjoy one of our beautiful gourmet breakfasts.  As to the airing out of rooms – it is not uncommon for some guests to spend several days at the inn without opening windows or even using the air conditioning. As you can imagine, after some clothing changes and a few showers, the room can get a bit stale. We have found a great air freshening system that helps to clear the problem, along with opening doors and windows. We like to have everything aired out and ready before new guests arrive, but, unfortunately, during busy periods, we sometimes have to wait until the last minute to pull the units and close things up. This is especially problematic if we are trying to accommodate an early arrival.  The problem of early departures and cancellations is one that every hotel faces, but it is especially a problem for smaller inns like Casa Laguna. In order to avoid financial setbacks, we find ourselves having to strongly enforce our policies, which sometimes leads to unhappy consequences. It is impossible to make an exception without the appearance of preferentialism.  That is why we make multiple efforts to assure that guests are aware of those policies before they make their reservation. And, we continue to tout the benefits of inexpensive, but oh-so-valuable, travel insurance.   Finally, we cannot apologize enough for those rare occasions when one of our staff members fails to perform as we expect, which, in cases like this, result in retraining or, if necessary, replacement.

The permit for the project taking place while this guest was with us came without warning from the City and we were faced with the opportunity to get the work done, starting immediately, or delay the project for an entire year without a guarantee that the project would be reauthorized by the City.

I regret that we were unable to meet this guest’s expectations.  I am grateful she took the time and made the effort to share her experiences with us at the hotel and here in this forum.  We share the same goal of setting potential guest’s expectations accurately and reasonably for what an experience at the Casa Laguna is like.    As we do for all guests who provide us feedback, we promptly acknowledged this guest’s initial feedback and thanked her for taking the time to provide it.  In cases when we receive critical feedback we also: - Apologize for not meeting the guest’s expectations - Explain the lengths to which we go to and methods we employ to set expectations accurately - Make a pledge to do better in the future  - Offer some form of incentive should the guest be willing to give us a second chance  In this case, the guest subsequently responded with a more strongly worded e-mail expressing her dissatisfaction with our offer and a threat to post bad reviews in online forums.   At that point I felt it inappropriate to acknowledge her threat or offer her what she was seeking.  I hoped that she would post an accurate and complete review of her experience at Casa Laguna.  It is our policy to encourage all guests to share their experiences at the Casa Laguna accurately and fully with other potential guests.  We feel it is best way to set expectations and make sure that guests for whom the Casa Laguna is a peaceful, romantic retreat get to experience just that.  For the benefit of all potential guests, I feel it important to point out some of the challenges this guest experienced from the perspective of the service provider.    1)  We politely request that guests not operate the motors on their jetted tubs after 11:00 pm as there is some noise and vibration that can be heard or felt in nearby rooms.  Our request to not run the motors after 11:00 pm does not reference running the water.  Indeed, our entire plumbing system, including on-demand hot water heaters, is state of the art and energy efficient.  We make this request for the benefit, comfort and peaceful enjoyment of the overwhelming majority of our guests.  Our historic, romantic property may not be a good fit for guests who wish to make potentially disturbing noise after 11:00 pm.    2)  We provide a wine and cheese service every evening between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm.  The time at which that service concludes is well published on our website, in every reservation confirmation letter and e-mail we send and reiterated to guests when we show them to their rooms at check-in.  Only subsequent to this service do our innkeepers turn their attention to providing assistance to guests in other areas.  In this particular case, the guests arrived more than 30 minutes after the service concluded and made their request abruptly, interrupting an innkeeper who was assisting other guests.    3)  We offer all guests assistance with their luggage at arrival and upon departure.  This service is a condition of our membership with the Select Registry and is offered automatically to all guests.  We are subjected to frequent, random, anonymous quality assurance inspections on which this service is evaluated and we have never received a grade below “Satisfactory” for this service.  Prior to reading this review, the guest’s desire to have assistance with her luggage had not been brought to the attention of anyone at Casa Laguna.  Had she presented herself to the front desk or to any innkeeper on property at any time during her stay requesting assistance, it would have been provided with all haste.  As well, if she participated in check-in or check-out with any member of our front desk staff, she would twice have been offered this assistance.   It was my hope that through sincere acknowledgement of her critique and concerns and with an offer of a significant incentive to give us a second chance, this guest would appreciate the lengths to which we at the Casa Laguna are willing to go to ensure the satisfaction of our guests.  Instead, she chose to threaten us with a bad review if we didn’t meet her demands.   It is now my hope that potential guests with expectations similar to hers are appropriately warned away from booking at the Casa Laguna.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1250,62

It's a nice B&B, but given",November 2005,none,none,"We always welcome comments from guests who have experienced Casa Laguna and pay particular attention to the ones where our guests felt we did not live up to our reputation of great service and hospitality. Through our many years of inn keeping, we have come to recognize that even with all our efforts to provide the best experience possible, there will be times when it will be impossible to satisfy some guests.  We always strive to see how we can improve the Casa Laguna experience and will look hard into sometimes harsh criticisms to find what can be learned from them.   I understand that all the awards and media attention our complimentary gourmet breakfast has gathered over the years create expectations sometimes hard to meet.  We take that challenge to heart and constantly monitor the quality of our offerings and welcome constructive criticism on improving it. But, more than the outside recognition, it is the daily kudos from satisfied guests that allow me to feel very proud of what our chefs serve every day.  Ingardia is the largest provider of produce, seafood, and groceries in Orange County. Their clients include well-known Orange County restaurants such as Watermarc Grill, 230 Forest, Mark’s, Antonello Restorante, and Anaheim’s famous White House. They also service the widely respected Laguna Culinary Arts facility here in Laguna Beach. As for our chef’s appearance, it is true that, like many of the world’s top chefs, Chef Josh Roberts has tattoos and sometimes sports a five o’clock shadow. All of our chefs show up each day properly groomed and neatly dressed in freshly washed uniforms.   As mentioned before, like almost all properties in Laguna Beach, we are located on Coast Highway, a four lanes street.  Traffic noise, which dies at night and will not start only until the next morning, is only a problem for a handful of our guests who are more sensitive to noise.  To those, we always recommend a room or a suite located further back on the property.   It’s also true that we are not on the beach, something we make very clear on our website and when presenting Casa Laguna to prospective guests.  Still, we agree with our many guests who feel that the thousand steps to Victoria Beach or Moss Beach, arguably two of the most beautiful beaches in Orange County and favorites of locals, are well worth the 5 to 10 minute walk.   In conclusion, I sincerely regret that he did not offer us the option to rectify the situation for them.  We would have done all we can to satisfy him.
