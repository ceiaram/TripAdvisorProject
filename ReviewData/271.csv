We were looking to get out of the cold Utah winter and find a warm, romantic spot. For background, we have stayed in some cheap places and some expensive places in many countries over 40 years. As others have said, this can be a somewhat expensive stay (for us), and my only concern in making the reservation was whether it would live up to my expectations.  And it did.  I judge success by my wife’s reaction and she loved it. As full disclosure, we booked the luxury tower suite, Room 301, so not all of the rooms would have the same location or layout. I should also mention that many locals told us that this had been the best weather of the winter – highs in the 70’s and no clouds – and",February 2023,none,none,Wow!

The BLI overlooks the Harbor and ocean and has specialty rooms that are cozy. Some have fireplaces which are great for winter evenings overlooking the ocean. Some have sitting areas outside and are private. Wine is served at Happy Hour and the Ladies who check you in are very helpful.

We had stayed at the inn about 10 years ago and had recommended it to friends and family in the interim. We were using a gift card and so we splurged and reserved a partial ocean view, room 205. The room had just been recarpeted with an indoor outdoor type carpet and by the time we checked out it was lifting off the pad and big ripples could be seen across the floor. The wine and cheese were very nice and we really enjoyed watching a young couple take wedding photos at the viewpoint in front of the hotel. Little did we know that the wedding was a stones throw from our balcony and that deafening music from the reception would be blaring until 10:00pm. So much for romance.

It had many advantages to other hotels in town.  We had scouted most of them in preparation for family members that would be coming in from out of town.  The Blue Lantern is a beautiful hotel, with a walkway connecting to Cannons and free parking.  The free parking is a big plus considering most hotels charge upwards of $12 per night for self parking.  What a rip-off!    We had 3 rooms booked at the inn.  2 city view rooms for out of town guests and a harbor view room for us.  Now this is where my surprise came in.  Since the harbor view room was more expensive, I expected it to be nicer than the city view rooms.  But that was not the case.

This is a charming inn that sits on a bluff over the Dana Point Harbor, quiet, relaxing and with great views and a great staff. We spent our anniversay there in a Pacific Edge Room - worth the extra money for the patio and view. Tower Rooms are also beautiful but much more expensive. Room was very large, jacuzzi tub was great. Breakfast was juice, cereal, fruit, bagels, breads, fresh muffins, hard boiled eggs and quiche --quite tasty.  Afternoon wine and cheese, fruit and sweets also very nice. Coffee, lemonade and cookies always available. Staff does a very good job. They made dinner reservations for us and had ideas of things to do. Beach and marina is a very, very long walk...and it's all uphill to get back -- better to drive which will only",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,610,271
