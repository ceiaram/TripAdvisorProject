My special requests were all granted so I was pleased. The main complaint I have is that there was no bathtub. My daughter was scared of the shower because she never used one before so for all 3 nights she was terrified. For little kids a shower-only bathroom is not a good option.  The pool and spa were good sizes. It was always crowded though. One afternoon there was a group of over a dozen adults sitting and a dozen boys diving in the pool and tossing balls around. It was dangerous for my child. None of the parents said a word to their unruly kids.  Breakfast was OK. The same items were served for all 3 days we were there.

1 helpful vote,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,felt like home nice hotel,I was here over the weekend. I stayed next door at the Fairfield inn for two days and here for three. This place was sold out one night . Great place. The lounge was really nice and you can tell they put a lot of money in this place. This hotel really was great. The weather was perfect 80 degrees everyday. I just came from Kansas where it was 95 . Beds are really comfortable . I don't have one complaint about this place. They spent a lot of money on the little details on this hotel.  I stay at 50 different Marriott a year on business and this was definitely the cleanest hotel I have stayed at. You don't have a ocean view or anything but I really like it.,August 2013,none,none,Thank you for giving us a look and we appreciate your kind words!

I arrived around 11am on day of check in and they had my room ready early for me. That was really nice. They really went out of there way to be helpful. The lounge was really nice and relaxing. The room I stayed in was great, clean and pretty large. The location on this place is perfect. I don't have a beach view or anything but its really in a great location. I went to the beach one day and it only took 15 to 20 minutes. The final day of my trip I went to downtown Disney and it only took 15 minutes. I have stayed at some of the other Marriotts in the area and they are pretty outdated. I would highly recommend this hotel. It just opened and it was super clean",August 2013,none,none,"We are really happy that you enjoyed your stay!  We can‚Äôt say it enough times, but thank you for being a Platinum Member.

I booked 4 nights (Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday) while working long hours in town. I checked in very late and went straight to bed. When I woke up in the morning I noticed that the housekeeper had left the used soap (with a hair on it) and shampoo in the shower. There were also long, dark hairs on the bathroom floor. I complained to the housekeeping manager who was very apologetic and assured me the problem would be corrected.  I returned late and noticed the used soap was gone but the hairs were still on the floor. Not only that the shower was dripping and could not be turned off. It appeared the housekeeper noticed that and angled the shower head up rather than notifying maintenance. I",August 2013,none,none,Thank you for staying with us and taking the time to comment on your stay.  My sincere apologies for the issues with housekeeping you experienced.
