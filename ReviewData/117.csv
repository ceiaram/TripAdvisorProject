none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Run! Run away fast!,"To be honest this was a last minute booking. And now I know why they had rooms available. Worst place ever. Disgusting and extremely rude staff. Keys never worked right. Lack of bedding and uncomfortable bedding. Both kids got bit by a spider. Oh my gross! Called down to front desk to ask for extra pillows. There was 4 of us. I was told “there is a king bed in the room and you have 4 pillows on that bed. You take 2 of those pillows and use them for the kids”. Have in mind these are small pillows.

A little closer to walk to Disneyland would be nice but I can’t complain with the price and quality of the room.  La Quinta breakfast is always pretty mediocre quality, but for free it gets up by until lunch.  I was impressed that at this stay they had upgraded to actual brewed coffee over the machines with instant that they usually have.  If they upgrade their powdered “scrambled” eggs and offer real butter it will be a welcome improvement.

My friends and I purposely booked this hotel because we had booked a room with 4 beds (2 full size beds + 1 twin + 1 trundle), and we had 4 adult women staying at the hotel. You can imagine our surprise when we checked in and found a crappy sofa bed in lieu of the trundle beds. I called the front desk and they told us that they'd over sold and bumped us from our room, but didn't bother to tell us before checking in. We asked for a rollaway bed, and they told us they apparently don't have rollaways. What kind of hotel doesn't have a rollaway bed?! Fine.

The hotel does charge for parking but is less than what other hotels charge.  It is a good value for where it is located.

Filthy small bathrooms with cigarette burns on the bathtub in my non-smoking room! Extremely noisy also. Front desk staff is rude and push park tram tickets on you when disneyland is within close walking distance. Hot breakfast is a joke. Powdered eggs shaped in round circles, very crowded and small breakfast room. I would never stay there again.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1327,117

The pull out sofa was so old you could feel the springs and bars.  The carpet had burn marks and filthy.  The breakfast that claimed waffles or french toast plus -was for four days eggs, bacon, bagels, toast and cereal only.  One day there was nothing to drink because the drink machines leaked water all over the floor.  The jacuzzi water was discustingly dirty and the pool didn't look much better.  They also checked us out of our room early while we were at breakfast the last day we where.

We thought the room was spacious and kept clean.  The bathroom was small but useable.  The breakfast buffet was something else.  You always had scrambled eggs with either bacon or sausage.  Not a choice of one or the other but whatever was in the wamer when you got there.  If you arrived early enough you might get small chocolate donuts left in their container like you get from a Sams or Costco.  There was only one cereal and no muffins or fruit.  In the afternoon you had popcorn for the managers reception and that was about it.  If you stayed on the weekdays I understand you had a better selection. The shuttle bus driver was rude and you had to let them know way ahead of time when you wanted to",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1329,117

One room can accomadate a very large family. Also the free breakfast was great. It is not your common continenal breakfast. It has sausage, waffles, muffins, fresh fruit, and much more. The only bad thing is the frequency of their shuttle and the fact they charge you for it.

8 helpful votes,2 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Find a different hotel!,"Our family just returned from a 7 night stay at this hotel and we were rather disappointed. We had booked adjoining rooms with friends so that we could put our kids (each family has a baby and a 6 year old) to bed and stay in one of the living areas to watch tv or play some cards. The room divider is a wobbly sliding door with a shear curtain cover which blocks out no light or sound. THe sofa bed was missing many springs, the bed spread was so old and dirty loking, the sheets and blankets were very old too. Our bathroom kept having puddles of water from the ceiling dripping and they couldn't figure out why. Our tv remote did not work and the replacement we were given only turned then one direction so you had to flip all the way thru.

This hotel is dirty and the service is horrible. The blankets had holes in them and looked like they hadn't been washed in quite some time. The coffee maker didn't work, we were left with no towels or washclothes on 2 separate nights and when we called for them they were never delivered. Two of our cars were broken into and all of the Christmas presents stolen while there was supposed to be a security guard on duty. When another person who also had their car vandalized, asked for help at the front desk, they handed her a phone book and offered no assistance. The police told us it would have been safer if we would have parked at Disneyland and left our cars there. I think that says a lot for the",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1332,117

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great deal for a large family!,We have stayed at Hawthorne Suites on several occasions & found it to be comparable to even the Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel. A better bargain at any rate. We have a large family & was able to sleep comfortably in the spacious rooms & a wonderful breakfast in the morning. The kids enjoyed swimming in the rather small pool. We are all there to go visit Disneyland & I think this Hotel was the best bargain ever! The rooms were clean & nicely furnished.

8 helpful votes,8 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Not worth the savings,"My family (7;my 4 kids & 3 adults) stayed July 6-9 in 2 rooms and what a shock. The last time we had stayed here was a 5 years ago (which we informed by the check in personal when the hotel was last renovated!) it was a lovely place and a great deal. Not any longer, the rooms are very shabby, the furniture damaged and worn, walls stained and marked with dirt and handprints on the ceiling. The bathrooms (we changed our rooms which were adjoining twice) were moldy and water damaged probably because the venting system was nonexistant, it helps to shower with the door open I guess. We needed are rooms together so when we found the one of the doors inbetween the rooms wouldn't open we had to wait to have the lock removed since it couldn't be repaired.

3 helpful votes,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,this place was terrible!,"I'm not a picky person but this place was terrible. Perhaps my sister & I were just cursed that weekend but we had nothing but problems! It started with my mistake of assuming check in was at 11 or 12 so we took an early flight. Check in was not until 3:00. My fault. Next we bought our disneyland hopper passes there and asked if they had a shuddle, yes they said, go wait outside it comes every twenty minutes. We go outside and wait, then the maintenence man walks by & we ask if this is where we catch the shuddle, no around back he says, which explained why we just saw it driving away. So we go around back and wait another 20 minutes, they arrive and ask us for our shuddle passes. What shuddle passes? We were never told we needed them. So the shuddle driver says I'm on a schedule",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1338,117
