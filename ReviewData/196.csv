This hotel is located very close to the airport and a great place for business travelers. The hotel is hip, fun, and  has a good environment for after hours in the M Club lounge. I was very impressed by the lounge as it had great snacks and offerings. What I don’t understand about the lounges in America (or just the property lounges in general) is that everywhere else in the world seems to provide you with free beer and wine but the lounges in America do not. That should definitely be something that should change. Another thing about this hotel is the naming of the rooms. The ‘Penthouse’ room on the highest 17th floor is misleading.
