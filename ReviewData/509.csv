This place is forcing me to put a bad review to protect other travelers from the nightmare of this place.   The evening manager was rude and he made threats directly to me. Al disputes I had about my stay was answered with ""I will call the police"".   The rooms are old and disgusting. Germs, grems and more germs. Arrrr!  I asked for a refund after only being there for one hour the answer was ""I will call the police"" and NO..NO...NO...what a nasty man.  If you have even one friend or business partner to the room you will be asked to leave with no refund and the police will be called.

When we arrived all the hotel's were booked, Except Ana Mesa Inn. They said they only had one room left, so we took it. A "" jacuzzi  suite"".  It was a jacuzzi tub with a hand held shower head attached. The tub had black mold growing in the jets. There was cat crap on the floor at the head of the bed. They wanted 5 dollars if we were to get an extra card for the room. The staff was rude. They didn't care about the mold, cat crap, and cockroaches or  that nobody cleaned the  room. That wasn't their problem. At check out time, we Received a call from the front desk saying we were late checking out and that they were telling us to get out.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Bad customer service.,Check in was great. We got to the room it smelled funky  like the ac need to get be replace but nothing major. We were really tired from looking and looking at different places different hotels they were all sold out so we felt this was a our last option. We got charged like around $95. A bit pricy for a standard room. Upon check out I ran into Mr.  Panduka also known as manager. I walk to the front desk and I approached him to purchase a box of cigarettes. So he sent me back to get a photo ID I walk back to my room and grab my keys I'm back to my car to grab my ID. As I approached him I accidentally used slang WORD. And he said he didn't like the way I was talking to him. After all the cigarettes were $8.00 when you can get them at the gas station cheaper.

The reception attendant serves you from behind glass. The attendant upsold me to the ""Jucuzzi sweet"" which was no more than a large tub bath with hose -- not even a shower. The carpet was old, sticky and dirty and the air conditioner rattled and didn't work properly. During the night my door was knocked on several times and when I opened it on one occasion a drug affected individual said ""sorry man wrong room"". I could smell marijuana throughout the premises. Avoid this place at all costs. It isn't cheap either.",June 2013,none,Traveled solo,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,509

Our first room was awful, ants everywhere, walls peeling and falling off, tv didnt work, water damage. So they moved us into another room or a ""suite"" it was bigger but just as bad. Ants in the room, shower didnt work, sent someone to fix the shower and the entire bathroom needs to be replaced. We asked for as refund and they refused, they gave us another room to use for a shower and as soon as we walked in all we saw were bed bugs crawling everywhere, roaches, and ants. We decided to just not take the shower and live with it. I would rather sleep on a park bench than this hole. Staff are complete jerks.

8 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Warning,"After reading published information on various web sites, I called the hotel directly.  The person who answered the phone said the only room available was an ""upscale"" jacuzzi room for much more than the price listed on any web site.  When I balked, he said that another room might become available at a more moderate price, but still much more than internet prices.  When I inquired about the internet price, he said that his hotel did not work with any internet sites and that you could not trust the information listed thereon.  From other reviews I have read, he is correct.  All the web sites listing this hotel call it a ""hidden jewel"".

32 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Not your  Average Hotel....,"We booked two rooms at the Ana Mesa Suites hotel via the RedTagHotels website in October 2002. That site, along with others, describes Ana Mesa Suites as ""a hidden jewel of hospitality"".   It has reason to hide...  We hadn't seen the property, and were (at the time) unfamiliar with Costa Mesa. However, we did check out the area surrounding the property.  It was an upscale business park;  we figured this hotel would be a typical business travelers establishment.  Uh--wrong!    The lobby prominently featured a ""no room parties"" sign. Furniture and other junk was piled around the postage stamp sized pool. The room decor was no doubt posh in the early 1970's, but could not have been updated since. Everything was dirty, and there was a distinct odor of urine in the elevator.  The",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,8,509
