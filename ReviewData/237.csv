What time I did spend was comfortable clean and quiet- the three things I look for in a hotel. The television channels were plenty and they didn't waste money on all the stuff you never use. Plenty of parking and easy on/off the highway. They had a beautiful pool which I didn't use, but was in use most of the time i was there. The breakfast is not much, but I usually purchase food elsewhere anyhow. The staff was very nice and accommodating (The AC was a little off which they fixed immediately and kept me nice and cool the rest of my stay).

Which is completely correct.        Had the Red Roof Inn at Buena Park however, listed among  its amenities that in addition to microwaves and refrigerators, continental breakfast and hi-fi that they had roaches; then I too would agree.       In fact, we did pay a low price which was a great find, or so my husband and I thought initially. The hotel was one of the lower priced among several, so close to Knotts Berry Farm.   But  apparently, not  enough money to handle a roach infestation.       If that problem would have been resolved professionally, I would not be writing a review so lengthy. Imagine finding roaches crawling on the walls, finding a few roaches roaming",March 2008,none,none,"ROACHES  We take roach issues VERY seriously.  We have an ongoing, monthly contract with a professional pest control company, IsoTech Pest Management to inspect our building for any sort of roaches.  They inspect ten individual rooms each month and place traps throughout the building.  The room was also inspected by our staff that night, and no signs of roaches were found.  No other complaints have been received about roaches from that room.  RUDE FRONT DESK STAFF  We have since talked to and corrected the Front Desk Staff member.  Never do we tolerate rude behavior from our staff.  This Front Desk Staff member is no longer employed at the hotel.  HOTEL MANAGER'S RESPONSE  Whenever there are guest complaints, we do what we can to resolve them to the satisfaction of the guest.  In this case, we did offer the guest a free upgrade to one of our Suites, but the offer was refused.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR?  Though this property may be on the ""cheaper"" side, you can feel confident that you will be able to address any issues directly to management and the owner, as the owner is on property nearly every day.  Your issues will not be ignored and we will work with you to resolve them.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1019,237

The rooms are clean, the staff is somewhat friendly, the cleaning crew is really friendly, and the place is quiet. Our room was a 2 queens with a micro-fridge.  The only problem with that, is that the only rooms that come with the micro-fridge are on the 4th level, and the hotel only has 2 elevators, that were not even close to our room. Other than that, there is really no complaints, the location is awesome, matter of fact, the hotel shares the same parking lot as a target, which is really convenient. I would definately return to this place, and recommend it to others.",February 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1020,237

We booked a non-smoking room however our room smelled of smoke (not surpirsed since this seems to be a common problem at a lot of hotels). The good thing was that Target is right behind the hotel so we went to buy some Febreeze and sprayed it, turned up the ACC, opened the door and window, and this took care of most of the smell. The room seemed clean, however, this is a hotel that accepts pets and we were traveling with my 2 year old so I made sure that he was not playing on the floor. The carpet is dark so you can't see if there are any stains on the floor and who knows how often they deep clean those carpets.

Probably 30 minute drive from LAX. Standard 2 queens bed room, good for family of 2 Adults + 2 kids. Located on same development is a Black Steer steakhouse, and a Dennys (outside which there's public telephones from which you can dial direct to UK - found this to be the exception in CA, where a lot of public phones are US only - or go through the operator). Public transport bus from the street outside to Disney ($1 fare), so handy for that. Kids loved the pool - but we're British/Irish and are easily pleased, especially if the sun is shining !

In fact, I went ahead and made a reservation at another nearby hotel in case it was too scary to go in. I gave it a shot, though, because this room was only $45 compared with $75 at Hampton Inn. I was only staying one night with my two preschoolers, so I wanted something clean and safe. The lobby was clean and nice, and the elevator to our room was accessed through the lobby, which made me feel a bit safer. The room was nothing special, but it had the basics (beds, tv, table, chairs, tub and shower combo). Everything looked fairly updated and clean. My nonsmoking room did not smell of smoke or anything else. The only problem I had was that the window",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1026,237
