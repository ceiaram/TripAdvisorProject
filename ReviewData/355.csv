Combative, rude owner that doesn't listen. Sets arbitrary rules and screams at you if you didn't obey. Better off at a cheap chain that has some sort of standards.",September 2022,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,355
1 helpful vote,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Pretty cool place.,"It was quiet. The room was clean. Lady at check in was nice. They do only let one car per room, but in reality, that's reasonable. We only had to stay one night. If you just need a place to rest your head for the night, I recommend it.",October 2016,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,355

Only issue is weak WiFi signal which they are currently trying to improve. I'll be back, you can't beat the price.",August 2016,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,355

Was without wifi for a day and was accused of lying then they realised it wasn't working and fixed it. Came here to relax and how can you relax when they watch you 24/7. Then go to park your car in front your room and told to move your car because they want to see the fkreworks....really??,July 2015,Probably don't waste your time!,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,355
