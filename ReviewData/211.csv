With that said, they also have a kitchen that would be expected for an extended stay place, without much of the seedier parts of some (the stairwell could use an occasional sweeping, though).

When my party and I returned to the hotel our first night after dinner there was a group of 5 or 6 men drinking in the hotel parking lot in the dark. I reported it to the front desk and they appeared disinterested. The entire third floor smelled like marijuana on Saturday evening.

2 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,My opinion of Extended stay America' Hotel.,Exceptional service. Great low prices. Best bang for your buck. The bed was comfortable and the towels folded like swans at end of bed when first entering the room was neat And clean as well. For the uptight yuppy you probably would complain about the thread count of sheets and be petty about stuff that really isn't a big deal. But for the grateful regardless economic status would be grateful and enjoy themselves. I can only speak for myself and i think the chair in the corner next to the window is super comfortable. The bed did its job as a bed. Just wish i had a coffee maker. Unless its in a cupboard i didn't see it. But a coffee maker would make this a perfect stay for the perfect price.

However, having 'Anaheim Convention Center' in the title is a little misleading as there are at least a dozen or more hotels closer to the Convention Center than this one. It's probably a good half mile away, so you can count on footing it for a mile round trip unless you drive or take a cab. Parking is free, so that's another plus as many of the closer hotels charge for parking. Really. The rooms were so so, but weren't bad. The bed was very comfortable. If you need clean towels, it's a simple matter of bringing the used ones to the front desk and getting fresh ones. Housekeeping is once a week.

I’ll start my review with the positives: Friendly staff – The older gentleman checking us in was very nice and chatty.  The younger gentleman working in the morning restocked the breakfast area for us as it had been picked over.  Both were friendly throughout our stay, conversating with us on occasion about the area and parks. Price – This place was $500 cheaper than our usual hotel during the Spring Break period.  We paid $390 for five nights which included a weekend stay!       Location – I felt safe walking to and from the parks each day with my family.

My friend who is disabled  could not get her prescription filled. Jay, on his own time was kind enough  to take her prescription to the pharmacy and fill it for her.

I booked more than 1 month in advance.  Called to request a non smoking room due to a medical condition.  Was met with nothing but resistance when I contacted the hotel...also when I contacted Priceline.  However, when I called back during normal Ca hours ( and someone who didn't speak broken English) the matter was promptly resolved by Sonia.  I believe she is a true asset to this hotel.  Sonia was also the one who checked us in promptly and politely and delivered the room promised.  Rooms were amazing!!!

Finding a comfortable reasonably priced room is not always easy. But I found Extended Stay and read that they'd remodeled. The pictures looked good and the price was perfect. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted, and the lobby looked fantastic. Our room was nicely updated, all the way from the curtains, to the closet, to the floors, to the entire bathroom. The decor is great, the upgrades are beautiful, and we couldn't have been closer to Disneyland! My only gripe was the lack of lotion, shampoo and a hair dryer in our room, but the staff remedied that quickly.
