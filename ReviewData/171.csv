We wanted a nice, cheap place stay near Anaheim for a short getaway to Disneyland.    We found this place to be the cheapest of the Holiday Inn group.  Luckily we got there at 10:40 because the front desk closes at 11pm.    At almost 11, we realized that the pillows were ULTRA soft and definitely needed more for support.  We called the front desk to ask for more and they told us we had to go to the front to get it.  I was in shock...apparently their housekeeping is only done once a week on each room, so if you need something you have to ask.  Fair enough...sent my boyfriend up to the front to grab the pillows.  He comes back with two pillows and two pillow cases.  For what i paid, i dont think I should have",May 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,161,171
12 helpful votes,5 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible...smelled like smoke,"This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in...and I have stayed in at least 20. First of all, the hotel assigns me a smoking room when I specifically asked for a non-smoking room. I head up to the room and notice the hallway reaks of smoke. When I go to my room the key doesn't work...they gave me the wrong room number. I then trek down back to the check-in area (not staffed because it is at night...another horrible thing about this hotel.). When I get back to the check-in area I find the staffer left my paper with all my personal information on the counter for ANYONE to grab. (This includes my credit card number.) If I hadn't came back down who knows who would have grabbed it. After getting the correct room number I finally made it to my room.

We stayed on the ground floor.  The bed was OK, but I think it was just a full size.  The sofa bed was OK for small kids but would have been terrible for an adult.  The carpets were so filthy that our feet got dirty; however the carpets were being cleaned on the day we checked out. The rooms were set up with handicap access in mind: the bathroom sink and toilet were the type you would find in a handicap accessible restroom.  The latch on the door was well within reach of our 4-year-old.  There was a nightstand in the bedroom only on one side.  The bar for hanging clothes in the closet was also very low and full length clothes would drag on the floor. I",February 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,163,171

When I called to advise we would need beds for 3 people, this place wanted another $30/night per room. Rollaways are $10, however not generally available.   This was not good news to me, but it got worse. Housekeeping takes place only AFTER 7 NIGHTS. And, there is no staff in the office in the evenings or at night.

There were eight of us in three studio style suites all next to each year. Things that we enjoyed about our stay.... 1. Location- Near the highway but also close enough to Disney that we could stop at TARGET for supplies and 7-eleven for snacks. We didn't mind the drive because it gave our two children (2 and 7) a chance to fall asleep. 2. Kitchen- We loved this feature! It came it helpful for juice, water and snacks. We made ice for your water bottles for the park. We also were able to make the kids breakfast which was a real money saver.  3.

The suites are very small and designed to be studio apartment style living for business travelers. The hotel does not provide daily maid service, toiletries in the bathroom, extra towels (we had to bring and use our own), there is not a swimming pool or access to ART shuttle to Disneyland. The hotel is about three miles from Disneyland and you need to drive or take a taxi to and from. The kitchen is minimally equipped, OK for snacks but not to prepare a meal.

32 helpful votes,40 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,It Works Well for Two,"This hotel is near freeways and is a drivable distance to Disneyland. For all Priceline reservations, you get a studio with ONE queen bed (the hotel has a written policy stating it; the people in front of us argued, so I got to see it). This room set up works for two people who will sleep in the bed together. Sleeping bags on the floor would be crowded. The bed is adequate quality, but not that comfortable. Reading lights are on one side of the bed only, if you're on the other side, you have no light. There is a comfortable recliner in the room, but it needed to be replaced, there were holes in the fabric.   The kitchenette is extremely convenient, with a full size fridge, 2-burner cooktop, microwave and a dishwasher.

It was a fairly new building, clean, with kitchen utensils provided (but no pots/pans) and has a recliner. The bed was ok, something that you would expect from a $50/nite lodging (we got a great deal from Orbitz). They also let you borrow movies from the front desk (but the selection is limited). There's laundry & workout room downstairs too. The only downside is that we don't feel that the area was safe at nite (although we didn't encounter any problems).

You can do MUCH better in the Disneyland area...and we have. This is the first bad experience with Priceline for this area in three visits.  1) Location: Candlewood is NOT in the Anaheim Resort area. It is miles away just off another freeway next to a Holiday Inn Express in Garden Grove. This is a hotel for a single person too tired to drive anymore, not a family on vacation. There are no shuttles to the resort--drive yourself for $10 parking or take a taxi--$15 each way.  2) Candlewood is NOT a suite hotel for Priceline guests. The room, although it has a full kitchen (a good thing) has only one queen bed with no option for more. I ended up sleeping in a LazyBoy!
