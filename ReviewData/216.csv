Building from outside looked like an office building.  They have tried to update this hotel and make it an interior corridor property.  It was a great idea and and looks okay but removing the stucco would make the appearance of the corridors look better.  Either way this did not affect my stay much.   The room could have been a little cleaner.  The night person who checked me in seemed very frustrated to have to assist anyone.  The girl who was working the morning that I checked out was amazing.

All of the rooms are built into the interior of the building, so the windows look into a hallway, not the outdoors.

Mildew on the bathtub, scuffing and gauges in the doors...I get that it was a bargain, but I've learned a lesson to never sacrifice sleeping accommodations to save a few bucks. Not worth it at this location, at all! I'm usually very satisfied with Best Western, and this was my first really, truly awful experience. I will never be back.

Our 2 queen room was large, having a living room and kitchenette which we didn't use. The only negative wasn't part of the hotel, but rather the ART (Anaheim Resort Transit) system. We have used ART many times from other locations and it normally runs every 20 to 30 minutes. However since the Meridian is so far away from the parks, it only runs once an hour. That makes it frustrating knowing that there's no ""next quick"" shuttle. So if you're not using the ART or don't mind the ""one time per hour"" service, I definitely recommend staying here.

An urgent request- to a well-known pest control company- was placed to conduct an inspection (a 3rd party company as mentioned in the guest’s review)  The inspection stated that our rooms are free of any type of insects, and copy of the report was presented to the guest.  As mentioned in the guest review, I’m confident we don’t have this type of issue and that we explained to the guest that we do everything in our ability to protect our property from having such problem brought in. We have daily inspections by our trained housekeeping staff and a bi-weekly service to act as a protective shield from any possible bug infestation that may occur.  Without going into more details about the exact conversation with the guest, I would like to assure you that we take those claims very seriously and because we don’t have anything to hide: the guest was provided with the detailed report; however, he still didn’t accept the fact that our rooms were not the reason behind his rash.

As a member of the hotel’s management team, I would like to clarify the reason that prevented our property from applying any courtesy credit to this guest’s reservation as referenced in this review.  The guest’s original non-refundable reservation for February of 2015 was considered a no-show because the guest didn’t show up due to a family emergency. As a courtesy, we agreed to apply the amount as a credit on the guest’s future stay. Unfortunately, a few weeks later we received a dispute file from our merchant services. The file stated that the guest is in fact disputing the credit card transaction and accusing the property of placing an unauthorized charge on their account.  Due to that action, the guest lost the courtesy credit and was advised that we will continue to hold their reservation; however, they will be responsible for the payment associated with the room cost…. At that point, the guest decided to cancel.     We hope this clarifies our property’s side of the story….. And thank you again for taking the time to read our response.

Our King Wetbar Suites don't contain a stove or a full size refrigerator; therefore, items like utensils are only available upon request for no extra charge.

The rooms themselves weren't horrible, but the air conditioning is loud, the walls are paper thin and the windows face the exterior hallway so you have no privacy. The small pool looked clean, but the other common areas are worn and dirty, definitely not maintained at the standard you'd expect from this chain. Also, when we got to our room, we picked up the phone to call the front desk with a question, but there was no dial tone.

A  fire alarm event happened late in the evening, causing flooding to a room near us. The staff appeared confused and unable to determine the cause, initially. Then, after asking to be moved in order to get away from the noise of the cleanup, we were lied to by the staff as to availability of rooms. The staff finally relented and moved us only after we demanded it.

When the fire alarm went off we did call the fire department and were asked where the fire was or was it a false alarm? We were checking the cameras and also the staff ran through the property. The guest who set the sprinkler off, was trying to conceal/fix the fact that they set it off. Unfortunately by them trying to conceal what they had done the sprinkler system was pumping 600 gallons of water per minute into their 3rd floor room. When the fire department was there they told us that they could not leave the water supply (for the sprinkler system) off over the night. We would have to relocate all 3rd floor guests, our only option was to try and get a licensed sprinkler company to come out to replace and fix the sprinkler system that night. Again, safety is our primary concern, but it took time to get a hold of a licensed tech and get them out there in a very short amount of time. Afterwards we got permission from the Fire Department and were allowed to have guests on the 3rd floor and at that point my staff should have put you in the room you requested which was available, I am sorry to say we Failed, since at that point the safety concerned had been addressed and now customer satisfaction was our priority.

Since we drove here and had free parking passes with our AAA 2-day Disneyland passes, it was actually quite convenient. It's about 2 miles (two or three exits down) away from DL, down the road from the I-5, and a lengthy block down from a shopping center with various chain restaurants.   Pros: The suite itself was very nice for the price ($80 per night average for a King two-room suite, including a small kitchen area, Queen fold-out couch, two flat screens, and a comfortable California King).

There was no noise from other guests but one morning; that may be due to low occupancy or thick walls  The rest of the hotel is older but clean and well kept.  The pool seemed nice but we didn't try it.  Breakfast included waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage, bagels, pastries, cereal, coffee, milk and juice.

The exercise room is limited with one elliptical machine, one tread mill and one universal gym.  Breakfast is included (eggs, sausage, danish, cereal, waffles, fruit, etc.).

The rooms are very large well laid out and both the bedroom and living room area have flat screen plasma tv's! there is a good size fridge much larger than the small minis most hotels have but also note there is no freezer at all in these fridges so youll still need a cooler. no in room microwave but at least there is a comfort station available with a microwave in there as well as vending and washer/dryer. pool is clean and hot tub great as well.

none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best hotel I've been in,"We stayed at the BW Meridian right after they had finished a major remodel.  Everything in the rooms is brand new -- our suite had a kitchen, and two plasma TVs.  The waste-not-want-not mentality means things like: the lights go out when you leave (the light switch uses your card-key).  The soap and shampoo come from stylish dispensers instead of disposable containers, and the bed had something more like a duvet than a true bedspread.  We understand that's because of a desire to always supply clean linens, while the bedspread may not always be cleaned at many other hotels.  The room was impeccably clean and very comfortable.  The staff were friendly and very helpful without being obtrusive.",November 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1394,216

The hotel is very clean, provides a good breakfast and the staff who work there are very friendly and accomodating.  We used the hot tub, which was very nice and our girls liked swimming in the pool; however, I found it a bit on the cool side.  The only down side is the distance from DL. Although the hotel is only a five minute drive it takes 20 minutes on the ARC bus system from the hotel to the park and it only runs once an hour. If you want to be able to go back to your hotel room using the ARC that runs only hourly makes it very difficult.

They have recently remodeled the place and the rooms are really nice. They have implemented many environmentally friendly items such as dispensers for all the hair and body products and the products themselves are environmentally safe.  The location is great also.  We were only a short walk from the Block at Orange which has just about everything you could need.  Since it was winter we did not use the pool, but the it looked nice and there was a lot of space around the pool for relaxing.  The wireless internet worked great.

1 helpful vote,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Positives outweigh negatives,"I compared a lot of hotels and chose the BW Meridian on price and the Best Western reputation.  We normally stay closer to the Anaheim Resort, but the BW was 40% less, which matters if you want to be able to spend $$$ at Disneyland.  As we approached it, I felt the property was too-out-of-the way, but it really wasn't:  it's 10 min away from the park.  The hotel itself is non-descript. I went in to check-in at 2PM, but was told my room wouldn't be ready until three.  The hotel couldn't have been more than 5% full, but was informed they only had 9 deluxe rooms. No problem, just beware if you are looking for early check-in for certain rooms.  We returned at midnight--the keys were ready, no problem.

Check in for a large group can sometimes be hectic, but the staff did a great job, even going the extra mile to allow us to use a meeting room for a pre game discussion.  The rooms were clean and elegant and being a chapparone for the event, I felt very safe watching over our group with the secured doors to enter the hotel.
