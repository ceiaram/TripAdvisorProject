83 helpful votes,174 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Basic Amenities But Functional,"I stayed at the Fullerton Inn for three nights and it served a purpose for this solo travelor.  The venue offered the same amenities as the more expensive inns in the area.  Located between Disneyland and Knotts Berry Farm and priced well under $100.00 per night this venue is a real gem in expensive Orange County. Only negative were room furnishings including the bed were old,dated and well worn. Staff very attentive throughout my stay.  The inn fills the bill for the male solo travelor but a family with children perhaps look around before signing inn.  Also no breakfast provided-coffee each morning in the lobby-worked for me.",April 2019,Large Inn. Ask for room at the rear away from traffic.

The place is a big run down, my room on the first floor was a little better than my friends upstairs room. Theycharge you a $10 deposit for your room key (literally an old school key) & 2 remotes for the TV lol. One remote controls your TV power and other volume/channels which both have duct tape. The room was clean and no weird smells, the AC is ok cold, beds need to be turned or replace though. My bed had an indention so I'd slip into a rut. The restrooms were in good shape, then comes time to sleep. The TV would not shut off so I had to mute it and deal with it being in all night and the upstairs guest stomped around all night and morning.",January 2018,none,Traveled with friends,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,328

16 helpful votes,10 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,No Frills Here,"Comfortable enough for one night.  Our room had 2 queen beds.  Pillows were fat, overstuffed, hard...fine for watching TV but not very nice for sleeping.  Our room had an overhead light that must have had a faulty switch because it flashed on and off for a split second 3 times while we were still awake.  Small refrigerator and microwave.  Closet bar had no hangers for clothes.  Small towels.  Clean.  Restaraunts in the area. Staff seemed pleasant.",April 2016,Try to get room away from the stairs where people come in late with loud voices and heavy feet.,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,328
6 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Comfortable,"It seems like a family owned business so there's no gimmick like the big chains in the area.  The staff was very kind and accommodating which is why I wanted to review this establishment.  Affordable, clean, spacious rooms.  Free wifi and coffee in the morning.  Close to 5 and 91 freeways.  I believe they even allow small pets which is hard to find.  All in all good experience and unlike the reviews below.",February 2013,none,Traveled on business,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,328
4 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Decent place to stay,"I stayed at Fullerton Inn with my 2 daughters last month and found it more than satisfactory.    The furniture was relatively new, the front desk lady was kind, though not the best at english, and we made friends with our neighbors who were all friendly.  Some of them are long-stay guests that live there for weeks at a time.  I think we got more than enough for our money.",July 2008,none,Traveled with family,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,6,328

61 helpful votes,20 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Like a motel from a horror movie!,"Oh My God.  This was our first experience of a Motel in the US and it looked like something out of a bad road movie - you know where the walls are paper thin and someone usually gets murdered.  We thought this was a stereotype but after one long night (Dec 2005) here we thought again.  This motel is convenient to reaching Disney, has free parking and cost about 65US including taxes (very reasonable). BUT the staff don´t speak English or Spanish.  Payment is taken in advance though we were never given a receipt for the credit card transaction - partly because we were told that they weren´t taking the payment until check-out but this was a lie.  There is also a big sign in reception saying ´No Refunds´. Of course after a night of hell we wanted to check out and had the ´no refund´",none,none,none,"I apologize for your horrible experience.
