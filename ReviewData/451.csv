There are a bunch of other hotels, most more upmarket, very near to this one. It's best feature is that it is a little farther from the freeway than most of them, so it's fairly quiet. The rooms have that just-sprayed-with-Raid smell (though it might have nothing to do with Raid and simply reflect the normal odor of an older, lower cost motel), and the paint and wallpaper, especially in the bathroom--are showing their age.

I should have known when I made the reservation, the girl who answered the phone was so hard to understand, (I really don’t understand why a “Hospitality” business would allow an employee with poor communication skills and most the important of the intelligibility of the employee's pronunciation). In spite of this, I made the reservation and showed up to check-in and I was greeted by a women, who must have been having a hectic day because she was short with me and had absolutely no interest in assisting me in anyway.

The woman at the front desk when we checked in was wonderful and very nice but that was about all that was nice about this place.  The first room they gave us stunk so much of air freshener that even opening the window wouldn't clear out the smell so we changed rooms.  That one had been sprayed also but wasn't as bad so we kept it and aired it out by opening the windows and running the fan.  There was nothing special about the room decor and the pictures on the web looked far nicer than the actual room.  The carpeting had stains on it which gave the room a bad feel.

The room was new (refurbished, i guess) and well decorated (not typical small hotel/motel cheap stuff).  The room was a more than adequate size with everything I requested.  It included both a fridge and a microwave.  Perhaps, best of all, the bathroom was very clean and no mildew in the cracks in the tile or around the bathtub.  Breakfast was typical and adequate.

Also, no shampoo, conditioner, etc.  When I went down to the front desk to inquire, I was given shampoo only, and was told they didn't have microwaves by an extremely rude clerk.
