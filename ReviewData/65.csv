The grounds are clean, and the room very modern. The bed was not very comfortable. The springs were a little noisy when moving or getting in/out of bed.

I prefer firm so this did not bother me at all.  2. At times i could hear the person in the next room coughing or talking. I'm not usually bothered by noise but it's a little weird to hear personal noises. Thankfully, nothing private was going on. :) 3. There is not a laundry at this property as I was expecting.

When we arrived there was a booking problem, which likely occurred through the Hilton Website. We had requested a specific ADA accessible Suite, but it wasn't available on our first night. ""Kayla"" who was working the front desk  went to extremes to make sure our needs were met with a different suite. The room we were put in was not technically an ADA accessible room.  However it met our needs.  Beyond that, the hotel is very clean and is either updated or brand new.  It's very close to the Airport, but I never noticed jet's coming in or taking off.

Were this an ""average"" Hampton Inn I would have been happy, but this is one of the cleanest, quietest, and most comfortable Hampton Inns at which I've ever stayed. What makes the hotel particularly nice, however, is how friendly and helpful the front desk staff are.  They make a clear effort to great every guest, to use guest names when they can, to ask how they can help, and to show lots of smiles.  Their friendliness is contagious and I noticed it has a distinct effect on guests who, after interacting with the staff, seem more upbeat and likely to say hi to other guests that they see.

Was pleasantly surprised by the design of the property. I look forward to staying at the property in the future.

Was nice to have a fridge, microwave, food storage, outside sink, and a big bathroom.  Cannot say enough about the staff!!! We were extending our stay in SoCal because of my wife having some medical issues. We checked in and Miguel took it upon himself to make sure all our needs were met and exceeded.
