I had dealt with horrible issue earlier, was filthy and looked like a hobo! At the the end of spring break and beginning of summer Finding some place decent is not easy! Not only did the gentleman accommodate me , but waited till midnight to check me in, and allowed me to leave my car in a check-in parking space for the remainder of the night.

I’d give 5 stars were it not for the ultra-firm mattresses in 207.  Maybe they aren’t in all the rooms.

It was a perfect location with a lot of nearby stores and restaurants to choose from. The Seal Beach Pier is a short walk away.

When we got our bill we noticed they charged us $60 to park. We didn't have a car!!! They did make the adjustment while we were there. California prices are high enough without over charging.

Choosing this small boutique hotel made all the difference in my experience and move it to the outstanding category.  I was able to stay right off of PCH, withing a few blocks of the beach, and the town of Seal Beach, for the same price I had paid for a chain hotel close to 405. This allowed me to navigate to all of my favorite places and avoid having to deal with freeway traffic, as well as having the convenience of walk-ability to many food and beverage options.

We would like to express our sincerest apologies for the issues you encountered during your stay here with us. Our Park & Cruise package is one of our most highly booked packages and it is extremely out of character that an issue like this arose. We do indeed have one shuttle that fits a total of 8 passengers along with limited space for suitcases. It is a 30 min drive from the hotel and it runs hourly, depending on traffic it may take a little longer to get inside the cruise terminal - which comes with a designated parking area. In any case that the shuttle is full or behind your desired schedule we do offer Uber or Lyft rides at our expense. We’ll be increasing our efforts when it comes to our shuttle schedule and front desk to guest communication so that this situation won’t repeat itself. I can promise you that the highest quality standards will be met moving forward.

When I entered the room, there was a weird smell, you know, the one of too much odor remover over the years. - the breakfast: the breakfast room is small and the choice is limited for hotels in that price range  - The pool is small and it is, due to the construction of the hotel, hard to get some sun around it - We booked via a business travel agency, who should have paid the stay in",October 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,536,37

I would say the room itself was very comfortable with nice bathroom, good space, and comfortable bed. The view from the room was just of the street and a bit disappointing. Front desk staff was very friendly; free parking was a perk. The breakfast was hot and cold options - like sausage, mini omelets, fruit, bagels, etc. It was decent as far as free breakfasts go. The pool looked a little sad - nothing like the photo. The location was good if you want to be next to the restaurants in Seal Beach. The beach was only like a 10 minute walk from the hotel.

We have been visiting Seal Beach for about 7 years now. We actually found Seal Beach and the Pacific Inn by accident years ago. Let's just start by saying the hotel is amazing. It is walking distance to pretty much everything you need. The staff is incredibly helpful and courteous. The breakfast they do every morning is by far one of the best you can get comparing it to a lot of the hotels around.

In order to keep our property updated and functional for our guests, we have been undergoing both lobby and room renovations in the recent months. Our lobby renovations have nearly concluded, and our new modern look has been a hit with our guests. Based on previous room blocks, bookings, and requests, we may randomly upgrade reservations the day of arrival in order to utilize our inventory as efficiently as possible. We initially placed your parties as near to each other as possible for your convenience; due to this, one of the rooms happened to be an upgraded room type, our Executive King. Upgrades do not happen solely based on our occupancy, and is most often a random process. In addition, your party was informed of their complimentary upgrade upon check-in. In order to guarantee an upgraded room, it is essential to book the desired room type at the upgraded rate, as complimentary upgrades are random. However, for the convenience of your entire party we were able to move you into an upgraded room free of charge as well. We appreciate your feedback on our breakfast selection, and would like to note that our paper products are eco-friendly and recyclable. As for your charges, we do take the full payment upon check-in, where your party was informed of the total stay charge. The difference you are seeing in room rate versus final charge is simply state and tourism taxes, which we list on your registration card upon check-in as well as your online confirmation.

It is a neat little hotel in a great location.  However, their room rates have been escalating out of sync with other hotels in the area.  Yes, they have added a warm breakfast, but it leaves something to be desired and definitely isn't worth the cost that's been added to the room. The carpet was frayed in our room and there was grit left on the bathroom floor.  For the price we paid on our last trip, we would expect a 5 star experience.

We take our customers’ problems seriously and are glad to hear from you. First of all we would like to thank you for choosing to stay at The Pacific Inn for your lodging accommodations for a second time and we are sorry to hear that you had another unpleasant stay.   Our property is an older building and was established 27 years ago and has been The Pacific Inn for about 10 years now. During this time we have done extensive renovations and updates to your rooms to ensure that we are providing the best services possible for our customers. Since we are an older building we do strive to always maintain and update the property. In your comment you mentioned that in your room the carpets were dirty and had mold in the shower and again I do apologize because that is not the standards we have. We do hire professional carpet cleaners as well as re-grout our showers every year to ensure that problems like these do not arise.  Please e-mail us back with the room you stayed in so we can make sure to address these problems. Since our pool is in the middle of our hotel I completely understand how it can get noisy especially if there are a lot of people going in and out of the pool. This is one of the reasons we have set hours where people can use our pool (between 6am and 10pm). We do have a bellman that monitors this as well as picks up the pool area but since he has many other jobs, he checks and cleans the pool periodically which is why you may have seen it a bit unkempt at that moment.  Again, thanks for taking the time to let us know how you feel.

When you called to inform us that there was not additional room for you on the shuttle, another van was immediately sent and you were pick around 10am, only 30 minutes after your ""reserved"" pick up time. This clarification of the actual events that occurred is not meant to discredit that there was a delay in you pick up, but to reveal your actual wait time which has been greatly exaggerated. I understand that any wait time is inconvenient and I am sorry that you had to wait for an additional half hour while other guests at the hotel were utilizing the Free shuttle van. We have created time specific logs to ensure that an issue like this does not arise in the future and appreciate you bringing this problem to the managements attention so it can be fixed.

Traveling as a family this was the perfect place to stay before embarking on our cruise to Mexico.  True it is a little dated and worn in the lobby & common areas - the rooms have been re-done and were clean & comfortable.  Quick and safe walk to the beach just 5 minutes away & a McDonalds located across the street ~ It doesn't get much better for families.       They also offer shuttle service (free) to the Long Beach Pier and we were able to save the cost of parking at the pier (which runs $15 a day) Shuttle drives were great and we only had a short wait on our return.

It was pretty affordable and surprisingly nice for the price.  The rooms are pretty spacious and have a little balcony off them.

The hotel is situated in a lovely location within walking distance of eateries/shops/beach.  The staff were very helpful.  The room clean and refreshed on a daily basis.  The complimentary breakfast adequate. (I use the word adequate only because I like a good fry up on holiday). The Pool looked inviting but on this trip i did not manage a dip.  The complimentary shuttle was used by my mother to attend church and she was impressed by the service. The free wifi was easily accessible/speedy and a bonus.

The front of the hotel and the hall would need a serious renovation.  The rooms are much better than expected.  They are spacious and bathroom was great with a nice big shower, nice little terrace.

This is THE ONLY  place walking distance to down town Seal so it gets pretty full on weekends so book ahead. They offer a locals discount  so ask if u call  for reservations. They recently painted the hallways.!!  Before they had a horrid gold color that I used to complain about everytime I was here.. They finally heard me. Now it's a lovely warm 2 tone brown. Rooms are always clean and all have a nice balcony. and free wifi!!

We have family there and have previously rented houses when we've gone to visit.  From now on we will stay at the Pacific Inn.  All of the staff are pleasant and helpful.  The dead bolt on our door didn't work and a hook in the bathroom was loose.  We advised the front desk and the maintenance man immediately took care of everything.  Cleanliness is my No. 1 concern and the Pacific Inn surpassed my high standards.  Every part of the hotel is clean and neat.  The housekeeping staff do an outstanding job.

Seal Beach and in particular The Pacific Inn, will become a favorite.  The property is very well located with just a short walk to a variety of shops and the beach.

You can eat outside over looking the pool if you so choose.  Parking is free and convenient to the rooms.

Everything is within walking distance, which makes using a car obsolete (rare in So Cal).  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  This isn't the kind of place I would want to spend too much time in only because the pool is small and surrounded by the building and the views are of the local neighborhood.  It was just the perfect place to shower and sleep.  Our toliet didn't flush properly when we arrived and we had to wait about an hour to get service to repair it.
