51 helpful votes,63 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Decent homestay-type hotel near Disneyland,"Cons: 1. Rooms are bit aged. The AC is quite noisy at times, perhaps due to its throttling to match the pre-set temperature. Cupboards were bit worn also. 2. No free shuttle to Disneyland. Like all hotels in that area, its a short 20min walk to Disneyland anyway.  3. Only 1 lift available to use. Was rather busy especially during this Thanksgiving holiday week 4. Parking was USD15/day (sheltered garage type) 5. As compared to other similar types of lodging, the gym was rather sparse with only a couple of stationary bicycles & threadmill, and dumbbells. What i dislike is that there were no windows whatsoever. It looks too enclosed, and somewhat ‘dirty’.  Pros: 1. Despite being near the freeway, the room had good sound insulation. 2.

We went to Disneyland as a family of four, and I found Candlewood suites to be just what we needed. The bathroom was very clean and well laid out, and the little kitchenette was helpful. Only thing is that double beds are tiny when 2 kids plus 2 adults are sharing. Plus there was no daily servicing of the room (just a clean bathmat provided each day) so the room got a bit messy.   We didn’t use the pool but the laundry room was helpful.   I liked Candlewood, but now that I’ve been to Anaheim, we really didn’t walk around much. We caught Ubers.

Parking space is limited in general at all the hotels in the Disneyland area due to space and that includes us.

We do our best to manage that and on occasion, hire a tow truck to remove the cars.  Often times, we use a valet service company to manage the extra cars free of charge to the guest.  This particular weekend, we were  nowhere near being sold out but unfortunately, for reasons I stated above, we ran out of parking spaces which is why the agent did not charge you for the parking.

We booked directly through the hotel (always recommended!) using a AAA discount and a 1-bedroom suite was just under $100 per night.

But there must be some confusion in regards to what you had encountered at my property.  First, we charge $17.55 for parking, not $30. That is one of the lowest parking charges in the Disneyland area. Most hotels charge around $24 per day. Secondly, ALL parking garages whether they charge or not have that same disclaimer in their parking areas stating ""Park At Your Risk"".  It's to protect the guest and the hotel by keeping you informed and ensuring guests do their part to protect their belongings and their car.  We are in a tourist destination area with a lot of people so our local police department recommends everyone do they part to keep the area safe and deter improper activities.  We take that very seriously at our hotel.  And your last comment is the most confusing which is that you did not receive a King Bed room. That would be very difficult to do because we do not have ANY king bed rooms in the whole hotel and we don't advertise that we have king bed rooms in the hotel on any of the booking channels. The largest bed we offer at all is a suite with a queen.   If you would like to discuss this any further, please feel free to call the hotel and ask to speak with me directly.

The walk is normally 15-20 minutes long which is what is listed on Google Maps, what other guests had mentioned to us and what we have experienced when we have walked to Disneyland.  Certainly, depending on each individual, it can vary.  We always suggests to our guests who have small children to take the ART Shuttle which has a nominal fee for all day use.  We understand that it can be somewhat tiring when pushing a stroller.  In regards to room type you received, I am unable to check and verify what type of room you were booked on without a full name.  If you would like to share that info, I can certainly look it up.  But often times, we do UPGRADE our guests into the 1 bedroom suite when available because it has a separate bedroom from the living room area.  Our 2 bed room is a studio suite with 2 double beds which is half the size of the 1 bedroom suite.  We hope this will not deter you from choosing to stay with us again.

Bed was comfortable and I made use of the coffee and popcorn that was provided.  I was on the top floor which was good but my room was near the end of the corridor - which was quite far from the elevator (which did require some wait at times as there was only one elevator at reception).  If you have any mobility problems I would recommend requesting a room nearer the elevator.  The walls were quite thin and I found it was quite noisy at times with children screaming and running about in the corridor, but I did appreciate that the hotel had signs up to request quiet time - which I think was around 10pm-7am.

Yes, I did realize this was near Disneyland and was marketed as such so I knew that going in. My room was surrounded by many rooms with families and very small children. At one point all three rooms in our little section of the hallway had at least one child screaming and crying. Luckily, once you moved way from the door/walls you couldn't hear it as much but that was still distracting. And yes again, I know that wasn't unreasonable but after a long day, it could still get irritating.

There was part of a straw wrapper on the floor in the kitchen area. There were dirt/crumbs in the bedroom dresser. And my son's and my allergies went a little crazy when we were in the room.

Having a kitchen, it's a plus so you can save some money on food. The room was big and has a huge desk. I was so happy to do laundry for free (of course, bring your own detergent). There was a night I noticed the water in the shower was not hot at all and that is indispensable for me. I tried to call the front desk but they never picked up my room calls. The next day, I personally went to tell them about my concern and the guy told me it was an issue in the whole hotel. He apologized and explained me they were working on it. Thank God when I came back from the parks it was fixed. Also, if you are looking for a family pool I will suggest you check",February 2017,none,none,Dear PetiteGrace!

13 helpful votes,4 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Not quite what I expected.,"The room is a great size.  It's wonderful to have a kitchen.  The beds are super comfortable!   BUT after a long day at Disneyland if you want to soak in a hot tub, forget it.  You get a cold pool.  Not a big deal.  But if you want a hot, or even warm shower, you might not get that either.  We didn't have hot water for a while.  And speaking of water, I just think a nice hotel like this ought to have filtered drinking water available for guests without charging $2 for Dasani.  Also the elevator doors could be more clearly marked.  There are 2.  One leads to the parking garage and the other to the hotel lobby.  They both say 'lobby'.  A little confusing til you get your bearings.   Other than that it was a very comfortable stay.",February 2017,none,none,"Hello Stephanie o,  Thank you for staying with us and for leaving a short review. I am delighted that you found our beds comfortable and that you liked the rooms. However, it is regrettable that the elevator and the hotel's lack of hot tub affected your overall satisfaction.

13 helpful votes,39 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location,The hotel is so close to Disneyland and reasonably priced. We had a kitchenette which helped a lot with eating in and cooking for the kids. The theme park dining options are expensive so this was a great plus. We were rained out of the park so we had to stay in. There were delivery options when we didn't want to cook. They have DVD players on loan with a decent movie selection. This came in very handy since their cable selections weren't very kid/family oriented. The housekeepers and maintenance we encountered were all very friendly.,February 2017,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,562,5

Heater making loud clicking sounds. Upstairs neighbors jumping up and down starting around 11:30pm.

We arrived early on our day of check in, but were able to be given our room immediately at 10am. The check in process was very simple and stress free.

I am usually a light sleeper so it was nice. The beds were nice and comfy. The staff was always so nice. We ended up walking to Disneyland the first day. Took maybe about 15 minutes to walk there. There is a bus that you can ride over to Disneyland that stops right outside the hotel on the street. And to come back they drop you right off at the same spot and they do come throughout the day I believe. Coming back from Disneyland it was bus #6 and for 2 adults and 1 child it was like $7.00 I think it was for one way.
