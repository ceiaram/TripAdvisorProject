And, if you feel like it, it is only 1 mile to walk to the Main Gate down Harbor Blvd.  The Resort Amenities are not bad.

They showed us a model of ""new"" 5 star resort which was located in Anaheim.  They told us in was in the back lot of disney near frontierland. They didnt realize that I worked for disney. I told them there was no 5 star resort anywhere in Anaheim and definately not in the backlot of disney.  Their whole attitude changed and they became very rude. They abruptly finished thier presentation, gave us the gift certificates, and ushered us out. We looked up dophins Cove when we returned home and it is nothing but a refurbished apartment complex in a very bad area of town, not at all the 5 star resort that they tried to sell us.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,465,284

When resorts in Anaheim state they're within a couple ""blocks"" within Disneyland, note the term ""blocks"" are used EXTREMELY loosely and that DC is actually more like a good mile and a half from the main park entrance. Furthermore, the resort itslef is located on the very fringe of the main hotel strip and we spotted many criminal activites taking place on Orangewood Ave. outside the resort. Also, the walls on the units are paper thin, as to not block the loud outside noise at all. We did not encounter any ants during our stay, but our unit heater shorted out, causing our room to fill with smoke at 4:00am and we had sewage backing up in our sinks as we were checking out.

We've stayed at some nice hotels in LV (Luxor) and LA (Doubletree) before coming over to Dolphin's Cove, but the other hotels do not offer a memorable stay. In Dolphin's Cove (DC), they have a Kid's Cove whereby they organise activities for kids while mom and dad can relax in the heated pool.  The one-bedroom is very clean and neat...still bearing the smell of fresh paint! The layout of the room is very well thought out and it feels like we are actually staying at a service apartment. The fully-equipped kitchen is really a plus point especially when you wanna do you own cooking for a change.

The resort had a kids movie night which my son loved. The two biggest problems I had were: there is only one heater/air-conditioner in the 1 bedroom unit and it is in the living room. It was also very, very loud. The other is the ants. My son ran out of the bathroom saying that there were ants everywhere. I went in expecting one or two ants only to find 50 - 100 ants marching in the sink and on the countertop.  The resort must know about the problem because there was a can of ant spray under the kitchen cabinet. Spraying kept them away that night but the next morning they were back and I had to spray again.

The rooms were comfortable enough, and the grounds were okay, but after the hype of what it would be, I was letdown to say the least. The pool was nice, but the complimentary breakfast was skimpy and of poor quality. The children's playground was a small swingset.  There were ants in the bathroom. There's a coffee-maker in the apartment, but you have to pay a buck for any coffee packet after the first one. There is no housekeeping done beyond a change of towels. The parking stalls were dismal.

We have stayed at other Fairfield resorts and have always been pleased. We had this reservation since last October and were a bit concerned by some of the previous negative feedback regarding the resort. Although I was pleased that the renovations had been completed and the room sizes were quite large, our two bedroom unit only had one small wall air conditioner in the living area and it had been turned off prior to our arrival.
