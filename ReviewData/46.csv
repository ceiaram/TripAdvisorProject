If you're looking for the Ritz-Carlton, this is not the place you should be, but one thing any 5* property can't replicate is charm and this place sure does have it, in my opinion.....",June 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,156,46

We have in the past provided iPod compatible clock radios property wide and some premium rooms still have them. The issue is we soon found is that not only did docking ports become outdated quickly the radios themselves seemed to disappear at a steady pace.

Please keep in mind we have 42 rooms and a beach house and they are all different. If you book the same room that you see online it will be much the same when you check in. The only difference is some rooms may show carpet online and have since been upgraded to wood flooring.  While illegal parking on our property is quite rare when it does occur, as noted by the posted signs, we tow the trespasser to make room for our guests. We apologize if your stay was interrupted by such activity.  You are correct not all rooms have A/C and this is called out on our website on a room by room basis. However the portable units do a good job when needed. Being a classic 1940's Laguna Beach destination the electrical service provided by the power company unfortunately is not robust enough to support A/C in every room. The Rivieras recent upgrades to LED's property wide and other conservation measure may allow us to add more A/Cs in the near future as we reduce power consumption.  I'm sorry that the complimentary continental breakfast was not to your liking. We have the pastries baked fresh every morning, coffee & tea, juices, cereals, fruit, hot/cold as well as fresh cooked waffles to choose from.

Coffee is available in all rooms to be used at anytime you wish 24 hrs a day, or in the office during operating hours of 8:00 am to midnight. Should you wish a traditional sit-down breakfast there are several excellent choices within a one to two minute walk from the property. Even though our license does not allow a full service restaurant we are happy to recommend one of the many located nearby.

I have never in my life seen such horrible front desk service at any hotel, let alone a pricey beach resort.  I was here as an invited speaker for UC Irvine. I was told the university would be billed directly. The front desk clerk, a young dark-haired woman wearing a silver headband, looked up my name and snarled--and I mean SNARLED--that they would need payment to check me in. My host came to the front desk, and she told him that her boss said they needed to pay for the room in advance.

Unfortunately they did not have a deposit on the reservation and refused to provide a credit card upon arrival to secure the room. We must have a form of payment and ID on file to check anyone in.  Once I intervened this guest agreed to provide a card to secure the room. Ultimately they contacted their sponsor who should have already arranged payment, but had not, and the entire payment issue was resolved. I do understand and saw that this guest was agitated and embarrassed by the incident being there with colleagues and not having had everything properly planned for in advance of their arrival.  While I appreciate the situation we simply can not check anyone in without securing payment first.   Many rooms but not all have air conditioning and this is clearly called out on our website and when booking reservations. As for the kids asking for keys, that was an unfortunate situation and upon final review they were at the hotel with their parents. Unfortunately we have local kids come to the desk on a regular basis with all kinds of stories to secure room keys to allow them access to the swimming pool. So you can appreciate we cannot simply hand out room keys to every child who asks without any identification.  The law also requires that unless we personally know someone we must verify the guests identiy before issuing replacement room keys. This is for the safety and security of our guests.

We had four of us staying (two adults with our two grown children), and I had carefully picked room 403 to face the ocean and accommodate all of us. When we arrived, we were told they had moved us to 401. When I asked why the move, the person at the desk told me it was an upgrade, and that we would also be getting a discount. After viewing the room, it was clear that it was not an upgrade -- it was a smaller room with a pull out sofa rather than a murphy bed.

Our 1932 beach bungalow is truly an authentic Laguna Beach experience and there is more than enough space for your group of 4. It will comfortably sleep 6 with its' 3 bedrooms and the views are truly amazing.  Your comment about the pool is interesting. I agree, that it would be better positioned by contemporary standards if it overlooked the ocean.   As a bit of history, when the hotel was opened back in 1948 it was a luxury to have a pool so many properties including the Laguna Riviera if they had this luxury would put their pool in a location that allowed passersby to know immediately that feature was available. It was advertising at its' best and worked quite well for its' time.   The indoor sauna, jacuzzi and pool are used frequently all year round and the roof is open most of the time bringing in fresh air and sun. Since we use a salt water system there are no harsh chemicals or chlorine smell to deal with. It is really quite comfortable and relaxing, and while you can't watch the surfers while you relax you can see a parade of exotic cars pass by all day long and the wall and steamed up glass offers sufficient privacy from passersby. Adjacent to the pool is a game room with foos ball, air hockey, and ping pong which the kids enjoy as they bounce between swimming and playing games.

If anyone ever has an issue you can always get a strong signal in the lobby or use our complimentary hardwired computer kiosk.   The free shuttles in the summer are a fantastic way to get around, see the city, avoid the traffic, and daunting task of finding parking. Some people will just hop on at the stop right in front of the Laguna Riviera an ride a full round trip just to relax, people watch, and enjoy a free tour of the city.  Thanks again and we look forward to seeing you and the family next year.  Happy travels,  -Kort",none,none,none,none,none,none,257,46

We live in Southern California and Laguna Beach is one of my favorite beach towns.  Everything is within walking distance and it has such a great vibe.  Laguna Riviera is right in the heart of everything and it is on a nice beach.  I think for the price, you cannot do much better.  We stayed in room 505 and it was very large.  We had a full kitchen as well as a bedroom with a queen bed and a queen murphy bed in the living room.  They gave us a crib to use for our toddler.  The beds were really comfortable.

I am glad to hear that room 505 met your needs and you found the new ventilated memory foam mattresses comfortable. We have received several requests on where to buy them which is always a good sign.  The rooms at the Laguna Riviera on average are quite large. Your room not including the deck space is almost 900 square feet and the average for rooms on the 5th level is 400 square feet. A recent report by a leading hotel analysis company reported that hotel rooms in the U.S. average 170 square feet while our smallest room is 212 sq ft and we average about 400 sq ft per room not including deck or patio area. A portion of deck space is reserved exclusively for this room but we have not partitioned them yet so it is open to the neighbors. We have found many times friends will rent adjoining rooms and appreciate having the space connected, but also know that others would prefer to have it be more private, so we are looking into portable or curtain partitions so that it can easily convert to accommodate both needs.  Your observations regarding location and price are what make the Laguna Riviera stand out when compared to many properties. Our price for what you get is the best value in town with no hidden charges for parking, internet, or a resort fee and on top of it you get free continental breakfast, beach chairs and umbrellas. The location is on arguably the best beach in town and close enough to downtown to walk but just far enough away to not have all the activity out your front door.   I will discuss your comment regarding explanations of services upon check in. The desk staff has a list of key point to share with all new guests and I suspect they may have been busy and skipped that part. Rest assured that if you ask the desk staff about any events in town, where to eat or how to get there you will receive prompt and courteous assistance.  Summer time is family time at the Laguna Riviera and has been our hallmark for decades. We find that once school is back in session everything quiets own and the couples and more mature guests come and enjoy the amazing fall and spring seasons with us and some even make the Laguna Riviera home for the winter occupying one of our full kitchen units for 2-3 months at a time.  We look forward to your next visit and thank you for choosing the Laguna Riviera.   Happy travels,  -Kort",none,none,none,none,none,none,258,46

We are so glad to hear you had a wonderful time and enjoyed the property and town. The new patios at 101 were a result of city requirements as we rebuilt the slope. What I do like is it opens the view from inside the room since it is now a terraced space. Architecturally it  aligns with the railing systems used throughout the property. In place of the wood used in prior years we upgraded to far superior aluminum. It does slightly obscure the view but the trade off is it allows the breeze to pass through making for a much more comfortable space in the summer.  I actually have a guest who used to call the old glass enclosed deck a solar oven because he could only spend a short time on it before going to the pathway to cool off.   Like you, we all miss the tree and tried to relocate it during construction but, unfortunately it did not survive. We have planted the areas on the north and south sides of the patios and when complete the patios will be far more private and hidden behind the greenery and out of view from the pathway and adjacent house. We believe this will make for a very cozy and beautiful space.  Thanks again and we look forward to your next stay with us.  Happy travels,  -Kort",none,none,none,none,none,none,264,46

Your observations will be useful to travelers as they consider ocean front properties and things to do in Laguna.   As you touched on the Laguna Riviera has many different rooms from large suites with full size kitchen, living room, bedroom, dining room and private deck to cozy studios with semi-private decks with spectacular views. Our average room is over 400 square feet.  We have an online grid to help those new to the property make their selection and our knowledgeable desk staff is always ready to assist.  The construction noise is diminishing and many times non-existent as we start to approach the completion of the new retaining walls, stairs and patios for our 3 bedroom ocean front beach bungalow. Once completed it will be spectacular for family gatherings, small weddings and corporate events. You will even have private access to the beach from the lower patio. As always is the case in construction it has taken quite a bit longer than anticipated but we hope to see completion before summer is in full swing. Also note that there is no construction allowed on the weekends.  The Rivieras location is arguably the best in town close to everything yet just far enough away for some quiet solitude. The best surfing in town is at our doorstep and so many great restaurants are within walking distance that you could stay for two weeks and never eat at the same one twice.   For nightlife there is the Marine Room as mentioned, and I would also recommend the White House as it is also in the downtown area and caters to a similar crowd. The Sandpiper mentioned (known to locals as The Dirty Bird) is just south of us, a lot of fun, with a bit more rowdy of a crowd. For the best sound system and often times world class musicians (think Macy Gray, English Beat, and project groups formed by members of major touring bands) I like to recommend Mozambique. They are less than a mile walk south and if you are a guest of the Laguna Riviera free transportation is offered to and from their restaurant and music lounge. If you are looking for Sunday Reggae without the pretense I know you will enjoy Mozambique's service and atmosphere.   Thanks again & Happy Travels,  -Kort",none,none,none,none,none,none,274,46

Exactly how it was depicted in the pictures on the website. HOWEVER what wasn't made clear when we booked was the extensive site reconstruction work - effectively the lower half of the resort was a building site. Balconies were very dusty and the noise of machinery did not go down well when trying to sunbathe. The duty manager acknowledged this and offered to clean our balcony. He then offered us an alternative room - the first we rejected but took the second one. We took the second option 'the suite' which was dated and adequate at best. It certainly needs some TLC. Overall not a holiday experience we would want to repeat.,October 2012,none,none,"I agree that everyone needs to be informed, and am sorry this guest was dissapointed by our slope renovation. We have done everything we can to well publicize the repair work. It has been underway since the beginning of the year.   After 7-1/2 years of engineering, design and challenging city roadblocks we finally received permission to stabilize the front slope and protect the hotels buildings. We have been very active making this known to all. If you book online you must acknowledge that you have read the construction notice prior to booking. The front page of our website states very simply and clearly that the slope is under construction, even on TripAdvisor we have a notice that we are under repair with a detailed description available, and when you call to book, the front office makes sure to deliver the message.   Fortunately we are very close to completion and once done a new pathway and landscaping will be installed. Until that happens guests must reach the beach by using the public access adjacent to the property. From many rooms it is the same or a shorter distance and in no case does it increase the walk by more than a minute.  Yes the pathway to the beach is a great convenience and we regret that these repairs became necessary to keep the property safe, but the side access serves guest well to reach the sand. The pathway will soon be reopened and when it is, updates will be posted on our website.   Once the repairs are completed we hope you will give us another try and perhaps an updated review.

Occasionial visitors like us were treated to a room facing a noisy thoroughfare. Since the room had no airconditioning (an unrevealed surprise when we made the reservation), the noise was unbearable, because of the open windows. The beach is literally five floors below the hotel and accesssible only by climbing a narrow, open staircase. Good for exercise but a pain for those who carry blankets, towels, bags, etc. to the beach.

The so-called "" free continental breakfast'' contains about $1.50",August 2012,none,none,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience while staying with us, and like you,  I also encourage readers to peruse all reviews, explore our website, and call with any questions to make the most informed decision possible. Thank you for complimenting our very nice rooms and location.  I'm sorry that our ocean front location does not provide an elevator to the beach, but unfortunately, that was not a viable option when the property was built in 1948, and today we could never get a retrofit approved by the city. Fortunately it is an easier walk than staying across the street or at one of the many properties in town that are not actually on the ocean.  While our beach pathway is closed for renovations (expected to reopen soon) you do need to use the adjacent public stairs down to the sand. All in all it takes 2-3 minutes.  Yes you are correct we are very busy in the Summer with many families returning year after year and often selling out a year in advance. Anyone traveling to Laguna Beach on short notice in the summer will likely not have access to the preferred rooms unless there is a cancellation.   The worn exterior hallway carpets mentioned are schedule for replacement after the summer season closes. They do get a lot of abuse being outside and on the ocean and it is unfortunate that they impacted your stay with us.  The configuration of all of our rooms, including if they have A/C or not, is clearly called out on our website, and for those without A/C who do not get enough relief from the cool ocean breeze we offer portable A/C units like the one you mentioned that you were offered.  Our FREE Continental breakfast is dictated by the health department to be individually wrapped which could cause one to believe it is junk food. It is not. The pastries are prepared fresh and delivered daily, the fresh fruit usually consisting of bananas, apples and oranges are straight from the farm, we also provide name brand cereals both hot and cold, along with coffee, an assortment of teas, several fruit juices and milk. We may be expanding this offering in the future pending approvals to upgrade our food service permits and install an approved kitchen. The continental breakfast is complimentary and a nice way to get started in the morning. If one needs a more robust breakfast there are several great options within a 1-2 minute walk of the hotel, or you can have the folks next door deliver to your room.  You can certainly find less expensive accommodations in Laguna Beach but not on the ocean. If price is your main concern I encourage anyone to check rates on the North end of town at the properties inland of Coast Highway. If your desire is to stay ocean front with direct beach access, then we offer the best value in town. Unlike many ocean front properties, we do not charge for parking, internet, continental breakfast, beach chairs & umbrellas, and the new resort fee showing up everywhere. If price is not an issue I encourage anyone to look at the Montage, a truly amazing property or the Surf & Sand, both just to the south of us.  You are right, we are a family friendly hotel and because of that we have many loyal return guests every year. If one is looking for a quiet romantic retreat without the presence of family activities, please consider the off season when kids are back in school and both the hotel and town are much quieter.

I apologize in advance for the lengthy review, but so much is wrong with this last stay I feel it should be noted. Let’s start off with the “Ugly” and move on to the Bad and Good. THIS HOTEL IS UNDER MAJOR CONSTRUCTION! Yes, when I say major I mean a major feature of the hotel is not available and that is the beach access. You see, one of the nice things about this hotel was that it had (notice I said HAD) a gently sloping switchback (with no stairs) in the back of the hotel with direct access to Laguna Beach. This switchback allows anyone with small children or physically challenged people to",June 2012,none,none,"Thanks for sharing your impressions of the hotel project, and let me take a few moments to clarify what is going on.  Yes after 7-1/2 years of design and city applications finally approval has been granted to repair the landslide suffered on the ocean side of the property.   This fact is highly visible on the front page of our website and has been all year, along with pictures that are updated regularly to offer a clear idea of the scope and location of the project. During this repair the pathway to the beach is closed and beach access is out the side of the property and down the public stairs. The side access is actually the shortest route to the beach but is not as scenic and does involve stairs, rather than a pathway with switchbacks. This is all a short term inconvenience to create a long term solution to a major issue. While we expected completion by June the circumstance of the local geology combined with a very complex build has unfortunately extended our deadline until after summer.  There is printed notice of the work and new beach access clearly and predominately posted on our website, at the check in desk, it is given when reservations are made, plus there is signage on the pathway and all of this has been in place since we began at the beginning of this year.  The construction is isolated to the slope and is not a property wide major project. With this said you may hear some of the equipment from time to time or an infrequent jack hammer if an unforeseen boulder is unearthed, but fortunately on the hotel side it looks like most of the digging is complete and we are now in the final stages. We will be back-filling dirt and gravel as the final block walls are stacked and the pathway is restored to its original location with new railings and lighting to improve safety.  I'm sorry to learn that neighboring guests gathering on the public deck disrupted your stay. And, should note that it cannot even accommodate 100's of people. It has two tables and in it's entirety is suitable for 15-20 max. However, in situations like this, we are more than happy to intervene and quiet things down so that everyone has a restful and enjoyable stay. Please call the office and we will take care of it.  With regards to the parking we have parking for every room. If one cannot locate parking just talk to the desk and you will be accommodated. If employees or contracted workers are taking any spaces they will be asked to move immediately as they are already not allowed to park onsite. If this still fails to produce a parking spot we will pay for your parking meter.  While I am sorry and concerned that this guest fell down I must assure all readers that there is no construction debris in any guest accessible area. It is all behind blockades or areas clearly marked ""No Trespassing"". The only impact that the construction has caused us is a light dust that floats up towards some of the directly ocean facing areas when we have an onshore breeze. This, housekeeping stays on top of and the work crew is constantly watering down the actual construction site to keep this light dust to a minimum.  I took a look at the nice video link with the great ocean view shared by this guest and you can hear a jackhammer at work. This activity was short lived to clear a boulder and is not something that is ongoing.  We know that such work can be disruptive and very clear information has been posted on our website all year offering complete disclosure for all to read. Please feel free to visit and see as things progress, and be notified when everything has been repaired, and the pathway returned to its original location and rebuilt to a safe standard that stabilizes not only the slope but the entire hotel.  Thank you for sharing your photos and I encourage everyone who is interested in seeing more to visit our website lagunariviera.com and monitor the weekly progress.

We appreciate yours, and everyone's, patience while we complete the rebuilding of the ocean slope stabilizing it and upgrading the ocean pathway. The work is taking longer than originally planned due to the geology and very tight building location but when complete it will be a beautiful upgrade to both the hotel and the house providing years of functionality and customer enjoyment.

The view and sounds of ocean day and night were awesome in the surf view room.  The ocean view rooms do have ocean views and sounds of ocean during the day, but when doors are closed and locked at night you can't hear the ocean. So if hearing the ocean at night is important you will have to pay for surf view. The main grilling area with chairs and tables is really nice so no matter which room you have, you can grill and hang out ocean front. We grilled 3 of the 4 nights we stayed and loved eating dinner and watching the sunset. We even saw dolphins 2 of the nights.

The views and, of course, the town is what brings our guests to Laguna Beach and the Laguna Riviera year after year.   Your room, 508 is one of our most popular rooms for couples because of the privacy and it has, arguably, the best view on the property. The bed is a fold out, or more accurately a Murphy bed. It is like any other regular bed, except that it retracts into the wall to create more space during the day. It uses a regular queen mattress that is of the same quality as any top end hotel mattress.

We strive for a very high level of customer services and while we receive many compliments on his performance your experience will be discussed with him to make sure everyone receives the same high level of attention.  It is unfortunate that your view was disturbed by wind swept debris. Unfortunately we find it necessary to clean the lower roofs from time to time to clear the stray champagne cork, paper, leaves and other debris that can blow off of the upper decks and in from the surrounding area.  Like many hotels several of the private decks are separated by walls and latices. These are not designed to block the guest from all potential noise but rather to lend some privacy from view. Having just returned from a vacation in Hawaii staying at a 5 star hotel, I experienced the same issue with my neighbor. He was constantly on the cellphone and while annoying, I distracted myself with the ocean view and conversation with my wife. Since the rooms and decks share a common wall I understand complete isolation is not possible.  When staying at the Laguna Riviera, if your goal is to have a quiet room as far away from other guests, and the public areas, please let us know and we will accommodate as best we can with what is available. Rooms like 406 can be very quiet save for the sound of the crashing waves.  While I understand this guests concerns about the potential of noisy neighbors and what they could do and what might happen, it appears that none of it actually did happen, and they slept quite well.  We find that our guests are generally considerate of others, but should such a thing happen, and anyone is bothered by noisy guests please contact the office so the issue can be addressed. While certainly not a common occurrence, families on vacation can sometimes stay up later than usual visiting and sitting outdoors in the warm evening air. We understand this, and our staff is always available and happy to intervene asking guests to quiet down and be respectful of others.   Being right on the ocean the Laguna Riviera, like many of the other ocean front hotels in town is constantly maintaining and servicing the property to stay ahead of the harsh salt air and coastal winds.

With rooms completely remolded in 2009 and more upgrades scheduled to complete before the Summer of 2012, then add on free parking, free internet, free beach equipment use, free continental breakfast, and no resort fee, the Laguna Riviera, we feel, offers our guests a tremendous value.

Front desk service from Ana was very cordial.  Yes, parking was tight but we lucked out on a good safe space by the office.  Yes, we had to lug all of our luggage down stairs and a steep path to the room.  Found the room air conditioned and clean.  Lovely deck, but everyone can see you and everyone needs to walk past to get to the beach.  Settle in to a comfy chair to relax in the room, close my eyes and .... what's that??  Sounds like a herd of elephants upstairs.  Back and forth, stomp stomp stomp.  Non stop.  There's two room above ours and ZERO noise insulation between our ceiling and their floors and decks.  Thankfully they were older and went to bed early, but",September 2011,none,none,"It is unfortunate that noisy neighbors colored this guests entire stay. While we cannot predict the occasional noisy family with kids that are having too much fun, when notified, we intervene and ask them to quiet down and respect our other guests. It is unfortunate that this guest had to endure the noise rather than contact the office.   During our recent remodel, cork was placed between all floors to help deaden the sound, but in the end, this is an ordinal wooden building that does not have the isolation of modern concrete towers. The Laguna Riviera is a classic ocean front property.  I must take exception to several of this guests opinions as I believe they have been unduly influenced and exagerated by their experience with the noisy guests.   1) The pool area is a salt water system for both the jacuzzi and pool. The most common compliment we receive since the conversion is how great the water feels on the skin and how fresh the area smells. No more chlorine fumes.  2) Not only do we not have a broken down pool table, we don't have a pool table at all.  3) Towels are replaced yearly and a single stain or hole takes them out of service. After this review I toured the room and the laundry to confirm we are not issuing frayed towels with the ability to scratch. 4) This room should have come with 2 bathrobes and if housekeeping missed one, a call to the desk would have had a second one delivered in minutes. The bathrobes also are replaced as needed and are of the highest quality made of high thread count Egyptian cotton. I still use mine daily from our first order in 2003 and it still feels like new. You can purchase the same brand and style in major department stores for $75-$95 each.  Our guest enjoy them so much that we have a Christmas rush on the ones we retail for only $65.oo ea. 5) We do not as a rule provide DVD players, but do have a couple on hand that we lend out for free. If maintenance is available they can install it, but off hours it is up to the guest to understand how to plug in and operate the complimentary DVD player.  6) There may be a small rust spot or two on the refrigerator, but it is not all rusty. Since it sits by a often open  double wide sliding door a few yards from the ocean the interaction with the salt air is unavoidable. The fridge is cleaned thoroughly after each guest checks out and operates perfectly.  While it is very unfortunate that this guest had their stay interrupted by the noisy group on the deck above theirs, I wish they had taken the time to let the office know so that we could remedy the situation before it colored their entire stay.

The lady who works nights was very nice allowing us to park in two spaces with our large SUV when a guy took up too much room with his mega truck.  The only downside was how thin the walls were.  On our last night we were subject to a four second love making session from the people downstairs that left us feeling more sorry for the girl than us.

As for the couple downstairs they will have to seek out their own solution as I found nothing beneficial as I perused the innkeepers manual for dealing with extraordinary events.

We take guest satisfaction very seriously and would have done what was needed to make this guest comfortable even if it meant upgrading her to a superior room. The room she occupied, while it can still see the ocean, is our second to least expensive. The rate this guest paid was only $124.20 for New Years Eve on the ocean in Laguna Beach.   I will be personally inspecting this room when the current guest checks out. We use comforters on most beds and if blankets or any linens are found with even a single hole they are donated to a local charity that helps the homeless and less fortunate.   While we did have internet outages during the record setting storms just after Christmas, a check of the logs shows that it was online and operating fine over New Years. We do have several neighbors and a local service that operate secure WiFi connections and if you do not select the complimentary service that we provide, and configure your computer properly, you will not get a good connection.   During New Years we show peak usage at 2.4 MB/sec which leaves a lot of room for more users and confirms the complementary system was operational. I apologize that this guest had difficulty connecting to it.

He may have felt he booked for 3 but it is simply not the case. The day which would have been the 3rd night had he booked it was already booked long before he made this reservation so a 3 night stay was not even possible.  Our check out time is noon. We called the room at 1:00 to see if it was vacant. The guest being woken up, verbally assaulted the front desk staff saying he was in for 3 days and is not going anywhere. The desk then explained to the guest that we have another guest checking into the room and we need it vacated. If he wanted to stay a 3rd night we would see if another room is available.  At this point the guest threatened physical harm to our staff if we were to push the issue. This guest went so far as to say he was friends with President Obama and would use this powerful connection to ""Destroy the life"" of the young man working at the front desk.  He again reiterated his position that he was not leaving and again threatened physical harm to our staff and hung up.  At this point to ensure the safety of our staff and guests the police were called in. They accompanied our clerk to the room. The clerk knocked on the door and as it opened the guest was in the process of lunging at our staff member until he realize that he was flanked by 2 police officers.  If this guest is truly in the hospitality business I should expect that he understands what the registration form means when he signs for a 2 day stay. He can consider himself lucky that the desk clerk did not press charges. In California if one feels physically threatened by the actions of another it is cause for arrest.

St. Ann'a beach is a nice little beach for swimming, surfing and snorkeling.  The property is near shops and restaurants.  The negatives are so bad they could be a deal breaker.  The property needs a major facelift. Moreover, there was an overwhelmingly horrible stench of toxic cleaning chemicals in most of the common areas, no doubt bad for the environment.

These parts of the review are quite accurate, and much appreciated.   And yes, as mentioned, we are situated on Pacific Coast Highway, the main travel corridor through town but contrary to the insinuation, this is not a negative.  Every hotel in Laguna Beach from the world famous Montage and on across the board is situated on this same busy street. Four or five  are actually on the ocean side of the street and offer direct beach access from the property, like we do at the Laguna Riviera. Others are on the other side of the street, or do not go all the way to the bluff or do not have direct beach access.   We are not situated between a busy street and a parking lot. We are between the highway and the ocean. We have residential to the north and south and retail across the street. If there was a large parking lot nearby it would be very useful however because of the tight parking situation that exists all over town. I invite anyone to view Google maps to confirm this.  The Laguna Rivier went through a major renovation and upgrade one year ago. Photos may be seen on our website, so contrary to this review, almost everything has been updated from the furniture, carpet, tile, bedding, window coverings and crown moldings to the wall mounted plasma TV's, iPOD clock radios, salt water pool, salt water spa and granite enclosed dual BBQ area overlooking the ocean. We even have more renovations coming soon on the front bluff and walkways once approved by the city.   With regards to noise, we would have responded immediately had the front desk been notified. This is Summer and we have a lot of families visiting and vacationing. They are enjoying themselves as one would expect, and this can create a little festive noise.   With regards to the property wide chemical odor, this is where I must take exception. The only time we experience any type of widespread change to the smell of fresh ocean air is when the tide is very, very low and you can then smell the seaweed and more distinctly the ocean. We use many ""Green"" cleaning agents including those based on orange oil. We use hypoallergenic detergents and softeners for our linens in consideration of guests who may have a chemical sensitivity. This is Laguna Beach where we have been eating bean sprouts and avocados since the 70's and avoiding toxic cleaning chemicals while doing all we can for the environment. This approach is evidenced in our chlorine free salt water pools, complete conversion to energy efficient lighting, and adopting all measures of water conservation.  If you are looking for a 5 star modern resort, I highly recommend the Montage. It is a stunning property with every imaginable amenity. If you are looking to vacation at an amazing location, in newly renovated rooms, on the ocean at a great price, at a property that has been a part of Laguna Beach culture and history, and in the same family for four generations then you will truly enjoy and appreciate your time at the Laguna Riviera, and we appreciate and look forward to your stay.",none,none,none,none,none,none,353,46

Dirt cheap however will not be found in Laguna Beach, and certainly not sitting on the sand overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

Not because the beautiful Laguna Beach sunsets have changed, but because the accommodations I have booked for all these years have changed drastically.  I have had a great experience in the past, but sometime over the past seven years, the management has changed hands and I have found them to be very inconsiderate and disingenuous.

We simply cannot, and will not, give into such incredible and unwarranted demands. With that said, we did make an extremely generous offer of a 50% refund AND a 1 week stay off-season in our 3 bedroom ocean front beach house (which rents for $600 per night).  One of our standards is fairness, to the guest, but also to us.  We feel we were being more than fair in making the very generous offer to her.  From her point of view, it wasn't enough.  People differ.  From our point of view, we did everything reasonable to accommodate her needs.  Due to real needs of other guests, we were unable to meet her repeated requests for special reserved parking for two vehicles. We regularly reserve preferred parking spots for those who are handicapped, very elderly, or otherwise in need of special assistance.  All parking is within easy access of the rooms and is complimentary. While this guest is quite able bodied we still accommodated the best we could, and gave her one reserved parking spot for her entire stay.   This guest never called and asked me if there were any upgrades or changes to the property. But even so, I have apologized both verbally and in writing that she was not notified of all upgrades and renovations in advance of her arrival.   This guest chose to stay and make full use of the property, its’ open decks, ocean views, and accommodations even though they live only 30 minutes away, and even though we had other rooms available, as did all of the properties in town due to the unfortunate current economic conditions. There were plenty of options including the Sunset Cove Villas or the Surf and Sand as she has mentioned. But, I must make one correction, while they do face the same ocean; their rooms start at twice the price of ours.   I will not take time addressing all the complaints this guest has such as concrete decks, (They are in fact not concrete. They are wood coated in commercial grade non-slip decking material, and have been for years), or hand railings repaired with tape that I must ask, how would that even work? I will instead, they are vacant, shoot and post some pictures of the rooms in question 302 & 303 in the accommodations section of our website and leave it to those reading to decide if they are to your taste and are suitable for your vacationing needs, because in the end that is the reason you are reading this.  The founder of The Laguna Riviera Beach Resort always adhered to the principles of honesty, fairness, and the highest standards of hospitality.  And, as I said, the best vacation experience a family can have.  As his grandson, I am devoted to maintaining those standards. Clearly it is not possible to please everyone, even after spending over a million dollars on new furniture, upgrades and renovation, as is evidenced here, and some people just don’t like change, but I believe the multitude of positive reviews we receive, reflect the true feelings of the vast majority of those who regularly vacation and enjoy their stay with us here at the Laguna Riviera.

This is not saying it's not there, my hearing is not that great. Due to the fact this reviewer experienced it at night and it stopped during the day, perhaps it's a failing street light.

It is pretty clean and you have the usual stuff like a bed, TV and a enclosed pool.  The thing that draws me to the place is the parking which is pretty good, can walk to pretty much everything and the beach is straight down.  Overall you should have a good experience.

And it had a little kitchenette which was also nice.  As far as the ""free parking"" goes, the number of available spots is very limited and we were only able to get a spot 1 of the 4 times we had to park.  The rest of the time we had to park on the street in a meterred spot.  The POSITIVES: Good location.  Great little back terrace with beautiful flowers, a public bbq grill and nice ocean views.  Free continental beakfast - nothing fancy but decent enough.  The NEGATIVES:  Pretty dingy property.  Very old uncomfortable bouncy mattress.  Not much privacy.

He would have bolted the second day for the nearest Marriott like some previous reviewers. I’d also like to point out that I’ve stayed at many, many beach resorts, and the ones that are right on the beach like this one tend to show the effects of the wind, salt and sand, regardless of price.
