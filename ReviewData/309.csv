none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Cozy,We stayed in the boat room which I will say is small but we were only in there to sleep and shower basically so in this case size didn't matter haha.  The restaurant/bar can be loud at night but they don't stay open super late so it didn't really bother us.  The room was clean and location was wonderful.

4 helpful votes,2 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Review from A to ZZZZZZ…,"The rooms themselves were clean and well-laid out. The paint was very bright. Personally, stop sign red banana yellow and lime green colors are meant for traffic lights, not a room for rest. The cleaning staff was friendly and accommodating. The managerial staff was combative while attempting to make up for most of what this “hotel” lacks. This place should get real and just become a hostel. It was so loud, perhaps it was just our (i.e., The Baja room). We found it odd that next to the bed was a heaping basket of ear plugs and a sound machine and later we learned why. During the day, the restaurant above is just doing their thing, but you’d think people were bowling with boulders upstairs. At night, the pipes and central air vents whistle like a train. We sent video to the",July 2022,none,none,"We are truly sorry that you did not enjoy your stay with us, April_Mae_J. Since you had several issues with our hotel, I'll address them in order.   Regarding our interior design: We chose to create a completely different vibe in our hotel. When you walk in, you will feel like you are visiting one of the many beautiful places we have experienced in our surf travels. In your room, the decor is Baja themed, so the bright colors and custom live edge wood slab countertops line up with that. We feel that the ""standard"" white walls and average fixtures & furnishing are boring. But, maybe that's more your style, and that's okay!  Regarding the noise disturbance and your claim of combative management: Hearing you say ""the management was combative"" is quite disheartening. I personally bent over backwards trying to help you, and am happy to provide you with screenshots of our conversations via hotel messaging, if your memory is clouded. When you mentioned that that there was a ""whistling"" noise from the vent in your room that was disturbing you, I gave you the option to check out early with a full refund. When you informed me that was not an option because you were getting married that day, I was very understanding, and I comped lunch and drinks for two to make things right. Then, when I asked to enter the rooms ASAP to investigate and hopefully fix or alleviate the unknown noise, so your stay was more comfortable, that was met with resistance. Even though this would take less than 30 minutes, you denied access to the room until 5pm because you were getting ready for the wedding. You said 5pm will definitely work because your wedding was at 6pm, and as I was arriving at 5pm, I got a message saying that I could not enter the room until 7pm, one hour after your wedding was scheduled to start. Normally, weddings don't start an hour late, so I was very confused by this.  We are a fun and lively hotel with one of the most popular restaurant's in town upstairs, so you will hear noises from above during hours of operation. Most guests love Nomads Canteen and the complimentary adult beverages provided with the stay, so they don't mind a little noise from above. The vent ""whistling"" noise that bothered you, has never been reported prior to, or after your stay. Possibly some people are more sensitive to noise than others.  Regarding Hostel vs Hotel: We are absolutely NOT a ""stock standard"" hotel, and VERY proud of that. Our hotel is a fun and creative space for people that want to enjoy something different. Our goal is to provide a completely unique hotel experience, and you can see from previous reviews, that the majority of our guests love it. One would say that we are not a Hostel, as we have private rooms only, with private bathrooms in all 7.   Again, we are very sorry that our hotel was not a good fit for your wedding night. Perhaps a 5 star hotel like the Ritz Carlton or The Montage Resort would have met your expectations. We wish you the best on your future travels.",none,none,none,none,none,none,12,309

Would have loved a full length mirror and shower mats that didn’t make you feel like you were on a skateboard. ;) The hotel is connected to and easily accessible to the restaurant upstairs!

But closing down the bar lasted until 11:30 and consisted of dragging bar stools and furniture around and general loud banging.  If I was on vacation, I probably would not have minded as this is a great location and the property and the room I stayed in were cool and funky and they provided two free drinks at said bar (which I didn’t use).

The good part is the rooms are fabulous, with boutique colorful furnishings and paint. The bad part NO",June 2018,none,none,"This review is very disheartening because I did my absolute best to make you happy, Firefozz. Here's a breakdown of what happened, in case you memory is cloudy.   When you contacted us a few days before you arrival date and asked to cancel, I issued you a courtesy credit. I was sympathetic to your situation, so I issued the credit even though that is outside of our cancellation policy. I did not hear back from you until I saw your first review. Even though I felt your review was uncalled for, I replied saying that your credit still stands.   When you contacted us the following summer and asked to use your credit, I was happy to accommodate. You booked separately from the surf team so you did not receive their 501C charitable discount. In fact, the surf team organizer went out of his way to tell me that your booking was 100% separate from theirs.  Nomads is located in the heart of Downtown San Clemente, walking distance to restaurants, shops and the beach. We have 10 parking spots that our guests are welcome to use and there is plenty of street parking in the area. I'm sorry if you could not find parking that was within a block. I guess you trade our perfect location for not so perfect parking.    Our restaurant does not close before nine and there are TONS of late night menu options that don't require the grill.   I'm very sorry that you did not enjoy our hotel. We are a lighthearted, fun and easy going place and it seems we just aren't a good fit for you.   Take care, Firefozz",none,none,none,none,none,none,43,309

Our cancellation policy, that you agreed when you booked online, is the standard for all small ""Boutique"" hotels in Southern California. Unfortunately, for very small hotels like us, it is impossible to refund last minute cancellations because we have such limited room inventory. Here at Nomads we only have 4 regular hotel rooms, so your reservation made 1/4 of our inventory unavailable for weeks/months.   As a courtesy, we ALWAYS offer a credit for a later stay, and I’m sure we offered this to you. We usually give 6 months to 1 year to use a room credit, and have even extended that even further, when a guest asks for more time.

We parked the car right in front (no charge). Quick walk to all the restaurants, pier & beach.  The owner is a great host. Our ""Bali"" room on the first night was really nice. It did remind us of our visits to Bali a bit. Room is big, bed was comfortable.

As a 42 year old, i've traveled the world surfing and working as a boat captain. I've lived in Costa Rica and Hawaii, and have to say that the hospitality here at Nomads equals or surpasses the places I've stayed at other world venues. Traveling solo I flew into San Diego and took the Amtrak Surfliner train up to San Clemente and Jeff,one of the owners, was there to pick me up and bring me back to the hotel. the same service was provided for the exit trip a week later ,this time by Sean. Sean, during my stay, made sure to have me at my contest heats ON TIME, provided local knowledge of the area, places to go have a meal, a beer,ect.... at venues other than",June 2015,none,none,Scott!

It was exactly what we wanted, and it resembled our way of traveling...Quality at no fuss to us! Sean (owner) was great with answering questions and was prompt returning my texts to his cell. Nomads is a place where there is no lobby. There is only access to your rooms through keyless entry. Loved that. The rooms reminded us of Bali and my boyfriend had surfed at all the places that were in the pictures on the wall throughout the corridors and upstairs.. The decor was awesome and apropos for the hotel's concept. My daughter was very comfortable here. We loved the bar/restaurant on top. Great",July 2015,none,none,Thanks Katherine!

8 helpful votes,15 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great find!,"My husband and I stayed in the California Room for a night away from kids. We were provided a code to get in as there is no ""front desk"". The room was very clean and had everything we needed including a small fridge and Kourig coffee maker. There was a small patio right outside the slider that leads out to the side street, where we enjoyed a cup of coffee before dinner. We were able to get ice from the canteen upstairs with no problem. The king bed was super comfortable!! The weather was warm but not too hot. There's a standing fan in the room, but it's a little loud and there's no AC so it might get a little warm in the hotter weather. You can open the slider but you're on the ground level. All in all this was a great room and really enjoyed our night away!",June 2015,none,none,Thanks for the review Lori! We are currently working on getting AC units in each room.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Should have made this our FIRST choice,"We traveled recently to California for the USA Surf Championships. I saw Nomads but was unsure; it was new and not directly on the ocean. We ended up renting a condo closer to the contest which left us with an open night before we flew out. We decided to take a chance on Nomads.Sean, was AWESOME! He welcomed this tired Grommom with a beer in their surf themed Cantina. My teenage boys and I instantly fell in love with the vibe of this place. The decor was perfect and the room super comfortable. The location was actually perfect.

When I saw on Facebook that were finally open and having a soft opening, I immediately made reservations. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable.  (The shower was absolutely gorgeous.)  They have everything you need: coffee maker, refrigerator, tv, wifi...the comforts of home.  It's within walking distance to Del Mar where there are a lot of shops and restaurants and if you're up to it a nice walk to the beach. The fact that you have the bar right upstairs with great food is a huge plus.  My favorite is the half & half Poke bowl...which i refer to as the ""Exotic"" bowl.
