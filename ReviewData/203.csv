none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,National Inn Garden Grove,"This is a nice establishment. Clean rooms, nice amenities, great staff and management. I’ve stayed here twice in November and October of 2022. With no problems. The beds are comfortable and if you need a microwave, you have an option to book a suite or you can use the community microwave in the washer and drier room. It’s in a great little hub of Garden Grove with plenty of great places to eat. If you decide to stay there check out the restaurants at Euclid and Garden Grove Blvd, you won’t be disappointed.   I recommend if your in town and looking for a place, its worth a stay.",October 2022,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,203

5 helpful votes,21 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,last minute Disneyland resurvation,"Had to modify our trip to Disneyland, so this hotel was available, The owners were very nice. We had an upstairs king bedroom. Clean and quiet with a refrigerator. Nice strong wifi too, it is about a 10 minute drive to Disneyland, but there are a lot of eating places along the way and what was especially good was a Costco for gas. if i had to, i wouldn't mind staying here again.",October 2016,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,203
4 helpful votes,11 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Surprise at the luxury of our room,"This room was far better than our Vegas strip hotels.  Big refrigerator, mico, plush carpet, new furniture,/ desk.  New AC.  The room was completely NEW and REMODELED.  We felt like a Royalty.
