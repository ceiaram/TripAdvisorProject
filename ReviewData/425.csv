The first night was $89 as it was a Saturday but then the rate dropped down to $69 (all excl. tax), i felt this was a little high for what i got. I would probably try the Best Western down the road next",January 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,93,425
60 helpful votes,58 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Close and Efficient,"We wanted a small, older hotel with personality (we hate chain hotels) and really loved Sun and Sands.  The room was small, efficient and well-priced. A couple minutes walk across the street to the beach, ten minutes to the pier and downtown Huntington Beach. Carrie (sp?), the manager, was very nice and answered all our questions.  They even have boogie boards for use by guests.  There is nothing fancy about this hotel, but they provided a nice television, microwave and refrigerator in the room -- as well as clean beds.",October 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,94,425

Very warm welcome from the owner, who had lots of info about places to go nearby. Good value for money, very short walk from the centre of town, would stay there again.",October 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,95,425

When I complained I was moved to a nicer room.  The owner then made me pay $22 extra a night for said nicer room.,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,96,425

I moved from another hotel that was in the city of Huntington Beach but was about 10 miles away from the pier/downtown and they accomidated me very quickly at Sun N Sands.,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,97,425
