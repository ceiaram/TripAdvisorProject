I was surprised when I arrived my traditional corporate rate of $99 went to $189.  I asked to speak with a manager and was first given the run around.  A few phone calls later was given a poor reply that rates had to go up. I understand a $5 $10 increase, but not $90.  They sell the same room for $99 on the weekends.  Its terrible if you want to build customer loyalty.  If this was full service hotel I could really understand, but its a basic room with the name MARRIOTT on the building.

We left the LA area in the morning and went to the beach towns during the day (Newport / Laguna). Then we stayed here that night.  Room was very nice and modern, as was the rest of the hotel.  They have a little pool that was great to take a quick swim - we had it all to ourselves.

The purpose of our trip was to visit with my wie's aunt in Santa Margarita. The hotel is close to shopping and restaurants where I-5 and the 405 split...it would help if you have a car with a GPS.   Very nice of the hotel to provide access to the internet in their lobby. They also provide fresh water with lemons and apples.   For $10.75 per person, the breakfast buffet did not look that appetizing so we went out to eat. I guess I was comparing it to the Marriott Courtyard where we stayed at in Portland. They had an awesome breakfast buffet.  Our room 205 was standard for a Marriott Courtyard but the shower was great. The workout room was small but adequate. Plenty of parking available on the property.  The",July 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,195,26

It's convenient to the 405 and 5 highways, and close to the John Wayne Airport, shopping and restaurants (Irvine Spectrum). The area around it is industrial and not very pretty to look at, but you're less than 20 minutes from the beach via the I-5 and Crowne Valley. The hotel is typical Courtyard Marriott, with nice, clean updated rooms, an outdoor lap pool and hot tub, and an open lobby where you can hang out. The breakfast buffet at $9 is a good one,  and the hotel also has a little market where you can pick  up soft drinks, beer, sandwiches, salads and snacks. You could basically pick up a quick beach picnic here. The staff is very friendly and helpful.",August 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,196,26
31 helpful votes,11 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Recommended, but not a resort destination in itself","Just spent 2 weekend nights in a room at end of hallway, next to stairs, on 4th floor.  Although not the most spacious floor plan, the room with two double beds was clean, comfortable and QUIET.  No great views from either side of this hotel (freeway on one side and industrial/business park on other), but easy access to freeways plus large variety of restaurants nearby made this a good location for rest and sleep.    Lobby is large with many nice sitting areas, although the volumn level of large television at far side was turned up so loud the night of check in that it was difficult to hear staff at the front desk.  All staff was polite, courteous and unobtrusive.  Breakfast buffet appeared adequate with generous hours of operation and an attentive server, but did not eat there.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,197,26

The staff are so friendly and helpfull it really makes you feel quite at home. I used to work for a company in Irvine and stayed at the hotel from two weeks to one month at a time, after travelling nearly 24 hours from the UK, the hotel is a very welcome sight.

The only thing they forgot to do at this hotel was put insulation in the walls, you can hear the other rooms television along with when anyone takes a bath.  We changed rooms twice and still the same problem.  My husband thinks its because it was an older courtyard thats why the sound is such an issue.

Room not ready but coffee appeared like magic as we sat and waited.  Every effort was made to ensure our stay and that of our friends was exceptional. Reception was one of the friendliest I have encountered throughout the world and there was always a friendly chat each time we passed through reception. Have never stayed in Courtyard Hotels before but after this initiation would certainly put them at the top of the list for future stays in America. For some the location would be a little out of the way although during our 4 nights, hotel seemed filled to capacity.

They give outrageously good military discounts. We pay $50.00 a night. The normal room rate is around $100.00 per night. The place is always clean and we really like the motif. It's extremely quiet as well. If you are coming out to ca this is the place to stay. The irvine spectrum is located about two miles away. There is always something fun to do over there.  It's very kid oriented as well. Make sure you rent a vehicle, the taxi's rarely show up. We waited almost two hours one night, and finally gave up. They just renovated that place it's very cozy.
