When I arrived, the questions arrised at once. There was no ""Welcome to our hotel"", at this ""hotel""!   Location is excellent. And terrible, because of it's closeness to Route-1 with traffic 24-7. Laguna city/beach 5 minutes walk from the ""hotel"".   This is not a hotel - this is a Bed & Breakfast, without the breakfast. With no service what so every. No room cleaning, no water, no ""how are you"" - nothing at all.  I am sorry, I will never return to this place. This felt like renting a room at a dodgy airbnb house, and quite pricy.

Located on Pacific Coast Highway, the cottages are a very short walk to the museum, a variety of restaurants and downtown Laguna. The bad news is the location...literally on the corner of Pacific Coast Highway so the traffic noise is truly horrible. I would never stay here again, solely due to the noise, which is a shame. Furthermore, while the cottage technically sleeps a max of 6 people, there is very little room to sit if you have more than 2 people.There were other smaller irritations like no instructions on how to use the heating/air system or the cable tv.
