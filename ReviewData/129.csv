58 helpful votes,60 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice property depending on price point and what you’re looking for.,"I was in the area for business and was looking to treat myself for a couple of days and was debating between this property and the Ritz. Overall I think this is a very nice hotel in a good location but does not offer a truly upscale experience like you would get at a more expensive property.   Pros:  the rooms are spacious and clean and have cute balconies. The lobby bar/restaurant has nice views and some tasty options. Staff was friendly and attentive. It’s walkable to the harbor, beach (both via a steep hill) and the lantern district. The park in front of the hotel has nice green space and beautiful views.  Yoga is offered in the mornings.   Cons:  Pool is smallish and I imagine it gets crowded at times.

There are a lot of options in this area but we thought we would get a real treat here. We were wrong and should have gone elsewhere.  That is a shame because this property has so much potential. The location is great and it is close to a lot of activities but then again, so are a lot of other hotels.  First off, we were very disappointed by their lackluster benefits for premium Marriott status. As a titanium member, I requested a suite upgrade using one of my certificates.

The mandatory $37/day valet parking was ridiculous and for the current rack rate we found the hotel to be a bit overpriced.

The difference between the two hotels could not be more extreme. In Montreal I paid a fair price and received more than I was expecting. Sadly the Marriott failed to meet the service I expect of their brand, especially being a resort and an expensive one at that.  For paying almost $400 a night I was shocked that wi-fi was not included but rather $20 for basic speeds. Guests are forced into using the valet service. While the valets do a good job I think I should have a say if I park my own car for free or use their service if I'm paying so much a night.

Thank heavens his company picked up the tab or else I would have felt seriously ripped off. It's not horrible but several issues make it feel much less than the four star resort it claims to be.

First, on Saturday there was no less than 8 weddings on the grounds and in the building. I think if they could sell the parking lot for a wedding they would have. I guess I did not realize how bad it could be. I realized they would pop you $25 for parking, but, I thought there would be street parking around. NO, the wedding guests take up the street approaching (which is a steep hill) The place was under renovation in the lobby, it is  a little old. The room was OK, nice bright colors, good bed, decent size and a pretty good view.

We were here for a business meeting (in the overflow group--other group at the Ritz).  The setting is nice, with a pretty harbor view from many rooms.  Our room overlooked the pool area, and beyond that the coastal area with a bit of ocean view.  LOTS of children running around, enjoying the pool and hot tub, which made it a bit hectic for us.  Several weddings during the long weekend we were there, which again raised the hectic level.  Room fine, nothing extraordinary.  Bed a bit too soft.  Fine for the price we paid--about $150/night.

I may have been a bit disappointed if I were a leisure traveler looking for a hotel on the beach with relaxing areas.  It seems that the hotel caters to large corporate meetings and weddings which eliminates a cozy and intimate setting.  The room was nice, clean and the coastal view was what I expected.  If you like to walk or jog outside, the public park (with good stairs to run up and down) and nearby scenic areas are great.  The views from the bar patio were very nice too.

4 helpful votes,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Resort?  More like Wedding Factory.,"This place is not a Resort -- I can't believe they get away with calling it that.    From the pictures on the website, you would think they have a luxurious property on the cliffs overlooking the ocean.  You are actually quite far from the ocean, although the views from the PUBLIC park adjoining the property are lovely.   I will agree with other reviewers in that the 'Coastal View' terminology used by the facility is suspect. We paid extra for a 'Coastal View' when booking, and when shown our room, the only 'Coastal View' we saw appeared when going out on to the unattractive, undecoratated plain cement patio.
