none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Spend the extra $ and book elsewhere,"I have to be honest this motel was chosen based off of their pictures on the website and the affordable price. What it didn’t show was the layers of filth covering every surface, the hairs in the sheets and bathroom surfaces, or the bug droppings along the baseboards. Evidence of bugs on the mattresses when my husband pulled the sheets back was the final straw. We spent 3 hours in the hotel total so I can only review on the actual room and the room of our other family travelling with us. We contacts the Disney travelling company we booked with and was given a full refund right away based on our experience and photo evidence. We were moved to the Howard Johnson.

Based on this, we rebooked for this years trip to Anaheim, but sadly we've had a very different experience that has led to us making contact with you.  The first night's stay was fine, and we had nothing to be concerned about. The staff were friendly, checked us in with no issues, and we had a good night's sleep. The reason for contacting you comes from night 2 and our subsequent issues...

The bus will pick you up and drop off at Disneyland then later drop you off right in front of the motel. There's really no need to take your car or walk.

We needed to go cheap, and with the deal we found, it was great. Room was very clean. Travelers should know that it is directly across from the freeway, so there are those sounds. That said, I requested a room on the opposite side, and they were happy to accommodate me. I am a *very* noise sensitive person, and was happily surprised that (with my noise machine on at night!) it all went very well. Our room was just up from where the shuttles come and go, so there was that noise to deal with.   The hotel would do well to take a street sweeper to the parking lot, and make the heavily used elevator and near area more clean looking. I was a little dubious when we arrived, as it looked",March 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,281,144

We picked it because of it’s cost (one of the cheapest places I could find within a reasonable walking distance) and proximity to Disneyland.  The room accommodations were simple and modern.  Since we were in the parks all day, we only came back to sleep, and for this is was perfect.  The parks were a little less than 1 mile away, about a 15 minute walk.  This was fine for our adult only group, but with smaller kids, it may be worthwhile to spend the extra $ to stay a little closer.  Cost wise though, everything else around was 50% more per night.  There is a pay shuttle called the ART if you do not want to walk.

The motel provided basic accomadations that were clean and the staff were quite friendly. The location from Disneyland is within an easy walking distance of about 10 minutes. If you so choose the Shuttle picks you up right outside the front door every 20 minutes. The Plus here is that there is only one stop before Disneyland.  They also have a basic pool and hot tub in the centre courtyard which is also clean and great for relaxing after wearing yourself out at the tourist atractions.

6 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Don't be Fooled, Motel 6 repainted with a red roof","This motel was very poor at maintaining its rooms and practiced rate hiking(was charged more for a weekday than a booked weekend).  The window would not open in the first room we stayed and you have to ask the front desk if you want shampoo.  The second room had a beeping smoke alarm due to a dead battery which they did change to their credit.  Also the remote control batteries were dead and the back was missing which they did not replace.  In addition,My friend who was staying next door to us found a ""crack kit"" under his bed and my brother-in-law and sister had their truck vandalized(graffiti) in the supposedly secured parking lot.  Although all of us experienced a poor stay, none were offered any discount or future discount rate for our troubles.

It was nice and then became run down. Since Red Roof has bought the place, the rooms are all BRAND NEW. I was very impressed. It is nothing fancy at all. It is very clean, with nice - helpful staff.  It has a very nice large pool. On the weekends they have on site security guards. Real ones who monitor the parking lot. I got a deal on the internet of $47.99 per night weekday and $55.00 weekend. I almost didn't share because I want to keep this one a secret, but hey - I have used this to find places - so there goes. If you want decent, clean, nice beds, comfortable, coffee in the lobby, newspaper delivered to your door and a wonderful pool and hot tub for a cheap price - GO",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,680,144
21 helpful votes,2 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,bare bones motel,"Knowing that we would only be sleeping one night in a hotel, I decided to take advantage of a $53 rate for my family of five. I was quickly reminded of the adage, ""you get what you pay for."" Thing that seem standard in other places (like coffee maker, fridge, toiletries) are missing at the Red Roof Inn. Only tea and coffee are available in the lobby. Ice maker on our floor was broken. There is no privacy...windows face a walkway. It also lacks privacy IN the room. The sink (and the bright light) faces the beds, and the only thing behind a door is the toilet/shower. It was cheap in all respects.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,681,144

We even had a nice office chair in the room, and plenty of room to set up the laptop to work. The staff was very helpful.Unfortunately, it was very rowdy on the weekend with people who came, it seems, just to party. (Three different groups told me they weren't here to visit the park, but just to ""hang out"" at the pool.)Two blocks from Disneyland, it's not the most convenient, but we just got such a good rate, and it was very clean.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,682,144
