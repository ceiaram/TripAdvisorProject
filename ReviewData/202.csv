Not here… $3.00 a load (of course California prices) and 3 of the 5 dryers are still out of service and 2 of the 5 washers are also out of service.  Trash cans left at the room doors to be emptied and stayed that way the whole day.

Only two dryers were working for this hotel. Parking is now charged. My 1 bedroom suite was clean but than the ice machine didn't work. I am pleased that breakfast is back to normal.
