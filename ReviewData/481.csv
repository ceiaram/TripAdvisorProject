none,2 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great motel, Front desk girl jenifr needs to go","Enjoy staying at the hotel over the years. Recently the girl at the desk , JENNIFER, was pleasant when we checked in,  but later that night turned into a un-balanced crazy person. Our parking pass {which she had handed me two hours prior) , was slightly obscured by my  driving glasses, causing  her to come un glued. This behavior will oscillate in the future , they need to seriously consider that she is not cut out for a service position.",July 2020,"Wi fi is strong, if jenifer is working, walk away",Traveled on business,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,481

We were a little worried about staying here because it has a sketchy reputation, but we were desperate for a  budget place to stay.   Pros:  Inexpensive, clean to the naked eye,quiet and the toilet didn't leak. Cons:  Not well maintained (two light bulbs out), in need of painting and other matters, dark even after replacing the bulbs and does not have a mini-fridge. I would not stay here for a week while sightseeing, but would use it for a quick one night stay.",October 2017,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,481
63 helpful votes,59 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Unfriendly reservations system,"This motel sounds really great and I was looking forward to staying there.  However, it's impossible to get a reservation.  First, they do not have an on-line system.  Second, when I called, it was too far in advance -- they only take them within a couple weeks of your stay or something.  Third, when I finally called back closer to the date, they said they could not hold my reservation after 6 PM, which is before my arrival time.  None of this is stated on their website.  So don't bother if you need some normal conveniences for planning.",May 2016,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,481
none,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,nice place,I have stayed at this motel a dozen times...the family who owns it are nice and friendly. I highly recommend it for the budget minded. The rooms aren't too extravagant but they work and clean. The pool is clean and laundry is clean.Located in a hidden are its safer than those bigger places. easy to get to Disneyland and Knotts Berryfarm as well as many food places.Again its family owned and operated..very family oriented place  I give it 3 and half stars out of 5 .Like I said we have been going there for 10 years plus and never get any surprises its always a good place to stay .Weekends are full in summer sometimes so call ahead and book early . Economy but clean is what this place is so save money and stay in this motel.They are missing some things like a refrig and cooking,December 2014,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,481
24 helpful votes,48 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best Deal in Town!,"I am not sure why there is a bad review on this motel. It is an excellent deal for Anaheim. The rates, tax inclusive, are $54 weekdays and $66 on weekends, holidays, and special events.  The room is very clean, quite large, and has a comfortable couch. There are non-smoking rooms available as well. The desk staff, all of them, are very friendly. There is also a 200-channel satellite TV. The bed is very comfortable and affords a pleasant sleep.  Public transportation options are great as well.   There is a bus that goes to Los Cerritos Mall (about a 45-minute ride) if you wish to shop. The bus stop is right across the street in front of a Del Taco. Once you check out of the motel, you can also transfer to a bus that will take you to El Monte (#577) (about an hour's ride) where",March 2015,"If you do not smoke, ask for non-smoking.",Traveled solo,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,6,481
108 helpful votes,176 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Old School Value,"Looking for a last minute room in the Anaheim area, after reading a couple reviews, I decided to try the Akua. It was as promised, clean and convenient. It is definitely no frills. The room was clean and neat. There was a big screen TV and comfy bed. You can upgrade to a room with two beds or a frig if you want. I opted for the ice-maker, which in the long run cost me less than the $2 charge for the frig. The AC is located back by the sink, so it can be cool to wash your hands ;) It did a good job of cooling the room. There is soap, but no shampoo, etc. The towels were basic as well, but effective. For the loss of a few ""extras"" you save a great deal. Parking is right in front of the door or near by. When I visited, the motel was nearly full.

2 helpful votes,6 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good place if your not looking for something super faNCY OR EXPENSIVE,I personally like AKUA's prices those are my favorites. The rooms are fine nothing to special. Just make sure you stay more up towards the front rather than in the back. The only problem is that rooms with fridges and microwaves are more towards the back. But still I would stay here sometimes just to getaway from family and relax.,November 2012,none,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,8,481

2 helpful votes,5 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good deal - pleasantly surprised,"This was the cheapest and closest hotel to where I was having a meeting in the morning and I was surprised that it was pretty nice. The rooms were clean (I was surprised to see the other review)  - and I had a quiet sleep. They also had some cute landscaping around, something you wouldn't expect from a budget motel (you can't beat $40 a night). The staff were professional. Only drawback is that it is located in an industrial part of town although there are some restaurants close by.",July 2011,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,10,481
6 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Bed bugs and roaches and broken air conditioner,"My personal opinion of this motel is a F+++++++++++++++++ i stayed there many times before and air-conditioning never worked right it , and on my last stay when i was watching TV and relaxing i got bit tons by bed bugs.  I notified management they saw it and then the manager on her cell phone offered me another room or to change the bedding.  She got mean mouthed and said never come back.  Trust me avoid this motel and go to motel 6 on state college its more expensive but worth it, they don't take pets at the akua and if you smoke they got few rooms for you hope you want bit and companion bed bugs at home now my house is showing signs of bedbugs and didn't before this stay at akua motor inn don't go there",June 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,11,481
