If they‚Äôre going to charge so much for a room the least they can do is buy some cleaning supplies to clean up this place.

The hotel does not have a lift of any sort for the second floor, therefore consider this if climbing stairs is an issue.  They did move us to a lower level room for the rest of our stay after the first night. The room did have a microwave and mini fridge in each room.  The beds were not the most comfortable but they certainly were not the worst either.  There was mold/mildew about the size of a quarter in the bathroom, which was concerning.

Only takes about 10 minutes using back streets and you can get right to Mickey & Friends easily. The staff at the hotel has always been great.   Our second stay was earlier this year in February. We stayed 6 nights this time as it was a much longer trip. Same as before, the room was decent, clean enough. Beds are not super comfortable, but they're not terrible either.

It is a classic motel, one long row of rooms over two stories all with entrances directly from outside and ample parking below.  Travelling time to disneyland is circa 15 minutes in the car.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice for sleeping,Found this place on Booking.com and saw that the reviews were pretty good for the price. So my boyfriend and I chose this to stay when I visited for a week. The rooms are small. Decor on inside is outdated. Older T.V with basic cable which wasn't a big problem since we were out all day. Most of the room is clean. They could use some deep cleaning as there was mold on the celling above the shower. There was also some mold along the top of the tile in the shower and around the inside of the sink. Parking is great and its quiet. Food and entertainment near by.
