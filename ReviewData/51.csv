none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Horrible,"I know I paid less so I wasn’t expecting much. But I expected at least close to maybe  a motel 6 . I dont feel safe here . Half naked hookers close to motel. Room smelled awful when we got here. I tried to put my charger on usb outlet and it like broke my charger, it looked like it was burned . Writing on mirrors. Not clean whatsoever . I wont ever stay at a motel like this again. Even if it costs alot it will be worth it.",December 2022,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,51
none,3 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst motel I've ever been too,"I'm a relatively picky person when it comes to hotel cleanliness but I have never seen a more disgusting motel/hotel in my life!  First off, the smell when we opened the door was appalling and the window did not open to air it out.  It was like they didn't even try to clean the room.  The floors were horrendous! The walls and switches were visibly dirty, the heater was filled with layers of dust and dirt and cigarette tar.  The microwave was rusted out and there were multiple burn holes in the bedding. The nastiest was the unmentionable dried fluids on the headboard, like I don't even want to think about it!  Not to mention short and curlys inside the bed sheets.  The outside walkways were covered in trails of black nasty sludge and debris everywhere.  Luckily (and surprisingly)",September 2022,none,none,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,3,51

none,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Some effort in cleanliness could make or break an impression.,"Most parts of Anaheim are nice. The cheaper hotels aren’t always what the picture says and they don’t have the same quality of cleanliness, which I think if the cheaper ones spent some time going the extra mile caring about leaving an impression, took their time, or hiring some more cleaners, people would stay more often at the cheaper hotels if they are ones on the side with trying to save money while visiting Disneyland or surrounding areas and enjoy their stay instead of being let down. The area of this hotel isn’t the greatest but when you are in your room it is quite, which is nice. I don’t want to sound like the location is that horrible (it’s not bad if you plan on just staying in your room to sleep) but the surrounding areas aren’t that nice.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Hotel is a SLUM. Prostitutes & Drug dealers in parking lot. HORRIBLE customer service,"A Drug deal was going down in parking lot when we arrive. There were 3 prostitutes in the parking lot as well. Upon stepping  out of our vehicle my wife was cursed out by a homeless person. Felt in danger and we immediately canceled our stay and left. Kevin, the manager, refuses to provide a refund for the 2 rooms I prepaid for. Do NOT STAY HERE and put your family in danger.",July 2021,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,7,51
