This place delivers about what you expect from an Econo Lodge. Things are a little worn, but generally clean. It was a little noisy in the late evening, but not terrible.  Located very close to Knotts Berry Farm and a few blocks from several chain restaurants and 1/2 block from Keno's Sports Bar, which had a veru filling dinner special at a great price. The staff was very plesant and helpful, even though the first room they sent me too had not been cleaned yet. The breakfast is very basic; coffee, huice and muffins.",July 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,34,464

The bed is comfy & the room is clean and orderly, it is just old and has a slight smell. Normally it would be acceptable, but I did not feel safe & it was too noisy. Breakfast was very nice with muffins, toast, juice and coffee. It is nice having that hot coffee & toast there in the morning.",January 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,35,464

Fridge and microwave work well, must say that. And wi-fi does work and is free. If it werent for the simple fact we only needed to sleep here and really couldnt afford more, we never would have stayed after I walked in the door. I would never stay here again!

We booked a room at this hotel via the Internet due to it's proximity and moderate price.  It was only $46 a night for the two of us.  Once we arrived at the hotel, on a Tuesday night, we noticed that one of the rooms had a jacuzzi tub and we asked if it was available.  The gentleman at the front desk said that it was and it would be $100 a night which we agreed to.  The hotel has room entry doors to the outside so you can park near your room.  Our upgraded room was nicer than we expected.  We had a refrigerator, hair dryer, microwave, and all the lights worked and the king sized bed was comfortable.    The kicker was the jacuzzi, as it was larger than we expected, with strong jets once",November 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,37,464
3 helpful votes,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good experience,"We booked a room at Econo Lodge North in Anaheim because all the hotels near Disneyland were full or extremely expensive due to a large convention in town.  The Econo Lodge was affordable, had what we needed, and was an easy fifteen minute drive to the Disneyland Resort via local roads.  The five freeway is shorter, but we used local roads to avoid any freeway and convention traffic.  The motel is an older, remodeled building that has two floors and rooms accessible from the outdoors.  Parking spaces are adjacent to the rooms and surrounding a pool.  We stayed for seven nights and there appeared to be many empty rooms on the weeknights while Friday and Saturday the motel seemed full.    The room had the basics plus a microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, and hair dryer.  The",January 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,38,464

Although it says, ""Free Wireless Internet"" on a pamphlet in the room, you can only get that if you book your reservation through a website I've never heard of. You should made sure your the lightbulbs in your lamp work, because none of ours did. But one did turn on and off if you moved on the bed. This wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't gotten up at 12:00 am to use the bathroom and find a couple of crickets on the carpet. I thought I heard some, but didn't think they'd be in our room. Then when more came along, we asked for a room change.
