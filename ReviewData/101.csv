The rooms were clean and the requested pack-n -play was in the room upon our arrival.  One night during our stay the fire alarm went off around 11:30PM. There was no communication from the hotel staff. Afterward, it was difficult to rest comfortably not knowing why it went off. I had to go to the front desk the next day to ask what had happened. It was a false alarm in the laundry room. Nothing was offered other than an apology.  Overall the breakfast was good but lacked day-to-day variety.

The servers and cook (Omar and Isaiah) at Spoons were amazing and handled the crowds well and in a timely manner. The dinner food was great. The breakfast crew was good but the eggs were cold on multiple mornings and one day they'd run out of fruit by 9:30 and even though breakfast was supposed to go until 10 they said they didn't have any more. The young man at the counter during the fire alarm might need a refresher on protocol because he seemed a little unsure of things but did ok overall.

Before booking this hotel, you should look at the map and make sure you understand that most rooms if this hotel are right next to higher traffic streets. What I did not like about the hotel AT ALL was the breakfast experience. This hotel does not have a kitchen so they prepare breakfast in the dining area which does not have a vent/hood to take the smell of the food out. They cook hash brown, bacon, pancake, etc right in the dinging area each morning.

I appreciate your concern about the smell as this is a challenge we are addressing for a third time since the hotel has opened.  The exhaust system initially was not large enough to handle breakfast cooking and we have just installed a new larger capacity exhaust fan that should eliminate the odors.  For other potential guests reading this review, please know that the kitchen is not in the ""middle"" of the dining room.  We do have an open concept cooking area/dining room common in many hotels and restaurants.  Breakfast ends at 10 am so I understand your confusion when food was being put away at 11 am.  I would like to apologize for the breakfast server's attitude, it is unacceptable and not an example of our normal guest service as evidenced by other TripAdvisor reviews.

It is a visually appealing hotel with friendly staff. My son left his phone charger and they arranged to mail it to us. The complimentary breakfast is tasty and substantial. Eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, yogurt, fruit, cereal.  There is happy hour with complimentary sodas and wine. The sundry, snack & gift shop nook is a nice convenience. There is an atmosphere of environmental responsibility that went that little bit too far.

First I am so sorry the sign for breakfast was not clear.  We do encourage our guests to ""take all the food they want, but eat all the food you take.""  Our request to not take food to the sleeping rooms is not intended to minimize food waste, but instead stop food being accidentally mashed into carpets, spills in the hallways and elevators and uncovered leftovers attracting ants (unfortunately these scenarios happen every day).  I absolutely agree that one use plastic glasses are not environmental friendly.  The hotel opened using glass glasses but after the 60 Minutes show a few years ago that highlighted how unsanitary glass glasses can be in hotel rooms, the majority or our guests requested wrapped plastic glasses, we could not convince our guests that our glass glasses were clean.

I said I am a very light sleeper - please did they have something on the top floor as I can't sleep when I hear people above me. Though I checked in at 3pm, the answer was a curt no (lady checking me in, young Hispanic lady for any managers reading). Sure enough I had a leadfoot above me pacing and as a result lost my sleep.

The hotel is located right next to a busy highway. Very noisy. Sound insulation of windows and walls is bad. Noise from the road is heard all night.

I am glad you found the hotel to be clean and comfortable, but am sorry the energy saving system was not explained to you thoroughly.  All guests are given 2 key cards, once to access their room and one to put into the energy system card holder for the duration of a guest's stay.  This allows the room lighting system to be on at all times, with a guest using the regular light switches to turn off/on lighting.  Electrical outlets are not wired into the lighting system and work 24/7; so charging phones or computers is not a problem.  You are correct that the hotel does not serve complimentary sodas at breakfast and will not do so in the future.  Our Breakfast is extensive and free and to be able to continue to provide it to our guests on a complimentary basis we are not always able to serve everything our guests request.

I would welcome any suggestions you might have to improve our breakfast.  I would also like to apologize if your room was not cleaned as early as you wanted it to be, a call to the Front Desk by our guests requesting specific times to clean a room is always welcomed.  Otherwise cleaning varies every day depending on the number of checkouts, what time guests checkout, how many arrivals the hotel has expecting their rooms to be ready by 3:00 pm, and the times the stay over guests leave their rooms.  I am sorry you were disappointed in the Hotel but appreciate your comments. Sincerely, Christine Smith General Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,800,101

I apologize for the dry cleaning mix-up and I have issued a full refund to your credit card for that charge, and I agree it was an outrageous charge and I have spoken to our dry cleaning company.  I am sorry you found the room uncomfortable, I would ask that when guests find something wrong with their room, whether at an Ayres Hotel or any other Hotel, they let the desk know ASAP so another room can be provided.  I am also sorry you found our complimentary breakfast; eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes, pancakes, juices, fresh fruit, cereals, granola, pastries, breads, coffee and teas, to have limited choices.

I searched for over a month for a reasonably priced hotel for a quick 2day/3 nights Disneyland getaway.
