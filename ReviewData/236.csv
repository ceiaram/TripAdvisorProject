We called the front desk twice and they did nothing. Stayed a few hours on a 2 night stay and no refund or call back from the manager. There is a glass barrier on check in keeping hotel staff safe from the people in the lobby. I should have realized this was an unsafe place then.

We have never stayed at a Rodeway Inn before, our expectation was low, we know it is not the Ritz. We arrived very early 11.am and were able to check in, put out stuff in the room and hit the beach!!!!   Thank you. We were in 205 one of only 2 suites they have, (not really a suite just a larger room) We were only there to sleep and shower, while on a 3 day beach getaway, so it was just about ok. No breakfast due to covid, if they did have breakfast you would need to take it back to your room. TV in our room was tiny? no big deal we were there for the beach, not to watch TV.

They STILL charge the same price, there is no discount given, yet there is no breakfast provided. They could even deliver muffins to the room and some fruit if they dont want you to touch things. These little things, some breaky, some better wifi, some toiletries, are what makes a stay pleasurable versus antagonizing.
