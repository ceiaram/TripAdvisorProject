We were EXTREMELY dissatisfied with our accommodations. The hotel was filthy and the bathroom smelled like urine. We looked for other hotels to stay at but there was no availability that met our budget. We ended up going to Ralph's down the street and purchased CLOROX, disinfectant wipes, lysol spray and a room diffuser, just to clean our room and somehow manage the horrible oder of the hotel. The arm rest on the chairs provided to sit in the room had not been wiped and after using several disinfectant wipes, we were able to see the actual color of the chair (tan) instead of black. We are not exaggerating! This hotel claimed free wifi",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,530
