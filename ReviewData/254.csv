However, I did need to call a few days after checking out to request an invoice. I attempted to explain that I just wanted to check the card that was used for payment.

When I asked about this- I was informed that someone in the room next to us had complained that the smoke was blowing in through their windows...

Carmina needed to clean the room as it was one of our busiest holidays so yes, she was certainly trying to help you along as she is housekeeping and under pressure to get the rooms clean. You had mentioned you worked at another Best Western. Being a fellow hotel employee, you would know July 4th is a very busy day trying to accommodate late check-outs as well as guests trying to check in as early as 8:40 am when check-in time is 3 pm. There were no late check-outs on July 4th for you or any guests. We TRY to accommodate late check-outs but they certainly are not guaranteed, especially on a holiday in a boutique hotel.  We gave you a 11:30 check-out time but still were unable enter the room until 12 pm due to you still being in the room.   As far as the problem with your room, Anita reported the problem right away. It was the manager on sight calling your room the second time. The manager waited at the front desk to assist you as most guests with such a problem always address the front desk to try and resolve the issue. With such an issue, we were slightly confused why you would want to stay LONGER in a room that you were uneasy in.   We are glad to hear how awesome you think Andrew and Carmina are and how the cleaning staff delivered on your expectations for fast and consistent service. We hope to see you again in the future. Please call the hotel directly for late check-out information.  Sincerely, Anne Goddard Front Desk Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,81,254

The noise levels are truly too loud and cannot be masked.  If you wait to request a room at the back until you arrive, you won't get one.  Second, book early if you need two beds; the sleeper sofa is far too uncomfortable to get any sleep.  The mattress was all springs.  Third, if you like a good breakfast, plan for an added expense to eat elsewhere.  The quality of the breakfast is very, very low.  Fourth, if you are coming in the summer and plan to use the air conditioner, be sure to bring along ear plugs.  You will not believe how loud it is as it blasts on and coughs off.
