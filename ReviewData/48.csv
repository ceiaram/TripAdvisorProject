When staff looked at it they couldn't fix it and suggested we move to another room.  The hotel was sold out so it wouldn't have mattered.  Bathtub wouldn't drain as well.  I had to call someone in to plunge the water out of it.  Also the toilet clogged up.  Part of it could be due to the fact it was a .8 gal per flush toilet.

This wasn't the smell of fresh smoke. It was obvious that someone had smoke in this room and it was in the carpet and the walls now. They should not advertise a stinky room was non smoking. If it used to be a smoking room then they changed it to non smoking then they needed to have replaced the carpets and painted.
