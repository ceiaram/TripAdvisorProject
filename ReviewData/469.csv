Oakwood leases several apts. in a bigger complex and furnishes them including the kitchen.  Not the latest style buy very functional.  The only complaint was the web site which listed Lake Mission Viejo access - but it was wrong, lake access is for home owners only.  Great pool, work out room, and location - right near ""the 5"" at Crown Valley exit and lots of shopping and the beach [20 minutes].",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,469
