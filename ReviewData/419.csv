14 helpful votes,7 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,very comfortable friendly place,"The price is very good. They offer basic rooms,with multiple different room layouts(kitchenettes,disabled,family room,etc). All rooms were clean,and I always feel safe when visiting. The location is great because Disneyland is only 2 or 3 miles,Knott's Berry Farm about 4/5 miles away and your across the street from all types of restaurants,movie theater,Costco and night clubs,bars and sushi restaurant. The train station is only 1 mile away along with the old spaghetti factory. Definitely recommend staying here.

It was a NIGHTMARE from beginning to end. We booked through booking.com since was a close location to go to Disneyland. After a very long trip all we wanted was a shower and a good sleep. We didn’t get either. The room was filthy, old and with a bad stale odour. As soon as I stepped in the shower I saw beard hair on the walls. I just closed my eyes and had a quick shower.. I reached the towels and not even one of them was clean! Stinky and full of stains.. I tried at least to use the hairdryer and guess what?! It was broken! At this point I just wanted to scream and I went to bed. The pillows were yellow.. I had to use one of my t-shirts to cover it. The next day after washing our faces with COLD",December 2018,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,419

Manager said he had not received it, and refused to let me check in even though I could show the reservation. He said I should come back at 6 o'clock and see if they had received the reservation by then. I said I was not willing to wait that long and he told me to cancel the reservation the. When I asked to use the internet to do the cancellation he said their internet was down, and that was of course the actual reason he hadn't received the reservation. I canceled and stayed elsewhere.",August 2018,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,419

We stayed three nights and the fourth night we were out until 2pm. They damp our gear( luggage, suitcases out of the room) We lost phone and charger etc.. The hotel never admit there are phones and charges etc...  What's more, they changed one more day on a different credit card.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Do not stay here! Worst customer service!,"Do not stay here!!!! Absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life! When I first checked in the man at the front desk interrogated me with questions asking me if I had any extra people staying with me even though I paid for 2 bedrooms.  Then he repeatedly asked me where I was going and why I needed 2 beds and had me promise him that I was not going to bring any extra people to the room. He had no business asking me a bunch of personal questions about my stay and definitely not the best way to greet someone. I went out and got back to the room and brought a friend with me. As I walked through the door the phone rang not even a minute later. I picked up and the man told me that since I brought someone back to the room I needed to pay extra money. I said ""ok",November 2016,none,Traveled with friends,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,7,419
18 helpful votes,22 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good Value,"I spent two nights here and was very happy with the place.  It is a motel in Fullerton, with good access to shops and restaurants. There is a diner and Starbucks almost next door, and other food outlets, and shops such as Walmart and a coin laundry nearby.   It was about a 15 minute walk from Fullerton Metrolink station, although I think there is a bus route along here too. Being a motel parking was not an issue.  It provided free wifi in a large room equipped with a King sized bed, small sofa and coffee table. The bathroom was ok, without being anything special.  I thought that this was very good value compared to some of the other places in the region I had stopped on the same trip.",April 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,8,419

We found it to be very acceptable. the area didn't seem threatening, had several paces to eat within walking distance, the room was clean and reasonable.

The location is close to theme parks however, there are a lot of homeless milling around. Lots of restaurants within walking distance but I wouldn't go out at night alone. We had a shabby room with a 3 inch cockroach in it. We checked out within an hour after Mr. Roach made his appearance. The owners were surprised as it was their best room (121) and offered us another. We declined and wanted a refund. Alittle hesitant about refunding until we showed them the video of Mr. Roach climbing up the bathroom wall.",July 2015,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,11,419
49 helpful votes,34 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Pleasantly surprised,"Budget friendly hotel close to Disneyland.  If you are on a budget and need a place to stay close to Disneyland check out this no frills budget motel.  The price was right.  I don't ask for a lot. I just wanted to stay somewhere that was clean and didn't have bugs.  This fulfilled both of those needs. When I say no frills that is exactly what I mean.  There is no coffee maker, hair dryer or even alarm clock in the room.  You will be provided with soap, cups and an ice bucket.  The rooms do have fridges and microwaves so this was a plus.  Never had any issue with the Wi-Fi.  Had a good strong signal all the time and I was at one of the furthest points away from the office. Worth a look if you need a good and inexpensive place to stay",June 2015,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,12,419

Our rate actually was less than $75.00 with the offered discounts so very pleased. Yes the facility is old and a bit retro, but our room with king size bed, & flat screen TV was very clean and smelled freshly painted. Staff was friendly and gave us a room substantially away from Harbor blvd & street noise that provided a quiet night of rest.
