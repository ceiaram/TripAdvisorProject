It's about a 1/2 mile walk to the Disneyland entrance. If you don't want to walk that far, you have two other options. You can walk across the street to the Disneyland Toy Story parking lot and take the shuttle to the entrance. You can also ride the transit bus, which picks up along convention way.

We had been before and stayed off property at another resort down the road, so we already had certain expectations of the quality of the hotels in the area That being said, we got exactly what we paid for in this resort. The staff that I dealt with were helpful, but not outstanding. The rooms felt old and worn, but clean enough that I can't complain, and the beds were surprisingly really comfortable. It was about a 15-20 minute walk to the parks, which was great, and there is a CVS one block away which is very convenient.

The best thing about the hotel is its proximity to the Disney parks. It is also pretty affordable. We only paid $70/night during the week after christmas so I was pleased with that. For that price I don't expect the Four Seasons but I do expect courteous service.   During check-in the girl at the front desk was exceedingly rude to both me and my wife. It was as though we were an extreme annoyance by wanting to stay there. This kicked off our stay on a bad note. We brought our son's pack and play for him to sleep in.

First, I will mention the good things about this hotel.  The price was very reasonable.  The outside of the hotel, landscaping, and lobby appeared to be pretty nice.  The location wasn't bad either, it was about a 20 minute walk to Disneyland.  They charge for parking ($12 a day) which is typical for the area.  There was plenty of parking and it is gated.  They charge for a shuttle to Disneyland which is also pretty typical.  Really not a big deal considering how reasonable the rate was.  The size of the room was decent.

The location to disneyland is very close but to walk to the front gate and back (after an entire day of walking) looked pretty long. They charged $12 for parking but I think that is pretty standard with hotels in this area. Paid around $60 for one night, this hotel is not worth more. Did not eat at the restaurant or use room service. The rooms were okay to just sleep in but depressing decor and if you are bringing your family here or are here for a long stay I would not recommend it.

It is an older hotel that has not seen renovations for some time but on a budgeted vacation it works well.  The walk is about 15 minutes to the parks and it is a good idea to purchase the trolly tickets as the walk home feels much longer.  Pool was clean  with lots of chairs and never too crowded.  I do not recomend eating at this hotel.  Two pops and an appietizer of mozza sticks cost over $14.00.  Had breakfast once and was extremely disappointed with the poor quality of food and the price.

I had no problems with the shower going from hot to cold and didn't experience the elevators being slow (although I was only on the 3rd floor). It is in a good location and IS within walking distance to Disneyland, about 3 blocks/10 minutes. If you have little kids you probably wouldn't want to do the walk, but it is quite close. We watched the fireworks at Disney one night from the street in front of the hotel. I would stay here again if the price was right.",October 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1038,142

It is too far to walk to Disneyland so you would have to take the shuttle, which we find is not convenient, as we like to return to our room in the heat of the day to eat lunch and refresh for the long evening ahead.  The rooms were adequate, but with double beds, not queens.  I think that because they have a lobby and banquet facilities they consider themselves a classy hotel but they didn't even have shampoo in the room!  The bathroom was in need of repair as it was old and tired, and the water temperature in the shower was hot and cold suddenly.

40 helpful votes,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Clarion Anaheim Review,"Review of Clarion Hotel Anaheim Resort   First, I need to let you know that we chose the Clarion out of the Get Away Today brochure.  It was the most reasonably priced hotel we could find that was supposedly within walking distance of the Disneyland Park.  We chose Clarion because they had a 4th night free promotion that was available all year long.  The service people on the Get Away Today Vacations were very helpful and patient with this high maintenance customer.   Eventually we booked a 4-night stay arriving on August 17th 2005. Out trip was sort of last minute so we had to have Get Away Today send our information directly to the hotel.  This was a convenient service.    We arrived at about Noon in the hopes of being able to check in early, we first went to the Front desk.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1040,142

The rooms are always clean, the lobby is nice and the staff is friendly. The only complaint I would have is that the water in the shower changes from hot to cold... Also, the walk from the hotel to Disneyland is kind of far, but if you are driving to the park everyday like we did (free parking because our annual pass) then its well worth it because it is fairly close.

The hotel is severely outdated; walking through the hallways there is a musty, old smell.  The elevators are in a word, SLOW.  Thankfully I was only on the 2nd floor so we resorted to the stairs most of the time.  The Front Desk staff as a rule was less than congenial...their favorite response is a negative one.  When we went to our room, we stepped in and were hit with the smell of a smoking room (we don't smoke) so we immediately turned around and went back to the front desk.  They said we should have made it clear that we wanted a non-smoking room at the time of reservation.  The showers?  They bring some comedy.

I picked this hotel because of the proximity to the Anaheim Convention Center. Literally walking distance of two minutes.  PROS: clean room convenient distance to convention center no outside noise heard in the room  CONS: $10 a day parking fee staff attitude to guests - barely polite elevators - slow  MY EXPERIENCE: We booked the hotel through hotels.com. I specifically indicated a room with double beds but when I got to the hotel they had my reservation for only a king. Clarion staff was quick to indicate it was a hotels.com booking error and they could not accomodate a room change due to the heavy holiday period. Even after I booked the hotel in February.

We stayed on a 5 nights for the price of 4 plan, which helped. We arrived at 10 am, but were immediately given rooms although standard check-in time is 4 pm. We were on a non-smoking floor as requested; our room had microwave, refrigerator and coffee percolator, a balcony with a little bit of a view and a safe. The beds were comfortable and everything was clean and serviced daily. It may not be the newest hotel, but we were happy there. Disneyland is 10 to 15 minutes walk away, but the Anaheim shuttle stops at the door. Breakfast was not included, so we made our own. Had dinner in the restaurant one night, which was reasonable.

Upon entering into the room, I felt like this is where the Golden Girls would stay if they came to CA.  The room was done up in light beachy colors and the furniture looked like it came from Don Ho's yard sale.  I had a room with 2 double beds (both like rocks)  There was no desk in the room so if you want to use the internet, it is on top of a dresser where the TV is located.  Tried to get on the internet, didn't work.  Called the front desk and they said they dont have any tech people in the hotel and it is owned by another company.

We visited Disney Land  during the time that our room would be ready.  We thought the Clarion had its own shuttle?  Read the internet ad, it says ""shuttle available"".  You have to share a roaming shuttle for $3.00 per day per person; so we walked.  The room was great, but is slightly dated.  It was clean, quiet, and large.  The staff is good and everyone we met were helpful and friendly.  The lobby was undergoing new tile?  We enjoyed the stay and comfort.  There is a $9.00 per day uncovered parking .

The room we were given was HUGE, complete with fridge, microwave, tea & coffee making facilities and a seperate very well lit vanity/make up area, which would go down very well with female guests. The room & bathroom were very clean, however corridors seemed in need of some refurbishment. Floors  have inexpensive vending machines on each landing, $1 can of Coke.
