The hotel was booked and we needed to check in by 1:00 p. m. and it did not look possible, but 20 mins later the manager said, he could put us in a suite and get us checked in. Wow! That was great. Plus everything I need after that, the staff took care of right away. My grandkids live near by and I have always enjoyed and looked forward to my stay here, very clean, quite and all around comfort; lobby, pool, weight room & etc. Plus, there brunch is one of the best; it is an added treat during my visit.",July 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,405,221
187 helpful votes,184 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Quite Pleasant,"I went to northern Orange County on a family visit, and didn't particularly want to stay in the bustle of the Disneyland area.  I chose this hotel because of its #1 status on TripAdvisor.  All the reviews are accurate; check-in went smoothly with no waiting.  Hotel personnel were ALWAYS friendly and helpful.  My room was spotlessly clean and in perfect condition.  There was a bottle of Fiji drinking water if I wanted to pay $5 for it.  That, along with the few items in an alcove next to the front desk, was more than just a bit overpriced so I went to the mini-market nearby (there's several of them just under the 57 freeway overpass on Nutwood) for whatever provisions I needed.  I'm allergic to feather down pillows and awoke the second morning with my eyes all red and puffy.  A",January 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,406,221

Now this is no Four Seasons but I had a standard room for less than $120/night and it really was nicely appointed. The room was completely updated and the bed and bedding were excellent quality. I ordered room service and the prices were reasonable. I would certainly stay here again.,May 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,407,221

First impression: Very good location, right off the 57 freeway at Nutwood. There is construction going on, so getting into the lot was a little tricky, but there was ample parking in the lot/parking garage.  Checkin went well. There were a couple people in line ahead of us, and we waited only about 5 minutes. We were given our room, a map, and we were on our way. We got to our room and someones stuff was still in there. They obviously had not checked out. We went back downstairs and told them. They were surprised, of course, to find out that that room was still occupied. They didnt have any other rooms available with 2 beds. Would we take a 1 bed room? I said I would rather not, because I",August 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,409,221

77 helpful votes,86 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A Very Good Choice,Had a one-night business trip stay in mid December 2005.  The hotel is just off the freeway and has free parking.    Had a nice room that was recently renovated.  Everything was redone with the exception of the shower/tub.  My room faced away from the freeway and was very quiet.  My only complaint was the stale smoke odor from previous occupants.  It was noticeable but tolerable.  The buffet breakfast was good and is typical of what I have encountered at other full service Marriotts.  Lots of business travelers during my stay.  Seemed like an upscale crowd.  They have a good sized outdoor swimming pool and a jacuzzi.  I usually stay in the Anaheim area but will consider this location for future stays.  The key is to try to dodge the peak commute times (which can be a challenge).,December 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,411,221

There are two restaurants across the street, one Indian and one sports bar. We ate at the Indian restaurant, Taal, and had an excellent meal and service.

Although it was supposed to be non-smoking I could start smelling the smoke an hour or so after I got to the room and ran the air.  Resturant was ok- a little slow on a slow night.

I have no hesitations recommending this hotel.  Although the room we received was not perfect (some wear on carpets and walls), it was impeccably clean.  Our king size bed was quite comfortable, and the bathroom was pretty standard, but also perfectly clean.  The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful, and eager to provide directions to local restaurants and attractions.  Disneyland was only a few minutes away, and mostly non-highway driving.  The free parking garage was convenient as well, but our room was near the exit.
