Part of it was the fault of my sales team and I, but the innkeeper was still rude and very unprofessional. We had a convention nearby, with some teammates coming in from NorCal; we all had lots of last minute changes (some beyond our control).  Anyway, I genuinely booked the room for myself, but the innkeeper unnecessarily pried 5 times while checking in if I was staying by myself (I have a spinal injury and a workers' comp case pending the day after, and intended to use the 2nd bed for sorting papers while killing time since I was the only one that was local), then I was put into a room near the front desk seemingly on purpose.  Afterwards, my teammate's credit card was declined when",January 2019,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,445
104 helpful votes,165 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Serviceable,"We needed an inexpensive place to stay while attending a memorial service in Long Beach. Our previous favorite place has closed down, so I considered several motels in this area. The Moonlight served our needs. A decemt size room, an old (but comfortable enough) bed, a fridge & microwave gave us all we needed. Check in was fine. The Moonlight has a laundry room, which was a nice touch, since we has been traveling for several days. The area is congested, so you'd think it would be noisy, but that was not our experience. Wifi is good. The bathtub floor is a bit slick, so showering was an adventure. I might bring a rubber mat next time. All in all, we got our money's worth and will probably return.",May 2018,"All rooms face south but have good blackout curtains.

We found ourselves having no need to be in the Anaheim area and the deadline to cancel and get a refund had passed. Knowing I had forfeited my money for the late cancellation I called the motel to let Danny know he could rent the room to someone else. After all, why let it go to waste on Thanksgiving or any day. He politely told me he would give me my money back anyhow. I have stayed at this motel some years ago. It is always well kept with a very courteous staff. I would highly recommend this motel to anyone and yes, it is very close to Knott's Berry Farm, Disney Land and the beach.

Upon arrival the owner told us about what there was to do close by.

The place is a bargain hotel, and clearly you get what you pay for. But the desk clerk was super friendly, and the facilities were clean and functional.

The owner was very friendly and helpful on check in...is the place dated...yes, could it use some upgrades...yes, was it comfortable...yes and quiet too.  For a place to lay our heads after a long evening we were happy here.  The pool is very small and needs cleaning and improvements.

75 helpful votes,43 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good value for your money when visiting Disneyland,"I'm not comparing this motel/inn to a Hilton or the Disney Grand Californian.  For the money you got a basic good value including a comfy/clean bed with enough pillows, a working air-conditioner, a flat screen tv, free wifi, a clean/basic bathroom with a show/tub combo, a mini-fridge, a microwave, and a small pool.  The pool lacked ambiance as it was surrounded by an iron bar/gate across from the parking area, but it was still a way to cool off on a hot day.  After all, we weren't staying in the room for long.  We planned to be at the park all day until it closed.  We just needed an inexpensive, quiet place to sleep and it was quiet.  This motel works best if you have a car and you will need to drive to the park as it's not really within walking distance and there are no more",July 2015,An inexpensive place to lay your head when spending most of your day at Disneyland,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,8,445

The microwave was dirty and old. The ironing board was dirty and stained. Luckily I brought my own pillows, a couple small blankets to lay on top of the bed and my own blanket to cover me. It's too far from Disneyland, so if you can't book a room closer, stay away from all the hotels on Beach Blvd where Motel Moonlight is located...cause it's gross. I didn't even get charged a tax.
