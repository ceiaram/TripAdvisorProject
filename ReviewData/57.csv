Make sure you ask to see a room before checking in.  We had two chairs that must have been confiscated from the front porch of some fraternity.  In fact I'm not sure they would accept chairs in this condition.  See Photos.  The smoke or fire alarms had evidently been changed as the old one was still hanging on the wall with wires protruding.  See Photo.  There is no way to get any outside air into your room as the windows will not open.  The general smell of the room was not one of cleanliness but a musty damp type of smell.
