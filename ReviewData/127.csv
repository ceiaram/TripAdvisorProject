The heating system in my room wasn't working.  It was at 64 degrees, when the outside temperature was in the mid 50's.  It was not acceptable to be that cold in the room.   The front desk showed no interest in following up. The front desk person should have reassigned the room when I reported the problem. However, he did nothing but told me to see if the system had reset after I had reported it, gone out for a bit, and then came back.  He was supposed to check on the problem while I was out.

Colin, specifically, the front desk person should NOR be speaking to guests. When I called the front desk from my room asking for more pillows and blankets. Why? Because there were 4 people in the room, and the sofa bed is not the most comfortable. Colin answers the phone and said in an unfriendly tone: ""Let me see what I can do."". That is not the way to talk to a customer. I asked him: ""What do you mean?"". He said: ""Some of the guests may have already taken all of the blankets and pillows."" Well, this is a hotel.

We recently reopened our hotel to guests after a three month closure. As we have begun operations, we have done our very best to implement procedures and amendments to our amenities to keep both our guests and team safe. At this current time, we are not able to safely social-distance our pool and have had to make the difficult decision to remain closed for now. We are following all brand-approved guidelines for our housekeeping and breakfast services to enhance our guests’ comfort and enjoyment as best as possible. We appreciate any feedback we can utilize to enhance our unique Hampton Inn experience. We hope you will give us another chance to make a better impression when our hotel and the rest of the area settle in to a more pleasant “normal”.

And my room had no A/C, and sadly I believe the hotel knew it when they check me in. The A/C didn’t work the night before either (prior guest told me).  I guess the floor fan in the bedroom area should have been my tip off when I settled into the room. And after the hotel re-setting the A/C and it still not working at 8pm, they offered to credit my account with X amount of points – which I accepted. When I checked out the next morning, I found they were crediting me less than ½ of what I was promised. The lady at the front desk said there was nothing she could do.

We picked this hotel based on the close proximity to the San Mateo Campground, where many of our family members were staying, and because we like Hampton Inns.  This hotel did not disappoint.  While the hotel itself is older, it is well maintained and clean.  The suite arrangement worked well with our toddler, as we had more space to spread out and a separate bedroom to put him down for earlier bedtimes.  The only complaint is that the glass door between the bedroom and living room only had a sheer white curtain covering the glass.

They did inform me that if I wanted a room with 2 queen beds they were on the ""street side"".  Since it was me and my son traveling we were ok with 2 double beds.

I am always looking to stay in a hotel that has a separate bedroom (suite) since my kids are so young and still nap during the day.  This was my first time staying at a Hampton. I usually stay at Homewood Suites.  I prefer Homewood, but this Hampton was clean and the staff was very friendly.  The room was clean and the beds were not as comfortable as I hoped (we had two double beds).  But, the staff was great and the breakfast is so convenient when you're traveling with two small children.  What I appreciate is the variety of items for breakfast: waffles, yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, eggs...tons of stuff!  This is not your continental breakfast.
