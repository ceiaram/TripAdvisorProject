Unfortunately the Global Pandemic interfered with those plans. Our last rooms renovation was in 2013. Also due to the pandemic, our state is not allowed to have indoor dining. Our website does advertise that some amenities may not be available. As the mandates are always changing, we have a generic statement there and follow the mandates here on property as they change. Fortunately we are currently allowed to have our pool open. Our rates do reflect the fact that we do not have all of our amenities available.

The confusing part about the courtyards is that their rate changes depending on the day you stay there - ranging anywhere from $129.00 to $179.00 and when they consider a peak time. Also, at most of the courtyards in California you have to pay per vehicle to park. At this courtyard it is $10 which is ridiculous, but be prepared to add that to your bill as well as city and room taxes. It is obvious that the courtyard owns this property (they’re not leasing it) and it is in the middle of an industrial area, not a prime area for parking.

That was great, but I went to close the curtains and the sheer was all frayed, and the blackout curtain behind it had tomato sauce finger prints on it (pizza, anyone?) I looked out the window and the screen was all blotchy and dirty.  We left via a side door when going to dinner, and couldn't help but notice that the tile floor was dirty all along the walls. Bleh. Couldn't help but think after all that, that the place wasn't very clean. Definitely won't stay here again.",November 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,179,229

In the morning the server taking care of the breakfast area was very friendly and cheerful.  The breakfast buffet ($12.95) was decent, tasted fine, although nothing overly adventurous or out of the ordinary (scrambled eggs, bacon (done nicely to my liking), sausage (not too greasy which is good), yogurt, fruit, coffee, cereal, toast, bagels, all typical things).  In-room coffee and the coffee at the breakfast area were good as well.  Our room was clean and well laid out and ample size.  Bathroom counter space a little tight though w/the coffeemaker on it (they maybe should stick that on the desk or something in the main bedroom).

19 helpful votes,10 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice except for thin walls.,"My husband and I stayed here for one night in December 2007 while attending a concert at the nearby Galaxy Theatre. It's convenient to the 405 Fwy. Nice hotel but I found the room (king with a sleeper sofa) on the small side, although it was otherwise comfortable. Also we could hear quite a bit of noise from the hall and neighboring rooms. No mini fridge but I think that's typical for Courtyards. No free continental breakfast: they have a buffet breakfast which was good but expensive (almost $11.00). There's a small concession area near the front desk where you can buy snacks and even beer. I saw two fast food restaurants within walking distance but other restaurants require a short drive or a longer walk. Staff were polite, the grounds were clean.

Each day of my 5-night stay, I observed grounds staff engaged in a variety of tasks.  There is ample parking available on three sides of the property.  The location of the Courtyard Inn is central to various shopping and dining locations, as well as the airport.  It is essential to have a car, however, as it can be several blocks to a couple of miles to any shopping or dining. In addition, there is no shuttle for the airport, requiring an $18 cab fare each way.  The staff at the hotel were great. Check-in personnel were helpful and friendly.

Checkin at 5pm, few cars in the lot.  The clerk was fast and gave me a choice of four floors, which to me seems unusual for a priceline stay.

I have nothing but good things to say about the staff and the room.  The room was spacious, the beds comfortable, and the staff was friendly and accomodating.

41 helpful votes,31 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice Original Courtyard,"This particular Courtyard is one of the older, original prototype designed ones with the outdoor pool in the center courtyard along with a partially enclosed jacuzzi. I had not been to the hotel in several years and found it in very nice shape with what looked like a recent remodel.  For being at least 15 years old, the hotel looks sparkling.  Rooms, hallways and grounds were all perfect.  The only downsides here are that the rooms are very small, say, compared to a similarly priced Hilton Garden Inn, and the location is not exactly perfect.  There's nowhere to walk to - you're pretty much trapped at the hotel unless you want to get in the car.
