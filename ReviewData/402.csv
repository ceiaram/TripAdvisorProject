We tried to air it out but that didn't help. I think the cottages need some serious overhaul. When it is stated that ""the cottages capture the original charm"", to me it seemed that they were just old buildings with old furniture.

From the beautiful flowers that greet you when you arrive in the courtyard  (there were even fresh flowers on one of the tables inside) to the tasteful furnishings inside which were reminiscent of days gone by, everything was a delight to the senses.  The only reason I did't give 5 stars was that the entrance steps from parking were a little challenging with two large suitcases.

Sometimes, even though you do all that you can to make your guests happy, it is not to be. It is very hard to help someone with real as well as perceived issues when you are only told of them after they leave, which gives you no chance to assuage heated emotions and to try and solve any kind of issue.  I tried to talk to her when she got home, but that was a wasted effort. The real problem lies in the fact that even after this guest called me prior to booking the cottage, and was told that we do not have air conditioning, but do have 2 ceiling fans and some floor fans, and even after admitting that she was on the fence about coming because of that, shortly after the call she booked anyway. I cannot control the weather, and wouldn't you know...we had a heat wave, and yes...it was humid.  However, there were 8 other guests on the property that weekend who said that they were not miserable and that the fans were adequate. As far as the intermittent cable/WiFi is concerned, I can't try to fix what I don't know about, and if the cable provider was experiencing trouble with their service, at this point I will never know. It is working perfectly, and has been since she left. This guest also said in another email sent directly to me that she was scared because no one was on the property but her, and that the cottage wasn't safe.  As I stated above, she was hardly alone, every door and window locks securely, and we have never experienced any kind of intrusion. This and many other things she stated in that email and in this review are simply false.   In our almost 16 years in business, it has been imperative to work from the premise that this is #! a People business, and I have worked very hard to go the extra mile to make all of our guests happy for 7 of those years. (This guest is only the second one since 2011 where all efforts have failed.)  Nonetheless, this is why we have a very high rate of return guests, and all those five star ""excellent"" reviews.

Nowhere on our website do we indicate that we have air-conditioning, nor do we show it on the list of amenities on any of the third party travel sites.  Our welcome letter which is sent a few days prior to arrival has a link to the weather forecast for Laguna Beach, so there should be no surprises there.   Finally, the guest did in fact receive a full refund.  Since we didn't promise air conditioning it's hard to argue that we deprived her of a that service.

This particular guest reserved the studio apartment for August 2009. This historic property was built in 1927 and as a seaside village, air conditioning was not a necessity.   August 2009  was warm and while we do supply fans in each cottage and apartment, this guest was not happy.  We wanted to ensure her comfort for her visit to Laguna Beach so we assisted in finding alternate accommodations and issued a credit, which is against normal policy.  We certainly hope this guest will visit Laguna Beach and Manzanita  Cottages again.  Sent: 01 August 2009  Subject: Manzanita Cottages of Laguna Beach  We hope you had an enjoyable time in Laguna Beach. We are sorry you chose not to stay with us, but do hope you will be back in the future to experience a cottage.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Current property manager is a problem,"My husband and I have stayed at the cottages multiple times.  Last year's reservation was a nightmare, finding out only a few days before we'd been moved to the yellow cottage.  Not what we booked.  This year we booked in February for our August trip.  Just days after we paid our deposit we were informed by the property manager she ""forgot"" about another reservation and the blue cottage wasn't available for one of the 14 nights we booked.  It was the last straw for us, reminiscent of what'd we'd been through the year before.  Emails unanswered and issues throughout the summer attempting to get us to spend one night here and move, etc.  We are sad to say goodbye to our favorite BEAUTIFUL Laguna vacation spot.  The integrity issues were just too much to deal with.  One last thing",August 2009,none,none,"I am the owner of Manzanita Cottages and am deeply sorry for this and other negative reviews.
