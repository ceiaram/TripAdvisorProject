none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A nice comfort with my lovey while on a budget,If your looking to stay somewhere that you’ll be left alone and want no one to bug you I prefer and recommend the harbor bay off harbor Blvd in Costa Mesa. My girlfriend and I truly believe this hidden gem in the heart of Costa Mesa does not deserve as bad of a reputation it receives. The owner is such a sweet person and the employees here all work hard to ensure guest are safe and have a comfortable stay. You can tell they really care about this place. We recommend this place for anyone just getting to know Costa Mesa and trying to save some money. It’s worth it.,October 2021,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,446
11 helpful votes,5 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,worst motel,Motel staff all needs to be replaced or the motel shut down completely. The motel has a rampant drug and prostitution issue. They enforce policies that their own employees don't even follow. The owner is the only good thing about this place as she is a sweet lady just doesn't have control over her staff. The motel even goes as far as offering discounts for good reviews.,March 2019,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,446
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,biggest regret of my life...,"My family and I visited Harbor Bay because we needed a place to stay and at first it seemed like a pretty decent place. There was a vending machine, the street looked pretty clean and the place when we first got there was pretty quite as well. We  should’ve known from our first encounter with a crackhead that it was not a safe place. When we first entered the room everything seemed normal we  turned the AC on, it was loud and made strange noises and besides that it would start smelling like something was burning. Then there was the small fridge, we kept some food in there and after a while it started leaking because it didn’t work and the freezer part of it was broken. Another thing was the microwave wouldn’t even heat up food and the tray you’re supposed to put your food on",September 2019,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,446

Let me describe my recent nightmarish experience at this place.  Pulled in after 27 hours of flying and the front office staff was friendly enough.  Asked me if I smoked, to which I said ""no"".  He said not to worry, we keep our rooms pretty clean and tidy.  A warning bell should have gone off when he ran down the ""house rules"" to me, repeating particular rules.  I can't remember the entire list of rules, but he made sure he emphasized that ""there were no guests after 10pm and no extra guests in the room without registering with the office and paying a ""room fee"""".  So I get my key and head out, and straight away outside the office door this guy who was obviously an absolute",October 2017,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,446

And yet I still stayed. PRO: In room reading is provided. CON: The crayon scribble on the wall and the gang writing carved into the nightstand was hard to decipher.   PRO: The A/C works CON: It works best to cancel out the neighbors noise.  If you happen to bring your own microwave on vacation, you won't confuse yours with the one in the room since they spray paint the motel name on theirs.

This is an inexpensive, family run motel just far enough away from Newport Beach that it is affordable.  It does have quite a few permanent residents, welfare families on assistance, some with mental health issues... but it was safe, and I spent 2 entire months here, separated by the mandatory one-day check-out, during which I went up to Hollywood for Hanukkah and Xmas.  Was thinking of visiting again this Winter, but the on-line rate seemed to have gone up, and I didn't bother calling, as I'm going back to Europe where I enjoy visiting more.  I drove then, and getting to McDonald's and Albertsons, and Fry's was pretty simple.  I would walk to the excellent movie theater.
