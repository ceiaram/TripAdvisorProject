none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't Have High Expectations,"We stayed here for a Disneyland trip and chose this place because the pictures looked decent, was close to the park, and had free breakfast. When we got there, the place was so run down and the room was not as expected. The floors were dirty, there were stains on our towels, the towels were so hard and felt like sandpaper on our bodies. Their ""free Internet"" didn't even work and the continental breakfast was a joke. There were only three or four things to choose from.

I feel like the service here has gone WAY DOWN.   Saturday morning, 2/11/23, I was taking a shower before heading to the parks and while I was trying to move the shower curtain to the end because it kept sliding to the middle and getting the floor wet, the rod finally came crashing down on me and hit me on the head while i was in the shower.  I screamed and struggled not to slip and not to have the rod fall and hit my fit while the shower is still going.  My husband tried to set it back up but there was nothing really holding the shower rod in place at all (no screw or anything).

Rooms in East building were nice and spacious. Convenience store next to property.  Fridge and microwave worked well. Working AC.  Negatives: Rooms in West building were very musty/smelly. Internet was horrible, super slow when it works, drops constantly, sometimes for up to an hour, almost unusable. Breakfast is just carbs/sugar/fat, disappointing.  Pool had a lot of dirt on bottom. Low parking on East side. Pillows were flat. Management ignored email. On site laundry required 2 drying cycles meaning a single load cost $12.

Even though we were fairly close to the Disney parks, we had to drive to park (for a $30 fee). A shuttle would have been nice. The website said there was a free breakfast provided. The first morning we went to the lobby to get our ""free breakfast"" and were shocked! Their idea of breakfast was a kids juice box. a bag of prepackaged mini-muffins, a bag of cheese crackers and a granola bar! We had to drive to get breakfast because there was nowhere within walking distance. Our grandkids were with us and we noticed their feet were all dirty on the bottom.

Disneyland is open until midnight. The free breakfast is available at 7 am. We left the hotel at 6:30, as any Disney “expert” knows, gets you to the front of the lines when the park opens.

The coffee and breakfast selection was also pretty bad. They also advertise they are .06 miles from Disneyland but that does not mean how long it takes to walk there.

The walk to the trams to Disneyland was way further than they suggested! The Mickey and Friends parking garage is a block away on the map but the sidewalks are blocked for pedestrians to walk into it so we had to walk all around the other side of the garage. Took us 20-30 minutes to walk there so we took a Lyft back to the hotel at the end of the day.  I usually stay at 4 star hotel but since it was so last minute we just needed an affordable place with a bed and bathroom and this place was a great choice.

The Desk Staff Member stated it was company policy that we could not check in.  We found that odd because in the past this was not a problem.  So, we left and went to lunch and used money we didn't want to spend.  When we came back and checked in we got into our room it was to our liking.

This hotel was a pretty good for it's age and it's price.  The room was clean, it had a fridge and micorwave which was great for the evening.  The service was good. Check in was great.  The pool was cold but great for day time use.  As another reviewer commented the pool was salty but that was because they use a water softener.  The stars on the ceiling was charming.  It was less than 5 min. away from Dland.  The free breakfast was average but better than most donut and coffee places.  The two greatest thrills were: the stars on the ceiling and being able to see the fireworks from Dland without the crowds.  For the price I paid, I'd stay there",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1140,141

We had a coupon book and went to five other hotels in the area and the Stardust is the only one that honored the discounted rate.  We were very pleased with the Fireworks.  We actually left disneyland the second night so we could catch the show from the hotel--as close to fireworks as you can get, kids loved it!!  The breakfast wasn't so great though.  We ended up going out to breakfast on the second morning, but after spending almost $50.00 for four people and waiting 45 minutes at Dennys we ended up back at the Stardust for breakfast on our last morning.  Not great food but free and it held the kids over until lunch.  The rooms were simple but great for the rate.  Basically we could have paid more money and stayed at a fancier hotel",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1142,141

The bed spreads were stained, there was a red/orange stains on the bathroom walls, mirror and fridge. We did spend the night despite the overwhelming insecticide odor. I complained to the manager and Bestwestern. Neither was much help. We ended up staying at the Sheraton Anaheim which was nice.

My only complaint was that it was very crowded, I think the Hotel was sold out, and we had to wait in line to check in and check out and eat breakfast (30 min wait). One day we didn't want to wait in line for breakfast so we went to the IHOP and ended up waiting an hour and spending $70 for breakfast for 4!

We travel to Disneyland about once a year now, and we have stayed in clean rooms that have also been inexpensive, but this was the first time that we stayed at a hotel that was dirty, and nobody cared enough to do anything about it.  We checked into the room, and by the time, I got the bags into the room, my wife said that the room was dirty, and she was correct. There was white dried, hopefully it was dried icecream on the table and the floor. The fridge had some red liquid that was floating in the bottom of it. I think it may have been meat drippings from some raw meat, but whatever it was I was disgusting. The mirror had makeup on it. It was purely disgusting.

BIG MISTAKE! Our first room was dark and dingy and the sink was clogged. We waited a couple of hours for someone to fix it, then called the office to see what the holdup was and they decided just to move us to another room, so we repacked and moved into a room that was missing the sofabed, so we went back to the 1st room and called the office again, the phone in the 2nd room did not work, and we were brought up a key to a THIRD room.

We got a room at the very back and the corridors were dusty and smelly. The room was neat though and so is the bathroom. But the big disappointment was the breakfast. It said full breakfast and what you get in the addition of continental one (without any fresh fruit) is cold scrambled egg and two piece fried potato. I am not kidding it was just two piece and you get to eat in a old train car which needs lot of renovation to give a flavor of healthy looking eating place at least.  Will never stay here again.

It doesn't have video like the Stovall's Best Western, but we got around that. The Sauna is very warm and the pool nice. It's not gigantic pool, but adequate for the size of the inn. I liked the freebie breakfast in the adjacent railroad cars. Don't expect a menu and a waiter, remember this is complimentary. Found the restaurant and inn staff very friendly. Good a/c. When you turn off the lights and switch on the U/V light for a spell, then turn off the lights, a cut-out moon glows and your whole ceiling glows like the milky-way.

35 helpful votes,3 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Big disappointment,"This hotel looked pretty good over the internet.  However, in reality it's just a small motel bordered by a 3 lane off-ramp and a 7 lane road.  The windows are very cheap so the noise level is high.  The pool is small, plain, and in the middle of the parking lot.  The breakfast is served in two dimly-light, dingy, depressing old trolley cars.  It's quite a hike to Disney.  There are no restaurants nearby.  We stayed one night of our 5-night planned stay and moved to Howard Johnson's on Harbor Blvd. at a substantial daily savings on the room rate.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1152,141

I must say it was the one low point in our trip. The rooms are old and run down though fairly clean. Lots of patched walls and older looking fixtures, not to mention we did not feel very safe. The breakfast that everyone raves about-we could barely eat-very greasy and processed no fresh fruit. The last two days we skipped it and went to I Hop. The staff was nice enough and we did have the pool to ourselves which was relaxing. In the future I would rather pay a little more and stay at a little nicer place-with or without breakfast.
