none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Helpful staff and manager,"Visiting Disneyland with my family of 3 from 12/26 to 12/28.  I originally booked this hotel for 4 nights,  then cancelled due to the change of plan, and booked the Courtyard 2 miles away.  My GPS still pointed me to this hotel somehow.  A male staff at the front desk checked me in mysteriously without noticing my reservation actually cancelled days before (he even did not check my ID).  I did not find out the fact I checked in the wrong hotel until around 11PM. I went to the front desk asking for help.  A very nice asian looking lady at night shift helped me correct the nights of stay, and call the Courtyard to cancel my reservation, and try to get the no show penalty refunded although without success.    The second day, Manager Sam used his personal connection, and get the",December 2022,none,none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,348

In part, we chose the hotel due to its proximity to Disneyland -- it is only about 25 minutes away (either using the freeway or taking the local road straight from the hotel to Disney's entrance).  The hotel is, apparently, less than two years old and is in excellent condition.  Our room was extremely spacious and comfortable, and very quiet.  The hotel has plenty of parking in a well-lit lot.  Also notable was the friendly staff we encountered both during check-in and at our departure.  Altogether, my family and I were very impressed by the Fairfield Inn in Los Alamitos.",July 2022,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,348

Unfortunately, for a hotel having a check in at 3pm; calling and messaging on the app on our way in to verify checkin going unanswered, to find that our ADA room (my wife has a bad knee, uses a walker, and can't get into a bathtub), to be informed that at 3:15 when we checked in that our room would not be ready for over 30 minutes. When the front desk agent talked with housekeeping (in front of me at the desk), asking if the room was ready was told NO! When she asked her if she could get it ready she raised her voice again NO! and walked away.

I am a Platinum member soon to be a Titanium member with Marriott, and we do travel to all types of hotels (timeshares, Ritz, Courtyards, etc)  I was given a complimentary upgrade in their suite w/a living room.  We stayed 3 nights.  They always greeted us in the hallway, breakfast dining room, etc.   The room was new as it first opened Feb 2021.  Well laid out.  Parking was included as well as the breakfast which was good.  Everything smelled great and you  can't help but notice the staff wiping down tables and high touch areas.  Special shout out to Sophia and Joselyn.  Close to restaurants.  Close to the 605 fwy.  I really enjoyed my stay and hope this hotel can keep up with the great customer service.

3 helpful votes,3 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,The Details,"Currently, travel is stressful. The fact that this hotel has dedicated a TV channel to their cleaning practices is proof that they acknowledge what their guests are experiencing. I  alone, spent 2 nights here and it was good. I have worked in this industry and I know how difficult it is to get things perfect. This hotel does a lot of things right. However in room 310, the shower door generously leaked water. Every inch of the bath mat was soaking wet along with the floor near the shower, after a 5 minute shower. In addition, the bathroom sink faucet lever was very difficult to turn on and the only position it would work in was at full blast. Not only a tremendous waste of water but water went everywhere, even while trying to be careful.

3 helpful votes,8 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Extra Mile,My family and I enjoyed our 4 nights at this hotel. The hotel common areas and rooms were very clean. No problems with check in/check out. The young attendants at breakfast were very hospitable and  courteous when serving hot bfast sandwiches or stocking up the yogurts and danishes. We felt safe and comfortable with the location. The customer service we received that we very much appreciate is actually after we checked out. My husband forgot a tshirt (and his shorts and undergarments)  he purchased as a souvenir that he was going to wear when we left that morning. He pulled out another set of clothing and didn’t realize he forgot his shirt until we were 13 hours away our half way point til we got home. I called the hotel and asked if they could look for it.

The front desk was very friendly and helpful throughout the trip especially Sam.  The walkability was also amazing, there are so many great restaurants in the area.

Hotel is in good neighborhood and we feel safe during our stay. Our room was automatically upgraded with king sized beds even though we booked for queen beds. We enjoyed the complimentary wi-fi in our room. Complimentary Breakfast was pack-and-go with hot coffee, fruits, yogurt and hot sandwich.

First, every hotel is built with paper thin walls? WHY??? People make noise, some artificial (radios, TVs) some organic (talking, and uh ... well .. other noises). SOUNDPROOF the walls. Our neighbor started playing music at 2:30 AM. Not insanely loud, but certainly loud enough to wake us. We called down to the lobby and it stopped shortly after.  Follow through. I called the hotel to add my wife’s name, and in lieu of the e-check in the person said he would block us into a top floor room (obviously we are light sleepers; we’re older), and sure enough when we arrived we had been put on the third floor.
