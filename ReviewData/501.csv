Disappointing visit,"From Santa Barbara to San Diego; from Santa Monica to Indio, when I visit Southern California, I expect the hotel pool to be open unless the outdoor temperature is below 70F degrees. The hotel's pool was inexplicably closed (no reason given), with an opening date in August. There was no shampoo in the room, and I needed to leave a note for housekeeping twice for the staff to add more. Some thugs woke me up at 1:34am talking and playing loud vulgar music right outside my room. Happily, their stay was brief. My bathroom ceiling leaked for about 10 minutes one evening. Wifi was weak and did not support video. The location is great: barely a 12-minute bus ride to Disneyland; a 90-minute bus ride to John Wayne Airport (2 busses); and a 110-minute bus ride to Newport Beach.

The room was dirty. The restroom was not clean. The front desk guy came up and wiped the restroom. The carpet looks like it hasn’t been cleaned it years. It looks like a couple brothers bought the hotel and are doing the minimum to keep it going. I would never stay there again. I would not recommend this place to anyone. As I am finishing this review I realized why they over booked. (They had someone on the phone when I arrived and said they would save the room for them if they paid cash. I looked on the counter and they had a ledger with what looked like bookings and the cash amount) that is the room they gave me because I had already paid) just my guess.,July 2021,Pay a few extra dollars and stay somewhere nice.,Traveled as a couple,"We're sorry to hear that you didn't enjoy your stay with us, and we apologize for any inconveniences you may have experienced.

I called the front office and they said it would take 30 minutes for someone to come fix it! 30 minutes of constant beeping in the middle of the night?! You've got to be kidding me.
