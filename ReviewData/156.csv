Easy access off 5 (like 100 yards) and next to a  strip mall with goo food places.  But he rooms are spot on.  Plenty of outlets, temperature control is easy, and just everything is in the right place.   I feel safe here:  everything seems to be routinely sanitized.   As much as possible they strive to make the hotel experience good, even in lock-down.,   They just opened their lobby bare (5-9), and it is fantastic.  Michelle is  a fun and cool bartender.   And the guests are great too.  I met the management here too, (Nigel and Amber).   I see where the care for customers comes from.

First off can I just say how amazed I am by her customer service? She was very friendly and professional. Since I’m from Washington I needed assistance with finding places to eat and stores nearby for groceries, she went out of her way to check what’s open and to even call to see if the restaurant were doing dine in.

128 helpful votes,96 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,New Property...working out kinks?,Hotel is in an area of a lot of brand new hotel construction.  Not a fan of the dual-branded concept here.  The same building houses a Homewood Suites.  I stayed at a similar type property in Denver and it was confusing as is this one.   There is a separate Homewood Suites lounge that all Hampton Inn guests pass by...does that mean I can or can’t use it?    They are diluting their brand.    Also are they breakfasts/other amenities the same? No idea.  The room was fairly comfortable...bed was nice and room was clean and quiet.  There was a big service issue though.  Twice I came in and the front desk wasn’t attended.  One time there were multiple people waiting for at least 5 minutes.  There was someone sitting in the lounge who then got up and started attending to guests after,August 2020,none,none,"Hello Miamilocal1,  Thank you for taking the time to write your feedback on your recent stay at our dual property. First, I would like to apologize about the confusion of both brands. At the moment due to COVID-19, we do have minimal amenities open to ensure we are practicing social distancing. Secondly, as soon as everything operates normally everything will be secluded by brands but as of right now we have it open for everyone!
