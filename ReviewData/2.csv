Our experience was a bit mixed.  On the plus side, the room was clean and spacious.  The location can’t be beat.  You are about a 5-minute walk from the parks.  On the negative side, only one elevator was operational, we heard outside noise frequently, the bathroom was very cramped, the hot water was not working at the entire hotel for a good part of one day, and we never had our sheets changed despite calling to request that be done.

Only reason I did not give a 5 star review is because our room was located on the bottom floor in the back corner, so it was pretty dark and the window was facing a brick wall, and there was an issue with drainage in the shower.

Check in was smooth and parking was easy. However, the management and security does a very poor job of dealing with loud and obnoxious guests.  At 10pm and all hours of the night my young kids, husband and I were awoken by our neighbors who had their door wide open and were yelling and making loud noises.  We had to call the front desk twice before anyone came and even then the hotel security did basically nothing.  We had a horrible night sleep and all ended up getting sick after.

I can understand appreciating it for what it is, but not *loving* it. We are passholders living out of state so we come down a lot and always need a hotel.

However, the entire place is completely run down. The room had awful glaring EXTREME fluorescent lighting--my teenagers called them murder lights because it really looked like the atmosphere for a horror movie.

Long story short, I wasn't going to make the reservation due to the flight situation (which was out of my control) and yet the hotel refused to reimburse the first night stay because I cancelled the day of my reservation.

We found two cockroaches in the bathroom over a period of a couple of days. When reported to the front desk, they offered to send someone to kill it but my Husband had already done that. No offer for compensation unfortunately. No continental breakfast (which we already knew about when we booked). Pool is quite small. Bathroom had very little ventilation.

(Newer rooms are in the main building).   For months I had researched which of the hotels to stay at after deciding I didn't want to stay at Anaheim Desert Inn & Suites again, even though I did like it last time I was there, but wanted an upgrade with my bed, so for the price I was looking for to spend, I found Grand Legacy at the Park.  Some of the reviews that went on about how loud the music was on top of the building at night, had me worried. But after seeing some reviews say they didn't hear the music on the lower floors, I decided to take a chance on Grand Legacy, but made sure to request a lower floor room and thankfully I got what I requested and I heard",July 2022,none,none,"Hey AngieJ72  On behalf of our entire staff, we would like to thank you for your kind words and hope to see you again when your travels bring you back to the area.

Pros: • Excellent location--a block from the light where the Disneyland Esplanade begins, only a handful of hotels are closer to the park • Great customer service on the phone and via email • Luxury 2  queen bed room in the new tower was clean with a good view of California Adventure • Our room location (259) was perfect, right above ""Anytime Hawaiian"" so the night before we went to Disneyland we bought a bunch of spam musubi, refrigerated it, then brought in foil to the park the next day so it was the perfect temperature and we got to avoid the long food lines.

The hotel itself is average.  A bit old despite the new renovations.  AC/heater wall units can be very loud.  Breakfast is free but only offers the basics like muffins, hard boiled eggs (which go fast), cereal, and coffee.    Biggest complaint is the parking.  There just isn't enough parking spaces.  If you come back to the hotel in the evening, it's difficult to find parking.  Hence, despite the great location, I avoid staying here due to the parking.

Peeling paint around the mirror could do for a touch up as well. Keep in mind that it also is a busy hotel and sound will travel - it’s expected, at least in my opinion.

Not much to say about it really except that it’s close to Disneyland so who really cares about the room itself. If your spending any time in it you’re doing it wrong. But the real highlight of the place is Hoang! The dude is the valet and he’s an absolute lifesaver. We got it on a very early flight and booked it to the hotel to try to get into the park at opening. Hoang was super helpful immediately. Helped us with bag check and was really patient as we fumbled through our things trying to get from travel to park mode. But the next day he went over the top with the customer service. My phone charger wasn’t working. Hoang got one out of his own car and gave it to me for free. The dude is dope.

So was very disappointed in this. The room was tiny for a family of 4.  We ended up buying an airbed for our daughter as the girls kept each other awake.

You have to pay extra to park your car at the motel or you can pay even more for valet parking. The problem is that if you are lucky enough to find a parkibg space, the valet double parks their cars in front of the other cars that are already parked in valid parking spaces.
