It was, by far, the worst hotel experience I have had.  How bad? I decided to cut my stay short and moved to another hotel.

The “guest laundry service” consists of 3 sets of very old beat up machines which I wouldn’t even use for a college dorm. 1 of each washer and dryer did not work. To get change and detergent you have to take the elevator down to the first floor from the 12th. One of the working dryers made a very loud banging sound as it rotated. Felt sorry for the people on that floor! The “suite” did not have a microwave; this also requires a trip to the twelfth floor. Lighting in the rooms is dimm.  I did enjoy a fantastic salad and glass of wine in the restaurant. The server Liz (I think) was very helpful and personable.

The suite I chose is 2 double beds and outside there is a sofa bed. 2 smart televisions which I really like. check in was super convenient. Room service is good too. Some tips for 1st time visitors  Internet is not free. You have to be a Marriotte club member to get it free. If you are here to visit Disneyland, parking in Disneyland is fir 20 dollars and a shuttle service takes you to the park . That took too long. The other option is the hotel shuttle which comes every 1/2  hour, 6 dollars for adults and 3 dollars for kids. I tried both and found the shuttle more convenient.

The service was like that of a 5 star hotel; every staff member we encountered was competent, helpful and friendly.

The TVs are great - they have access to cable, Netflix and Hulu, and can even connect to Bluetooth. I've stayed at fancier/newer hotels with way dumber TVs. Our typical go to is the Hyatt Regency since it's a bit fancier, but I think this may have edged out the Regency due to the exceptional service and better price.

Parking was plentiful and is found behind the hotel.  At time of this review, it costs $15/day for self-park and $20 for valet.

Consider dropping off items/people at the front entry before heading back.  Check in was quick and painless.  The front desk clerk was friendly and courteous.

We didn't want to stay in the city of Los Angeles we wanted to stay somewhere with easy access to Disney. We chose this hotel as it was close to Disney and had good reviews. The reception staff were very helpful and pleasant and it had a handy Starbucks in reception. Breakfast wasn't included in the rate however we had a variety of options within minutes of the hotel. There was plenty of car parking at the hotel at a cost of $15 per night which is average for the area.

Guests’ banks then release the credit hold in about 3-5 business days, so using a debit card will in effect tie up the dollar amount from your bank balance.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1556,69

It met our needs but definitely did not exceed our expectations.  The hotel is reasonably priced and our rate included a phenomenal breakfast which our children loved.  This Hotel is NOT within walking distance of Disneyland.  There is a bus outside of the hotel which comes every 30 minutes and will take you to Disneyland.  The next time we travel to Disneyland we will definitely book a property closer to the Disneyland Resort so that we can go back to the hotel for a rest part way through the day.

This hotel is located at the corner of Harbor Blvd/Chapman Ave.     A little down the road from the hustle and bustle of the Resort Hotels, but when we stayed this past weekend, the rooms were not as expensive and if you are a Marriott Rewards member, it falls within the Catagory level to stay on a certificate and or points without breaking the bank.

I would like to address each of your concerns in the order you shared.  Hopefully, you were able to share these issues with our team during your stay to allow us an opportunity to make it right for you and your family.  Marriott Rewards:  You are correct, it is a standard that we recognize our Marriott Rewards Members and for this to not have happened is not acceptable.  I have brought this to the attention of our Front Desk Manager and our Front Desk team.  Offering upgraded suites is based on availability of that particular suite type.  There are times when we are sold out of our larger suite types and not sold out of our smaller suite type, therefore, not making it possible to upgrade.  Your particular situation has definitely been shared and discussed with our team.  Reservation: I have used your review as an example to illustrate how necessary it is to read the special requests of those guests arriving and preparing for their arrival.  Location:  Thank you for sharing how convenient our location is to local restaurants and shopping, which is great for families traveling to the area.  We also one of few hotels that offers an on property Disney Desk, which is operated by an actual Disney Cast Member.  Our guests get exclusive access to this Disney Cast Member!  They can make reservations for Disney Restaurants, ask questions about park schedules… you name it!  Front Desk Service:  We are taking proactive daily steps to ensure we provide excellent guest service overall and that we are constantly learning how to tend to the needs of our guests.  Breakfast Food & Service:  In August 2011, we added many upgraded options to our Breakfast Buffet accommodating those that may be vegetarian as well!  These items are changed daily but we are more than happy to accommodate special requests, if we are made aware.  We would be delighted to do so!  Such items now include, Eggs Benedict, more variety of breakfast meats (bacon, turkey sausage, veggie patty), Tahitian Vanilla French Toast with caramelized bananas, waffle station, various omelets and much more!  Housekeeping:  I am very sorry to hear that the problem was not resolved after you brought this to the attention of our Housekeeping Department.  Hopefully you were able to share this with the Front Desk so that we would’ve been able to offer the option of changing rooms.

First off, the room is shaped very funny, it runs lengthwise instead of being wide, which makes the living room area very narrow and small.  The bedroom is big and seperated by french doors and the beds are very comfortable  The location of the bathroom sink is very bad. The sink is separated from the bathroom by a door so you have to enter the bedroom to use the sink, and it is open onto the bedroom area, so if anyone is asleep in there, you are sure to wake them.
