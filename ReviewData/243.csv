I was upgraded to a king bedroom on the top floor and the room was very quiet – especially given that the hotel is an open atrium from the lobby to the top floor (7th floor is top).  The bed was very comfortable and everything was new.  The Wi-Fi was quick and reliable.  The bathroom was large with good sized shower, but there was no towel rack or hook to hang your towel after use.  The breakfast buffet had a good assortment of hot and cold items and the service was very good.  On my second day I came back from working all day around 4pm and my room still hadn’t been made.  There was also a plate of uneaten fruit that had been given to me as a",June 2018,none,none,"Dear Beth K,  Thank you for choosing to stay with us at the Hyatt Regency John Wayne Airport Newport Beach.

none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Clean & Amazing Rooms! Bathroom was incredible.,"We drove along the coast to San Francisco and stopped here. We loved how clean the rooms were and how updated they were. The bathroom was gorgeous along with the room and we felt right at home when we walked in. There was no question we would stay here again on vacation. The only downside was the $25 per person buffet style breakfast, which was outrageous considering we spent a lot on the room itself. For a $250+ hotel room, I would expect a better breakfast option that isn't $50+ for 2 people.",June 2018,none,none,"Dear jquickie23,  Thank you for choosing to stay with us at the Hyatt Regency John Wayne Airport Newport Beach.
