Upon checking to my dismay, the rooms were not connecting and the hotel was sold out with no ability to rectify the problem, other than to offer free parking for my dissatisfaction.

We usually use a Marriott in Irvine but we decided to go closer to the beach and the Marriott seemed like it was going downhill in the recent years. I thought hyatt was a good name and the pics looked like it would be a fun nice place. The rooms are tiny. They are more of a motel style than a hotel. The bathrooms are not private. And they aren’t cleaning rooms daily because of an industry shortage of employees. This is unacceptable. In my husbands business there is a shortage of employees as well but that just means we can take in less business, not that we give in less quality of business. Also we had to pay a resort fee that was insane. Especially for feeling like a motel experience. And we paid $30 a night to park.

The valet lot is more expensive but right next to the property. The self park is about 250 yards of hills and blind corners away from the rooms. There is no established walkway and no street lights.   The rooms are disgusting. There is no sound insulation so you hear everything. There is water damage, exposed wiring, rusted fixtures, front doors that don’t close all the way, showers that scream, and mystery stains everywhere.

I was there for a conference and the rooms were very comfortable. The rooms or at least my room was grimey and the bathroom was pretty gross. The shower head and lever did not work properly so, my husband and I ended up taking high showers with the head on the high pressure setting because it only worked on that setting. The bathtub was clogged and by the second day would not drain at all. There were also stains in the toilet bowl. The bed was ok but I could feel the springs or something lumpy in the middle of the night. The room also smelled like old cigarette smoke. The food was ok, good for hotel food but I would never choose to eat there. The customer service was good but one of the managers was very rude.

The room was pretty small over the bungalows and the people next to us and below us were very loud. The valet boys were very nice, check in clerks were very friendly as well. The $12 tiny glass of wine at the concert was crazy over priced. The next morning breakfast which included two eggs over easy, wheat toast and bacon was $18.

There are 3 beautiful pools. The hotel is low rise with rooms spread in separate buildings around the resort. Hotel services could not have been better.

Upon check in, we were told we were ""upgraded"" to a room. The room we got was nothing close to upgraded it was a regular room that had an old smell. We got to our room, we ordered room service, and they charged us 3$ deliver fee? What is this delivery for? We ordered in house. This is not uberEats! Why is there a delivery fee when its in the complex. It is not like we were given the option to pick up. The next day we had a wedding. My husband was directed into a shuttle for the wrong wedding.

The water pressure was decent and the room was clean so no complaints there. The hotel seemed understaffed in general, especially in the restaurant.  To be clear, the hotel is average, not terrible.

At the 630pm shuttle to fashion island there were probably 100 people waiting for a 15 passanger van. I felt like the hotel didn't plan well enough with 2 conference going on at the same time.

The staff were very friendly and accommodating during our stay and assistance finding local restaurants to explore. Only two concerns regarding our stay. 1.) The quality of the breakfast buffet could be greatly improved. For example, very little fruit options. A handful of berries were sprinkled over the pancakes and French toast each morning. This left the berries dried out and seemed very cheap of the hotel. For this price, additional berries should be left out as a fruit option. 2.)

The hotel character is typical of good quality beach hotels in Southern California. You can't quite put your finger on it, but you feel relaxed when you arrive and step into the lobby area- which is quite the most informal I have experienced.  Rooms are very comfortable, many (as mine) lead into grassy or pool areas via sliding patio doors. Air conditioning is mandatory during the hot season- which is really all year round! The bed is very comfortable- crisp sheets and a mattress topper make your sleep guaranteed and sound- even if you are jet lagged.

For frequent travelers with dietary restrictions, this is a big issue.  For the most part, the hospitality industry has not caught up with dietary concerns, but this Hyatt has.  The hotel itself is lovely.  Built cabana style, it is open and breezy with several pools and beach views.  The rooms are good sized for a single or couple, with a dressing area/bathroom",June 2015,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2488,132

There are no elevators in some of the buildings and basically it kooks like someone took a 1950 california motel and slapped some stucco on it. The building we were in had dirty carpet on the exterior stairs. The riom we were given was musty smelling and bland.

The service was good at check-in but plummeted downward like a plane without engine support after that.  Here are some examples:  I went to the restaurant for breakfast, nobody waited on us as we sat at our table for 30 minutes -- we walked out.  I called the for our car valet, there was no answer.

The hotel’s look in the reality is very far from the pictures on their website. The pictures are very misleading. This hotel has only 2 floors, so there is not much of a view. Room is pretty basic, not as beautiful as shown on the pictures, but remodeled. The bayview is very relative; it’s more of the road and passing cars view, and then something like lagoon very far away. Also only executive suites are in the main building on the first floor. If you are in a bayview room, you will have to walk about 5 min. from the lobby, and this part looks more like motel, old and outdated.  There are 3 pools.

Also, our main building has 3 floors and the suites are located throughout the hotel on various floors.

We do not heat the main pool as it is the largest pool and the other 2 pools are heated. We try to offer a variety of options for our guests to suit as many people as possible. I am also sorry that your breakfast was not up to standard either and I can understand how this can affect the rest of your day.

Also they have complimentary drinks behind the front desk--definitely try those out. Mine was guava and was perfect after a long flight.  Also through the back gates is a nature preserve that stretches on for miles, as well as Newport Dunes. Both are perfect adventures as well as fresh sea air and I heard the cafe at Newport Dunes by the nature preserve is great. Get in a standup paddle rental from the little hut behind the cafe.  $3.49",April 2013,none,none,"We appreciate you taking the time to leave such a wonderful review from your recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Newport Beach. It sounds like you were able to find many of the gems near the hotel such as the beautiful Back Bay and Newport Dunes. Perhaps on your next visit you will want to take our complimentary shuttle to Balboa Island for a fun afternoon out in the sun.  It was also great to hear that you were able to find so many vegetarian options at the Shor American Seafood Grill. Our chefs work hard putting together a menu that will hopefully have options for all types of dietary needs. They are also very considerate of the environment, ensuring that we use only local, sustainable products from our produce down to the fish that we serve.  Hopefully you will have to chance to come back and stay with us again. We are starting our Summer Concert Series on 6/21/13, which runs all through summer and is a great way to spend a warm summer evening in Newport Beach.

We were in town with a lot of family and friends for a wedding that took place at another venue.  We had problems with this hotel from the beginning when we discovered that our rooms were far from the parking/lobby areas and up a flight of stairs with no elevator.  Since we had two guests who use canes and have difficulty with walking and stairs, this was really a problem.  The only other problem with the room, which was generally very nice and overlooked the water, was that the cleaning crew would congregate outside nearby at 6AM in the morning and make a lot of noise.  We also had problem with the parking lot, where the gates never seemed to be functioning right and we had to build in extra time to get out of the lot each",May 2013,none,none,"It was great reading the review you wrote from your recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Newport Beach. We really appreciate you taking the time to let us know how everything went over your 5 day stay, as we will use this information to improve our service. I completely understand your frustration in having to walk a distance to your room and then up stairs knowing there were people with you who had difficulty with the stairs and the distance. As we have 4 separate buildings, depending on which building your room is located you may have a bit of a longer walk. Please always inform our staff upon check-in of any disabilities your party has, so that we can try our best to get you a room that will accommodate everyone. Memorial weekend is a very busy time but I know that our staff will always try their best to ensure you are comfortable with you room. Our housekeeping managers have been informed of the noise complaint from that area, and I can assure you this is not a normal occurrence, however it will be addressed with the staff to ensure it does not come up again.  We do offer complimentary internet in our lobby 24-7. You can take advantage of this while enjoying your morning coffee or having a cocktail in the evening. We also have a business center located in the lobby for guests without a computer to gain access to the internet or print out a boarding pass. As for parking we offer a variety of options for our guests. There are complimentary shuttles that go to and from John Wayne Airport, as well as Fashion Island and Balboa Island. We also have a car rental service onsite as well as comparable valet and self-parking rates. We hope that you will have a chance to come back and hopefully we can show you that we listen to our guests by exceeding your expectations on your next stay.

We stayed in the Lido section, which was farthest away from the lobby and the only pool without a bar....otherwise, the room and bed were great.  The only meals we ate on side were breakfast and it was great....try the chicken sausage!  We rented bikes one morning for $9 and rode down to the water.....great idea if you have some free time.  Water is also within walking distance.",May 2013,none,none,"Hello Lori, it was really great reading your wonderful comments regarding your stay at the Hyatt Regency Newport Beach. It sounds like you had a great idea in taking the bikes down to the beach, I would also recomend a ride around Back Bay. The bay is home to plenty of wildlife, and some of the birds can only be found in this specific area. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed breakfast in our new restaurant SHOR American Seafood Grill. If you are able to visit us again I would highly reccomend having dinner at SHOR. The restaurant proudly offers food options that are good for the guest, good for the community and good for the planet and food from natural, local and sustainable sources.

The grounds were very nice and the renovations they made were great.  My largest complaint is with our room.  We had a double room with a nice view of the bay.  Only a few rooms have a view of the bay which is nice but since they are the only rooms on the road they are somewhat noisy.  The beds in the room are SO small.  My husband and I barely both fit into the same bed.  My largest complaint is with the bathroom doors...sounds silly but it was such an annoying part of our stay.  The new doors they put on the bathroom are more like shutters so every time you go in the bathroom, close the ""doors"" and turn on the lights it is basically like turning on the lights in the whole room.

We're always working opposite hours so its hard to get a weekend away but this was the perfect solution. We actually felt like we were on vacation somewhere tropical!  The hotel was just completing renovations so the larger pool wasn't open, but the pool that our room overlooked was just fine, plus it offered complimentary bed-type loungers.  Our room was very comfortable and newly renovated. The beds were nice and linens were crisp and soft. The bathroom even had great products in it too and there were robes and a safe in the closet. The only thing the room was missing were hooks to hang your used towels.   Even though its in our own backyard, we would gladly enjoy another",April 2013,none,none,"It is so wonderful to hear that you had such a perfect Stay-cation!

48 helpful votes,76 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Property and Great Service!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Regency Newport Beach over Memorial Day Weekend!  We had originally ""applied"" for an upgrade to a suite for an extra fee (so the kids could sleep in a separate room).  Upon arriving, we were told that we got the suite, however when we arrived at the room, the suite was really just an extra board room, with a conference table (meaning the kids would still be in our room).  We called and told them our situation and we're hoping to move to a different suite, but expecting to move back to a regular room.  To our surprise, they upgraded us to another suite with our OWN private pool (not huge, but private - probably 10x16 feet).  The room was great as well, with full kitchenette, living room (pullout sofa for kids) and private bedroom.
