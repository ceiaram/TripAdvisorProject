My kids could watch the evening movie and be more comfortable in the pool than the adults on the deck.  The hot tub was also a nice temperature.  The fitness center was nice but to keep kids out of it a front desk staff person had to let you in each time which could be a hassle when they were busy.  The breakfast had lots of options and the staff busted their tails to serve and bus tables.  It is still a hotel breakfast though.

Especially a bad service and a poor interest to attend and satisfy the needs of the guest. Outside, at the door, you will always find two or three people to greet guests, but ... just that. They do not help you with your luggage, they only lend you their instrument so that you can take the suitcases to your room yourself. Pay attention to this, there is no housekepping service, only if you stay for more than 7 days they will clean the room for you once. There is a pullbed in the room, but don't count on it, the mattress is very thin and you couldn't sleep there. The location is adequate, very close to the attractions, but it is important to note that after 10 P.M. there will be no one to greet you and you can only enter",November 2021,none,none,Thank you very much for providing us with valuable and detailed feedback about your recent experience at Cambria Anaheim.

I pointed out the mask issue when I checked in- also pointing out that their website says they are COVID compliant and they have lots of signs saying you must wear a mask- they said they were “doing their best.” We came to use the pool and spent most of the time watching TV in the room.

But there was a real lack if attention to detail and it was like it was designed by someone who knew nothing about hotels. For example, our suite would sleep 6/7 & there was a large shower & separate bath with additional shower, which was good.  But there was nowhere to hang towels - just one small hook!  And a cupboard to hang a few items of  clothing but no drawers (& doors  of wardrobe very stiff).

For someone traveling solo like me, I was a bit skeptical considering the hotel is so close to Disneyland. However, it is perfect for someone who is visiting strictly for business.

The rooms are spacious and very tasteful (the subtle shimmer in the wallpaper of the rooms and hallways are absolutely gorgeous) and plenty of plug-ins everywhere to charge my technologies.
