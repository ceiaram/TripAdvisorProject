I got a great weekend rate, so I selected them despite this, but I am staying at Courtyards much less these days because of it--and I usually have about 100 hotel nights per year, so 'less' means dozens of stays elsewhere as a result of no coffee.

Very clean hotel with a friendly staff. Spacious lobby with a huge TV that had the Olympics on when we arrived.

The hotel is part of a business park, but there's also a Starbucks, Wahoo's and a pizza place within walking distance. The only bummer is that it requires a slight detour off the I-5.

It just makes me wonder how often they do maintenance.   Also something else that I noticed was that they didn't have cookies at the front desk like many Courtyards do in the evenings.
