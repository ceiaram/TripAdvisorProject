The staff is always courteous and the hotel is clean and top notch. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 rating is that they started charging for $12 parking. I'm sure its the property owners who made them do it just to scratch more money from the consumers and the various people who leave their vehicles in the property without being checked into the hotel. It sucks for the hotel guests who stay here multiple days to have to pay for the $12 when its a ""Park at your own risk"" policy. If we have to pay for parking then our cars should be protected.

40 helpful votes,35 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice bargain hotel,I recently stayed at this hotel for a business trip.  The hotel is about 7 miles from SNA and depending on traffic about 10 minutes away. The hotel is only a year or two old and in good shape.  The room configuration is nice with two flat screen TVs (one in sleeping area and the other near the work desk). There is a small fridge and microwave in the room. The breakfast provided by the hotel has a number of options and the sitting area is well laid out so you aren't jammed on top of each other.  The staff are very friendly. My only complaint is that the desk area doesn't have a work light for reading documents and other tasks. The nearest light is by the couch on the other wall which doesn't provide much illumination for working at the desk.,February 2016,none,none,Thank you for staying and sharing such positive feedback!

But this hotel was pleasantly above all the others as it, I later learned, was only a year old. You could have fooled me, as the room was immaculate and appeared to have never been used. Another surprise was the enclosed glass shower, which was spotless and again appeared to have never been used. THE ENTIRE ROOM WAS SPOTLESS! As far as traffic noise was concerned, we experienced none. Our encounter with staff was limited, as we checked in late after attending a wedding, but the night clerk appeared friendly enough.

We had the two bed Suite which was nice in that it had a seating area with a sofa and two TV's. There was also a work desk and a small partial divider wall. The breakfast was very good with Oatmeal, Scrambled Eggs, Sausage, Yogurt, Milk/Juices, Cereals, various breads, either Cantelope or Bananas. The only complaint I have is that they never change things up with the breakfast. It is virtually the same thing day after day. The other issue I saw here was that they NEVER vacuum the hallways or stairways. There was the same clump of dirt on the stairway the whole five days I stayed there. If you look closely at the hallway carpets, there is tiny pieces of lint/dirt/garbage all over. The",December 2013,none,none,"Thank you for staying with us and sharing your comments!

We didn't get to the property until about 9 pm.  The service was friendly and efficient.  My husband had a business meeting in Tustin early the next morning, so the location was ideal.  It was situated next to the off-ramp and the highway, but the room was pretty quiet -- just a low hum.    Some Fairfields are pretty dumpy and are on par with a Motel 6 -- not so with these new-styled Fairfields.  Everything looked modern and had ample space for working (desk, computer hook ups, microwave, small frig).

I travel regularly to Orange County for business and at times it's very difficult to find a good quality and affordable hotel in the area.

They decided on the Fairfield Inn where we visited several times during their stay and I must admit I was impressed.

She was knowledgeable of the local area and even gave us a turn by turn direction to the nearby coffee bean. Also this property had the consistent look of a marriott hotel with 5 star guest services.
