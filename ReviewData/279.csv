I liked it, the beds were comfy, the breakfast was adequate and the front desk staff were friendly- unfortunately I won't get to do that this year because they've priced themselves out of the market.  I travel weekly to this area and now the only place that is priced where I can stay is the Marriott Courtyard.  This hotel will be losing at least the other 3 consultants that work with me as we all have to switch allegiances because HGI seems to think they can be priced $60 higher than their direct competitor. The beds are nice- but they are not $60 bucks nicer....",November 2011,none,none,Thank you for your valuable input.

The hotel is standard for Hilton Garden, which is my preferred chain for business trips.  Since the hotel was busy, I was only able to book a double room.  I prefer a king bed and was pleasantly surprised that the desk clerk was able to find one for me.  It was an accessible room that was fine unless you need a bath tub.  My only complaint about the room was that the walk in shower didn't have a soap dish.  This doesn't make much sense as I'm pretty sure disabilities don't eliminate the need for bath soap.  I'm Hhonors gold so my breakfast was included.  The first morning, it was a little busy and somewhat disorganized.  After that, it was fine.

Do not go expecting a luxury property; it is a typical Hilton Garden Inn.  But the place is evidently well managed, clean and efficient.  The bed is not fitted with luxurious linens, but it is comfortable and the room is pleasant and not run down.  There is a little traffic noise from the nearby toll road, but it is not bothersome.  The bathroom is clean and there is plenty of evenly hot water.  The staff was cheerful and efficient.  There is ample free parking.  I didn't try the restaurant or other amenities.

The property is a newish typical Hilton Garden Inn with all of the HGI amenities including a microwave and small fridge in the room.

Bathroom was very small and the vent fan did not work properly. Staff was told but nothing was done. In the morning they had a breakfast for guests in the lobby but wanted over $12. Way overpriced so we went to a Denny's close by. They had coffee but not even a donut or cookie. They wanted you to buy their breakfast. Swimming pool was very small and not very inviting. We did not use it. Location was good and area was quiet. The beds were nice and we did sleep well.  I might stay here again if I was by myself but I would not bring my wife here.
