With $45 parking charge and a resort fee tacked-on, the property just isn’t nice enough to charge those high levels of prices. The ocean view is nice but certainly not pristine with an RV camp ground directly in front of the hotel and oil derricks in the distance. The staff is pleasant and helpful, especially the bell staff but housekeeping was dismal. The first day our room wasn’t made up, even after requesting it twice and they skipped us the second day too. I finally had to call late in the afternoon on our second day to request it be made up and have coffee and water replenished. Annoying for a property charging $500+ per night.

Not my first stay, but my longest. I will return as my travel takes me back to the LA area.   Positives - Had outstanding service by a desk team member, Tavia. She helped with several needs throughout my stay, but during checkout was of extraordinary help. Assisting me through several billing questions, solving an issue for me related to breakfast credits, and was super pleasant throughout! Service like that really makes me happy to return.  - Clean lobby, despite the crowds.  - Good food at Tanners.  - Awesome location.  Only downside is the service of the rooms doesn't take place every day, and was tough to get sometimes even when specifically requested (likely due to operating at near capacity i was told).

The guest rooms are very comfortable. The hotel is well situated across from the beach and close to restaurants and shopping.  I reserved an ocean view room which would have been called a partial ocean view in other locations.   My only problem with the stay was a malfunctioning thermostat that had to be replaced.  Even after it was replaced the thermostat was poorly responsive and wouldn't adjust the temperature for 45 minutes or more.

I verified this three times on my reservation call. When I arrived I opened my door, walked to the window you see the roof of an ugly building. IF you walk out into the balcony and look west you can see the ocean. I called the front desk and they said that their definition of a full ocean view means you can’t see the ocean from your room. I asked what a partial ocean view was and they stated it was the same thing but further back so you could only see a sliver of the ocean. Terribly misleading.

We ate a couple of times at a Mexican restaurant and had the Nachos and tacos. They were great. We had Coffee a couple of times at Philz Coffee and it was ok if you like the hand pour thing.

Plus the Tanners Bar pumps the tunes pretty late into the night so the extra 50 bucks a night isn’t worth it. We have stayed ON the beach in Florida and that’s awesome. This is not that.

However the bonus is you feel welcomed, pampered, and comfortable too!!  We live in HB and anticipated the opening of this new hotel. The location is KEY. You are literally minutes from the pier and all the action, yet you can have your own private sanctuary from it all if you desire! We highly recommended this place for young and young at heart alike!

We were greeted by Paul at the valet. He was wonderful! Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we thought we would visit the pool. Well that was a problem....The pool was a zoo! There was staff all around, however, not one person offered to help trying to find any sort of chair or towel for that matter.  We left the hotel property and visited our friends at a property next door and hung out at their pool until our room was ready. We finally called the hotel to check to see if our room was ready (3 pm) and spoke to a wonderful guest services representative by the name of Mary Carmen. She was wonderful!

Upon check in Ali was great and very helpful. The room was wonderful as well as the view. We stayed in an ""oceanfront"" room where we could see the shoreline as well as Pacific Coast Highway. There was complimentary wine in the room which was awesome. The bed was super comfortable. We slept great. Housekeeping was also great with providing extra towels and amenities when needed. The hotel was absolutely kid friendly. They even had a kiddy pool which is very shallow. My son loved it! Overall it was such an amazing stay. Great customer service.

27 helpful votes,84 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful New Property,"We stayed 3 nights in an ocean front room on the 4th level....the room was beautiful and well-appointed. The Frette linens and bedding were a nice touch. Obviously the view of the water and HB were fantastic, and the traffic on PCH was well insulated courtesy of the high-end sliders. We really enjoyed the breakfast offerings included with our package at Tanner's each morning, as well as the cute coffee shop in the lobby and the open air bar above the restaurant. To a person, the staff was friendly and welcoming; the valet boys, in particular.
