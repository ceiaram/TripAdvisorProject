4 helpful votes,5 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible,"Gary is the rudest, most unprofessional person I have ever had to deal with. We had confirmed reservations weeks in advance. On the day of the stay he called and told us that he would not honor the reservation unless we paid 20% more than agreed. Pure extortion. He said, ""What, you think I am a dump? I would never agree to such a low rate."" But we had the confirmation and everything. We just kept our mouths shut, took his extortion and vowed to let everyone know what they are getting into. Beware, Gary (the owner) may switch your reservation at the last moment and for the new price you can stay in a MUCH better place.",August 2015,Avoid Town House Motel at all costs.,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,472
none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,gary is the best,"This was an AWESOME experience. We thought we would enjoy knotts, but we didn't expect to have such a good time at the hotel as well. Usually the hotels around the attraction parks are just tourist traps. NOT THIS ONE.  First of all the staff was very friendly. The place was clean, and we felt like home. The room had everything one would expect from a top brand hotel.  An excellent value for the money. Quality is not just in their name, but is their business..  And of course, the proximity to Knotts made everything even better. Just being able to crash into our beds after an exhausting day at the park, so quickly...priceless",March 2014,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,472
4 helpful votes,8 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,No Reservations,I worked with the hotel for 3 days before coming up to the Buena Park area for a weeks vacation.  I spoke to a gentleman named Gary who had given me a great price because I was retired military. I did everything he asked me to do including calling him to tell him when I would be arriving on June 20th.  I arrived 15 minutes earlier than I had said.  No Gary ! and no room!  Please go to a hotel or motel that makes reservations and is serious about their business. Thanks to Motel 6 I had a great week.  Avoid this place.,June 2014,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,472

Подъезжая к городу Ангелов, уже начало вечереть и мы решили поесть и найти ночлег. Когда поужинали, стемнело, решили найти отель и как оказалось, часть отелей имели завышенный ценник, а недорогие мотели были заняты и вот мы увидели Таун Хаус мотель - китайский мотель. 40$ - отлично. Но когда зашли и расположились в номере для некурящих в номере стоял такой жесткий запах табака, что супруге стало плохо, открыл окно проветрить. А когда расстелил кровать, увидел что простынь грязная и в волосах, т.е. постельное бельё даже не сменили. Это была последняя капля и мы решили сменить номер, но и во втором номере была тоже грязная постель. После мы собрались, забрали деньги за номер и поехали искать другой отель.
