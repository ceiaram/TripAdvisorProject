Assures me that my Renaissance choices are always meeting my expectations. Hotel is located far from the LA noise in friendly neighborhood near Orange County John Wayne Airport. Very close to Newport Beach. I really liked the live performance in the lobby at nights. Small fireplace outdoor makes you feel cosy and warm in breezy Christmas nights. Like most Renaissance hotels, the random modern objects in the lobby are wisely selected and arranged which bring an artistic character to the hotel. In close neighborhood, you can go to South Coast Plaza for shopping and there are plenty of good food options nearby.  The Bad: Parking can be a problem.

We reserved this on December 16th and paid it in full. When I arrived on the 23 I was told it was not paid. After stating that it had been and the front desk telling me it wasn't, I decided to just pay for one night and figure it out tomorrow. They charged around $220. The next morning I called the front desk to confirm it had been paid. I spoke with Stacy, who said that it had been paid and they would refund the money immediately, which they never did. The next morning my sister bought something from the hotel store which was $32.33. When I woke up the $32.33 charge was made on MY card.

The Irvine/Newport Beach Location has the consistent appeal of a high quality product. This is a hotel you want to stay in versus settling for.

It only happened one night but east coast jet lag had me in bed early.  The gym was also under renovation leaving a very limited space and equipment to train.

It was a buffet, but it was a very good buffet. I'm still thinking about the granola... I went back for seconds... okay, thirds... it was that damn good.  Fruit, meats, potatoes, and eggs were all well above standard buffet fare. Especially the potatoes... nice and crispy! The waitstaff was very attentive and kept my drink full. I would definitely go back for another round... especially the granola.  Pro Tip: If I remember correctly, my breakfast was comp'd because of my Marriott Platinum status (as they have no member lounge yet). The Duke is apparently fairly new to the Marriott family. Remember to ask for that.",December 2017,none,none,"Dear Bil M, We appreciate your recent stay and five star review.  You are so right the granola is to die for, I too find myself going back for more and has asked our Chef Jessica for the recipe many times.  Delighted that our waitstaff, were on it and that you enjoyed our Newport Beach lifestyle. Brian Keys General Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,197,86

You must try the mac n' cheese, it is fantastic! My son even brought along his Xbox One, typical teenager, in his own words,""The Wi-Fi was flawless; no time lag at all!"" :)  Exceptional stay!

It took about 20 minutes total to get from the hotel, return car and get through TSA (with PreCheck).  The room was typical but comfortable.  Views were fine.  the TV worked, and the bed was comfortable.",March 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,199,86
151 helpful votes,445 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent Hotel!,"I came to the Renaissance Newport Beach Hotel for a business conference and was really impressed with the facilities.  The hotel is really nice with good meeting rooms as well as hotel rooms.  The bar/restaurant area has tons of seating and there are outdoor options as well.  The room temperature control was great and the bed comfortable to sleep in.  The elevated pool area was very nice, although it's not open as late as I would like, but that's probably an effort to keep the noise level down for the guests in the nearby rooms.  The staff was extremely helpful - overall, I was very impressed with my time spent here.",May 2017,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,200,86
103 helpful votes,426 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Has potential,"This was the Duke when I stayed there early in Feb but it was being remodeled. I was pretty excited to stay here but the whole hotel was under remodel so I didn’t get to experience it fully— I did eat at the restaurant and I enjoyed my experience and it was Valentine’s Day so I had the special, steak and shrimp. Food, including dessert, was presented nicely, but the steak was over cooked. Service was good at the hotel and the room was nice— but the air ran all night but didn’t seem to be cooling. I would stay again based on the location to the airport and would be curious to see the remodel.",February 2018,none,none,"Dear katiehp2014,  We appreciate your recent stay and review.  We are now the Renaissance Newport Beach after extensive refresh and hope you come to see our new facility soon.

3 helpful votes,9 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent stay & will return back,"My husband and I stood here for our Anniversary and it was a lovely stay. There was a star employee by the name of Blair.  She was so professional, knowledgeable and very sweet. She upgraded our room and gave us suggestions on where to go after our dinner reservations. My husband and I travel often and I must say, first impression is everything and Blair made sure that our check in was not only positive but a great experience. That led the whole tone for the evening and I must say that our stay was more than perfect. Thank you for having people like Blair to work for your hotel that make people like us have a pleasant stay. The hotel was clean, nice and the room was super big with a nice patio and great view. The only negative I could honestly say is the security of that night",February 2018,none,none,"Patty,  We appreciate your five star review and recent stay.  Delighted that Blair was such a positive for your stay, I will look into our security as we obviously need some training there.  Thank you for your insight into our hotel.
