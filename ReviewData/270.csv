It’s a choice that they make in conjunction with their leadership team if they’re going to go the extra step for their guests.

1 helpful vote,5 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great place to stay when visiting Disneyland,"From our check-in to check-out, the staff were very friendly and helpful, (although they did not have the correct info on the shuttle bus.)  Breakfast was very comprehensive and although the layout caused some delays in accommodating the busiest times, the choices were sufficient and the quality fine.  The room was a good size for a family of four, and comfortable and clean.    Pros -- Value, pool and proximity to Disneyland.  ART Shuttle 12 stopped outside the hotel and a 3-day bus pass cost ~$10.  Also an easy 20-30 minute walk; less to the restaurant areas.  Cons -- The air conditioner was very loud and made it difficult to sleep.  We used a portable white noise machine and just left the fan on (without engaging the compressor) all night.

I opened the room door and immediately was hit with the most awful smell. It smelled like a cat had sprayed down the place for a few days. I picked up the phone, asked if they allowed pets, they said no, I told them this room smelled like cats and they said, "" no problem come down and swap keys. Second room was not smelly, but a bit stale. Dated interior, a little worn. Refrigerator was barely cold and had a ring of soaked carpet around it. We booked because of the fridge/micro and close proximity to disneyland. Turns out it's physically not far but with the lay of the roads (which you can't walk) it was really far, we had to drive and pay for parking for disney.

She and her fiance were wanting to make this trip during their spring break from college. I booked and paid for everything in advance.   When my daughter arrived, she called me immediately to say they put her in a smoking room, which she told me stunk really bad. I called the front desk and asked for the manager. She told me there was nothing she could do. They were totally booked and she said the TA confirmed a smoking room. I found this very difficult to believe on two counts. It was only 11:00am in the morning , so there were still other rooms being cleaned. She was just too lazy to switch rooms. The other, my TA knows we are non smokers.

We wanted a hotel that had a continental breakfast plus a refrigerator and microwave in the room and this hotel fit that criteria. We were also impressed with the location; close to the freeway and to Disneyland but it was very quiet. Our flight arrived by 9:30 am and after renting a car, we arrived at the hotel by 11 am, not really expecting our room to be ready but figured it was worth a try. NO PROBLEM!!  We were able to check in early and we had a wonderful room at the end of the hall facing Disneyland.

The price is fair compared to the standard on the hotel. Its clean and has a good location in Anaheim.  Our only problem was the Indian/Pakistan people that worked the reception when we arrived, they basicly sold us the sightseeing where they made the largest profit, instead of giving us the best value. They sold us a Coach sightseeing of LA, which was terrific, but we also wanted a trip to Universal Studios with Coach at 50$. But the receptionists told us that Coach did not preform this trip anymore and we would have to go with another company at 68$ pr person. Coach did in fact do the tour and that made us really mad.

The doors and furniture are a bit worn but not distractingly so. The pool looked inviting but we didn't use it; the exercise room has just the basics.
