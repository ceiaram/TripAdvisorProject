They requested $25 in cash when we checked in and returned the $25 in the morning. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The power button knob was missing from the heating/cooling unit. A knob was missing from the dresser. The TV was huge but you have to stand right next to it to aim the remote properly. The bathtub had no stopper. It was a cheap, okay hotel for one night.",May 2022,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,357

We been told that we can get our money back if they charged us wrong and my husband went to the desk hoping to get our motel room over charged us back and the Indian guy was a goof he won't give my husband and the other guest that stayed here as long like us there money back. We been here almost 3 months giving the guy business like we pay in time and in advance the rest of the time but I cannot believe they treat us like crap especially when their room is freaken dirty and stinks and walls are filled with snots and boogers and there hair dryer almost caught my hair on fire.

The next morning, we found out that... -There were rap droppings in the cabinet, -fridge and microwave were so filthy, we could not use them, -a hole on the inside part of the bathroom door which the owner tried to blame on us when it was there from the beginning, -stains in the shower bathtub, -stains in the walls of the room. We stayed in room 112. I tried to reason with the owner as soon as I discovered at how disgusting the place is and request for a partial refund; he would not. I then request for a deluxe king room which I ordered but he gave us a regular which I payed for: he would not. I then requested for a full fefund; he said no. I walked away angrily and cursing",October 2020,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,357
