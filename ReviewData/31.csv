Service at the pool is always spot on whether it is getting towels, drinks, or food.  The main pool is consistently filled with kids playing screaming or crying.  Parents are oblivious. At the same time most chairs at the kiddie pool are empty and hardly anyone is in that beautiful pool.  Babies in diapers in the jacuzzis is both a health hazard to the children and to anyone else who comes in.  Pool staff needs to immediately take families with children to the kids pool when they come in the gate.

Whilst I think resort fees are a rip off I could expect a $30 a day fee but $50 is beyond silly.  Secondly, and this is what disappointed me most was to find valet charges of $50 a day on top and this was not transparent when I booked and you literally have no choice you cannot self park.  These should be included in the resort fee. Also $10 for a bottle of water and silly prices in the in house restaurants.  2) Housekeeping was massively inconsistent.

Typically when I pay $800 a night for a room a bottle of water is provided. The movie system in place defaults to a gimmick that i have seen before.

We spent little time there and only ate once at the Aveo restaurant. Thew view of the golf course and grounds was stunning.  The staff were amazingly helpful and friendly. The rooms were excellent. The food was very good.  Nothing bad to say other than if you only sleep here then the price is a little high, but that was our problem not the resorts! So for us the value was a little over the top.  Location was the other downside. For this we prefer the Surf and Sand in Laguna.

But, I can say that while Monarch was not flawless, it was one of the better five star hotels I have stayed recently.   I was a little hesitant about the resort because it is not on the ocean but rather across the PCH over a hill, and it is a very large resort and I have had customer service issues with comparably sized ocean front California resorts.

I have family in Dana Point so am always looking for a good place to stay here.  I was excited to experience the new Monarch Beach Resort which shares it's spa concept with the world-class Miraval Spa.    My suite was spacious and beautiful and very expensive (prices higher than when it was St. Regis).  Therefore I felt it to be unacceptable that they charge a fee to use their steam room.  If I were in the standard room category I could perhaps understand but in a Monarch Suite I find it to be quite insulting.

The restaurant meals seemed overpriced and the one institutional meal I had, which was served to our group on the big lawn, had shade for less than half of the guests, the rest had to eat in the blazing hot sun.  So hot that the silverware couldn't be held without a napkin, the cold drinks quickly got very warm, and the dessert melted.  In my opinion, the most egregious practice, however, was the growing hotel habit of adding ""resort fees"" to quoted room charges, which are quite high already.

The location at Dana Point in southern Orange County is perfect for a lazy beach get-away with clear blue skies and ocean without the fuss of a major tourist hub.  What made it more enjoyable was that the hotel stay was partly free with SPG points and all the deluxe accommodations felt like a bonus instead of hole in my wallet. The hikes to the private beach were enjoyable. My kids brought pedal scooters (Razors) which they used to ease them along the way and allowed us to explore more of the grounds had they been on foot.

The noises completely ruined what would've been a lovely stay at your hotel.  2) The layout of the hotel building is a bit confusing to navigate, and the signs aren't helpful enough.  3) there was no electric kettle to boil hot water in the room, and when we asked for it, it took 30 minutes for the staff to bring a bottle of hot water.

We explained we were part of the wedding party but that did not matter, they would call when a room was available.  At 3pm I finally went back to state we would take any room since the wedding started in an hour.

What's great about the hotel is that there is a lot to do-- golf, tennis nearby, a pricey spa, and swimming.  What I love most is the beach club access.  While the resort is not on the beach, you do have access to the beach through the private club they have there.

Last year, I was travelling to NYC and it was the first time I was staying at the W, Times Square. That week was one of the busier times of the year for NYC and most of the Starwood properties were all full. Johnny offered to write a letter to the W hotel essentially telling them I was good guy and, if possible,to select a nice room for me.
