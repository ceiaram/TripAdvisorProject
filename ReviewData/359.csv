The freezer is completely filled with old ice from not being defrosted. The door I don't even want to touch it so dirty. The only security they have is a little chain instead of the good security locks that usually have in hotels. Just overall I don't want to touch anything. Luckily I had a blanket in the car so I'm going to just lay on that tonight. Like I said not true of all Motel 6 is but it certainly isn't this one.

I live in Los Angeles but I wanted to spend the night and attend early morning Easter services at the Cathedral without driving back and forth to LA.   For the amount that you paid, myself included, I really don't know what there is to gripe about.  My A/C and heater was great.  The TV worked, my phone worked (wake up call included) there was a coffee brewer, with coffee, in the room as well as a microwave and mini refrigerator.  The room was clean!' clean sheets on the bed and there were no bed bugs/mites (I checked).  The bathroom were sanitized and I was supplied with as many towels by the room cleaning",April 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,37,359

Usually under $70 a night, wow  is all i can say, everything i needed was there, the service was great, and even a free continental breakfast.

Having had the education of Hospitality, I can trully say that they did not have one clue as to what ""accomodating"" means. The staff at the front desk was rude. They judge us and ""cancelled"" our reservations because we were not properly dressed. They immidiately assumed that just because my friends wore high trend hip hop clothes that we were going to cause trouble. They were very rude and irritating.

Being a girl travelling alone I had hoped to stay a little closer to the office, but no.  I asked for a possible late c/o and since I c/in so late I thought that they may grant me an hour's grace as I had an appt. to go to @ 2:30, with no where else to go and luggage in tow.  They told me that they would charge $10 per hour and that I had to pay up front.  I didn't really have much choice so I did.  I didn't feel at all safe in the facility.

My family an I made reservations at the Econo Lodge, Garden Grove, for 2 weeks. When we arrived, we paid for 2 weeks in advance ($700.00). Well the management, during the second day of our stay was so rude, and disrespectful towards my wife. My wife had went outside of our room, to ask the maid for some more clean towels, and while she was talking to the maid, the lady in the office, the management or the owner, not sure, comes up to my wife, yelling at her and telling her not to talk to the maid at all. If my wife needed some more towels, she was told to simply hand the maid the dirty items, to be exchanged, not saying one word to the maid, and she would know what my wife",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,46,359
