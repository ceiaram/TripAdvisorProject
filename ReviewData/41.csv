The room was spacious, well lit, with nice linens, and the king size bed was very comfortable. They offer amenities like a Keurig and a minibar in the room (no heir dryer, though). At 5pm they offer free wine at the lobby and at 6pm, recently baked cookies. In the morning they have coffee and a large variety of teas.  The view of the sea from the hotel is obstructed but Laguna Beach is such a lovely town, you probably will not spend too much time at the hotel.  The best part of Laguna Beach House was the service.

It was large, comfortable, equipped with an amazing bed, and functional. Also, very cute. If based on the room, this would be a four star review. So - why only two stars?  What was wrong?  What’s wrong is that they have unscrupulous business practices. The price of the room isn’t the price of the room. If you drive, add $40 per night. They charge $20 for parking (which doesn’t bother me except they don’t disclose it). They also charge $20 per night for “amenities.”  Yes, I asked “what amenities?”  For $20 added to your room price, you get wi-fi, a beach chair, bath robes, wine in the evening in the lobby, and coffee in the morning in the lobby.

Although this is a cute hotel, it’s a little pricey for what you get. First of all, the view of the fireworks is phenomenal. We felt like we were immersed in the festivities, which was wonderful. The proximity to the park and the views of the ocean are a real plus. I loved the pool and the Jacuzzi.  But we were surprised to hear that there was an amenity fee of $15 which I thought was a little unusual. I think this included access to the pool, pool towels, and maybe the cookies, the wine and  granola and coffee in the morning. The cookies were gone when we came downstairs one evening.

28 helpful votes,39 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Honestly it depends how much you pay,We visited the Laguna Beach House in March 2016. Most of what the other reviewers have said is true: the staff is nice; the rooms are big and the hotel is very well decorated. However we paid close to 350$ a night if you include the pool side room; parking and the resort fee. For close to that price; there were ocean view rooms at the surf and sand (4star resort) or Laguna's Inn. Lbh is not worth that price; at most they should be charging 200/250$ a night.
