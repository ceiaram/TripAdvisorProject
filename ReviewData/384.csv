none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Look elsewhere!,"Small hotel. Very run down, not very clean. I don't know how anyone rated this as, ""Excellent"" !!!! If you are thinking about this hotel as a LAST resort, it will do..but look elsewhere first !!

During the peak of summer. clean, clean, very clean. close to shopping, and disneyland. a new water resort park being built across the street. the motel is behind the days inn. The cheapest place we found. Renovated, cable, wifi, Owners very nice. would reccomend to family and friends. Not unclean, stayed also at Rodeway Inn. Paid alot and the carpet was filthy . Stay at Harbor Motel you will not regret it.",February 2015,"Quiet, no one bothers you. Just relax and enjoy",Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,2,384
4 helpful votes,6 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Close to Disney but unclean,"We stayed here for one night because we were going to Disneyland. It's a short drive. The room had everything we needed which wasn't much, but it was not clean. I found hair and stains on my pillow and there was hair in every corner of the bathroom. There was an AC but it was so loud we couldn't leave it on. Other than that it was your average motel, but next time I am willing to pay a little more to be in a clean room.",July 2015,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,384

The rooms are old and dirty. The bathroom was disgusting.   I can't recommend this motel to anyone.,July 2015,none,Traveled with friends,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,384
86 helpful votes,134 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Basic and clean motel,I stayed here for business but the motel was a great location for theme parks.  There's a small shopping centre opposite to get basic groceries and a few restaurants (nothing special).  Check in was a little tricky because the owner had a temporary staff member in who struggled to speak english. But overall would probably stay again if looking for a budget motel in this area.,June 2015,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,384
11 helpful votes,31 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fresh, clean and relaxing.",The place is clean...the rooms are fresh and the family that runs it pays close attention to detail. Very pretty garden as well. I would stay here again.  It is close to Disneyland and several other attractions. Nearby there are shopping centers and a Target as well.,April 2013,none,none,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,6,384
