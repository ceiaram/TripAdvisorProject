There is no restaurant on site and nearby ones are closed around 9 pm.   I found a great Bloody Mary spot at the nearby golf course.  This place is between Pebble Beach, Carmel and Monterey.   It is much more laid back than Monterey.   There are great restaurants in Carmel too and is a close drive.",July 2020,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,456
