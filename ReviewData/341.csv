We occupied 2 rooms during our visit and we were very satisfied with the cleanliness of the motel both inside and outside.  Each day of our visit I noticed the staff diligently working to maintain the premises.  The rooms were clean, spacious and the beds were very comfortable.  The large bathrooms were a plus!  We enjoyed meeting the other guests that were vacationing too.  The location is great.  Shopping, dinning and the beach are all within walking distance.  The overall value way exceeded my expectations!

It was very clean and quiet for a motel. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. They are pet friendly and they have an open lot right next door for walking your dog. If you can manage to book the suite, I recommend that you do. It has a barbeque and fire pit in a small courtyard right outside of it.

Upon arrival we eventually managed to get a reply to the bell, saw a member of staff for about 2 minutes and that was the last time we saw anyone so can’t comment on the staff.  The room was pretty bare, poorly maintained and grubby.  It smelt of a weird chemical air freshener which we left on as it was used to overpower the odour of dog. The original air con unit was broken but still there & a portable one stood in the room with the intake hose out through the bit of wood which replaced a window, this meant the room was light & noisy too as the broken blinds didn’t shut properly.

It is a very ordinary 50's/60's mom & pop style motel, in a great location with very friendly, helpful and accommodating staff. It is clean with some updated fixtures, but the air-conditioning didn't work and the refrigerator was inadequate for my needs.  The pictures on the website show a full sized refrigerator but I was told that is in the motel's only suite.  The room we stayed in didn't look anything like the pictures on the websites.

You stayed in a pet friendly room, and because they are pet friendly, we kept the rooms pretty basic, with just a flat screen TV, pillow-top mattresses, end tables, a dresser, fridge & microwave and free WiFi service.  Our other rooms which aren't pet friendly, are a bit more decorated and furnished.  As far as the full refrigerator goes, that is only available in our suite, which comes with a full kitchen with stove/oven, sink, and private patio area with BBQ, fire-pit and patio furniture.  The rest of the rooms have smaller refrigerators and microwaves.  If you decide to come back in the future, without your pet, we can put you in one of our more upgraded rooms!  Thank you again.

The motel is very well situated and a 20 minute walk from the beach.  I would describe the motel as basic but clean.  The manager is a very helpful and cheery person who really does care about his customers.    The motel is going through some remodelling and during our stay there was a bit of work going on which at times felt like we were living on a construction site.  This unfortunately made our stay a bit frustrating as we had a small baby who struggled to fall asleep with the noise.  I say this not to portray the motel in a negative light, quite the opposite in fact.

We happened to try and find a room during a town festival so all places were booked solid. The location was good and we were grateful we were next door to some shops and very close to the beach. The staff were excellent and very friendly. However the room we had was showing its age and definitely lacking in ways. The bathroom was clean but definitely in poor condition. The air conditioning was a portable unit that was in the bathroom and couldn't reach to the bedroom. And I made the mistake of walking on the carpet barefoot which turned my feet black. I dont think any cleaning could save it.

We are actually new owners who took over the place last July, so you must have stayed with us when we first took over.  Since your stay, we have completely remodeled the rooms, replacing all carpet and vinyl flooring, bringing in brand new king pillow-top mattresses, flat screen TV's, microwaves and fridges.  We have all new vanities and light fixtures and have added WiFi internet connection, which is free for our guests.  As you know, we are in a great downtown location, where you can walk to the beach and all the shops and restaurants on Avenida Del Mar.  Also new since your stay, is the new Ralphs grocery store, which just opened up down the street, walking distance... so for nights you don't feel like going out, you can make dinner in your room or snack and watch a movie.  We are a great value stay!   Hopefully you can come visit us again and see what we've done with the place!  Jed",none,none,none,none,none,none,97,341
