Check out bikes at Activity room and ride along the beach.  My grandsons attended a top-notch baseball camp nearby and this location was very convenient.  We swam at the pool or at the beach every evening, rode bikes, and barbequed in our own unit.  Didn't like that we had towels/bedding changed only once in the week, but we survived!

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst Time Share Experience EVER!!,"More like a Motel than a resort. Everything was outdated. The kitchen was not adequate. The bedrooms were tiny and you could not open the dresser drawers because they hit the bed. The room was dirty and 80 degrees when I went inside. I complained to the manager and they were very rude. I had to call the main office to get some results. The carpet was ripped and dirty and the lighting was ""energy savers"" It was so dark I could not read a book or magazine after sunset. The restaurant was awful. The hallways had water damage. It was a nightmare vacation!!!!!!  DO NOT BOOK THIS RESORT!!!!!",June 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,347,224
3 helpful votes,7 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointed! Expecting more....,"We booked a 1 bedroom unit back in November 2007.  We were excited about our unit having an ocean view!  Well, it had an ocean view that was separated by the Pacific Coast Highway and the railroad track!  It was very noisy sitting out on your balcony..if it wasn't cars it was trains!  There was only 1 window in our unit...which was the sliding glass door (which was put on backwards).  The bedroom was small and felt like a dungeon...because there was no light!  In fact, we couldn't tell if it was daylight or night when we were sleeping.  One positive...the bed was very comfortable!  The bathroom was good size and had a whirlpool bathtub.  The company really needs to put some money into this resort.  It is very outdated...carpet needs to be replaced, furniture replaced, etc.  By",May 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,348,224
25 helpful votes,17 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice location, Nice view, Old building, decent room","We traded in our week through interval international to stay here.  This place is just decent.  We stayed in the older phase 1 part of the resort and they didn't want to move us since most time-share folks like us stay there.  We stayed in a one-bedroom so we could get an ocean view.  The room is sort of small and kind of out-dated.   The guy at the activity desk was very helpful.  The people at the front desk didn't seem to care much about us- my husband had a question and he had to wait until the lady at the front desk was done with her personal telephone call.  Very nice location though- right next to Dana Point.  We got to go to the ocean institute, Wild animal park, Carlsbad, San Clemente, Disneyland, and Newport.  Overall, not very impressive- I wouldn't stay there again.",April 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,349,224

It has a very good location just off the I-5 and Pacific Coast Highway near Dana Point California.  Just a hop, skip and jump from the beach area and Dana Point shops.  1 negative was the Metrolink train system that was located just across the road from the resort. I was thinking after the first train went by, that would be it. On the contrary, it would be around 8-10 per evening.  No need to complain to management, because there is nothing they can do about it, so we just lived with it.  But, if you stay here and are a light sleeper, you may want to stay on the non-ocean view side.  As for the room itself, it was very roomy.  We had a 2-bedroom that we loved. Not exactly decorated for 2 toddlers running",March 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,350,224
