22 helpful votes,15 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,First impression: Worst hotel stay in memory,"I’ve stayed in many hotels on business and vacations over the years and each has had pros and cons—usually more pros than cons.   The pros here: convenient location, night light in the bathroom, and friendly staff.   The cons: when we arrived, our room thermometer said 78 degrees, and I believe it may have been even hotter! I set the temperature to 72, and the room quickly cooled to 69-and continued cooling. I set the thermostat to 72 again and the temperature started to rise & reached 76 before I caught it. I then watched it carefully until it cooled back to 73 and then turned the whole thing off. Except that the fan continues to cycle noisily about every 3 minutes.

Booked through Costco because it's a little cheaper (esp if you pay in advance) AND you still get your Hilton Honors points AND as an executive member, you earn your 2% from Costco.  Hotel was remodeled in the last year and it shows.  They have 4 floors.  We booked 3 king suites.  Clean, comfortable, spacious and although the bathrooms in the king suites don't have a tub, they do have a beautiful walk in shower that is big enough for two :).  Plenty of counter space, a little shelving cubby to store things.  The closet is built into the wall behind the mirror.  Almost missed it.  Rooms have mini fridges that work really well (cold).

The hotel was very clean, parking was plentiful and the service was amazing.  We enjoyed the personal attention that Crystal and her staff provided to my family.  The location is a 15 minute drive to the Disneyland Toy Story Parking Lot...very easy via Katella Ave. There is no Disney shuttle from this hotel.  If you stay at one of the hotels closer to Disneyland, you have to pay to ride their shuttles (per person) so it actually was cheaper to pay to park the Disney lot ($20).

In this day and age why is there no refrigerator in the room or microwave. For $158 down the street you can get a suite at the residence inn Marriott. The room feels dirty but I know it's not. The staff are very nice and friendly. The breakfast is nothing special and is typical continental style. The lobby and breakfast area is nice and updated. It is close to places to eat and next to a target. I spent 10 days here and if it weren't for colleagues I would have moved to another hotel.

However, I will tell you as a frequent business traveler for the past 25 years the reason why travelers choose the lower tier of Hilton Hotels like the Hampton is because typically they are all the same. The layout is usually identical, the rooms are similar including the earth tone paint and pictures on the wall. What's sets each one apart is primarily the staff and the age of the establishment. This particular Hampton has a staff that is extremely courteous and respectful which is not always an easy task after reading multiple hotel reviews over the years.

That said, my family and I had a fantastic stay at this particular hotel.   The front desk was wonderful and the individual who checked us in for our stay was incredibly personable and considerate for the duration of our stay.   The location of the hotel is within an office park, which means it is incredibly quiet but at the same time it is accessible to a number of amenities and landmarks. For example, we visited Disneyland California (approximately 20 minutes away) and a number of family friendly beaches that were fantastic.

If you are a light sleeper then it may not be the best fit for you. We stayed on the first floor overlooking the pool in room 128. We could hear someone in the next room snoring! The doors would slam shut and rattle the walls. The room we had did not have a bathtub only a walk in shower. That could be an issue for some people. The wifi was terrible. Never seemed to work.

We ended up moving to the third floor and that was better.

57 helpful votes,164 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good for business travel,"I am currently in my fourth (or fifth) stay at this hotel. There is nothing extraordinary about this hotel, but how much you need when you travel on business. The rooms are clean, check-in/check-out process is efficient. There is a plenty places to eat around the hotel. A couple things I wish were better - the internet is too slow and the workout facilities are too small/underequipped.",December 2011,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.

41 helpful votes,67 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very comfortable for the price,"We stayed here for 4 nights and the accommodations were surprisingly comfortable.  The room was always clean. The only criticism I have is that the cleaning people never left enough towels. We had to ask each day for more towels. It is a Hampton Inn, so the ""included"" breakfast isn't great but it is sufficient for an on-the-go meal.  They also have little goodie bags with friut, a bottle of water,  a breakfast bar, and a muffin that you can just grab and go. We stayed on the 4th floor at the very end of the hall and it was very quiet.",November 2011,none,none,Thank you for the great review of our hotel!

132 helpful votes,166 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Convenient,"Stayed for 3 evenings during a business trip in Southern California. Large and comfy rooms, even if somewhat dark. Details such as number of TV channels, free internet access leave little to complain for. A major drawback: no restaurant, cafeteria or bar in the hotel, and I haven't even seen a vending machine. But, quite a few restaurant options are available in the nearby shopping malls, which is truly walking distance away (2 minutes?). A basic but good quality breakfast is also available in the mornings. Parking, free and no problem at all. So, overall Hampton Inn gets a thumbs up, especially if you have things to do in this part of LA.",October 2011,none,none,Thank you for the great review of our hotel!

Was looking for a local hotel in the Hilton Family and found the Hampton Inn.  Great location off of Katella.  Very quiet, which was a big plus for us.  Lots of nice amenities, breakfast was great.
