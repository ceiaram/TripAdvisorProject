There is parking, but it can be very hectic especially the weekends where there are more guests.    I checked in via Hilton app, but the hotel isn't equipped with other doors other than your room so I had to enter through the main lobby.  There is a pool and a store for snacks, medicine, and whatnot.  There is a restaurant in the hotel and they are open for breakfast.    The room itself was clean and spacious.

We immediately called the front desk from the room phone but there was no answer. We rushed to get dressed and flee the building. Lights in the hall were flashing, and the fire doors closed. People were in the halls with pajamas. We followed some of those to the stairwell as we were on the 5th floor. I strained my knee on the way down as I’m a disabled person. We call the hotel number (949) 455-7000 from our cell but still no answer.  A short time later we reentered the lobby to be told it was “burnt toast”.

Rooms were a decent size, room to put suitcase and not feel like it had taken up the entire floor space, it was very clean, beds were really comfortable. Bathroom was modern and clean, shower had good water pressure.  Check in was easy, and fast. My booking was for a ground floor room which they changed for me so I could be on a quieter floor. The hotel was very quiet, no issue with that. Live music one of the nights - nice touch. Didn't try the food, but was available.

The afternoon staff were very welcoming and friendly, while the night staff was a little more gruff and grumpy. We did have one issue with our room.

The rooms were upscale, the bedding very comfortable, the windows quad-paned (if there even is such a word).  I couldn't even hear the freeway next to us.  The room also had a coffee maker, frig, microwave, and Bath and Body Works toiletries.  The front desk was very friendly, the restaurant food was typical fare - nothing to write home about, and I was very surprised with the underground parking.  It was raining most of the time.

Holiday Inn's (not Express or Staybridge) have lost their luster of the years but this property launches them right back and actually ahead of any hotel property in the area.  Let me rephrase that, besides something like the Ritz or Regis, there is not a better property in the area and I challenge any other property to try and compare.  As Holiday Inn invests money to improve their image, this one should be the benchmark for all of their properties.  Let's start with the bad.

However, our first visit was superb and our second stay was a real disappointment. We checked in on Friday and the room was nicely done - and nice and clean. The Saturday housekeeping staff didn't pay much attention to detail when the made up the room. We returned late Saturday evening to find they did not replace the washcloths, the coffee packets or the shampoo. Nor did they replace the empty Kleenex box. It was late so we didn't complain. When the room was made up on Sunday, they still did not supply washcloths, coffee or new Kleenex.

Yes it is close to the freeway, but the rooms are small, the pool and spa were filthy, and the staff didnt seem to care. The A/C wasnt working in one of the rooms and the manager finally switched the room but not before making sure he needed to have the key back to the room as soon as the room was switched out. Not so they could fix the ait, but so he could reuse the room for another guest. Are you kidding me? Knowing there was no air? Sorry would NOT stay here again. Not close to a grocery store and the only restaurant walking distance is Mc Donalds. Imagine Mc Donalds for 9 days! Hotel restaurant is in no way budget friendly. 4.95 for oatmeal? Ill pass.

Sadly, only my 7 year old could fit on the pull out and our daughter got to sleep with us on the King bed.
