We had read the reviews before we left and we were very concerned. The hotel was clean and the people were so friendly and helpful. We went to the restarant. The food was good and the prices were great. We never had to wait too long for the shuttle because they always made extra trips during the busy times.

We booked Katella Palms because it was reasonably priced ($92 ridiculously high tax included) and it's within walking distance to Angel's Stadium. I was skeptical of the motel because of some of the reviews here. But there was no reason to be, we found our room to be large and clean. Only complaint is that the bed was rock hard. Additionally, the outside noise could be heard from within the room. It didn't bother us, but I could see how could be bothersome for some. Lastly, we were annoyed that the hotel didn't carry ESPN or another sports channel. Overall, it was great stay.

My husband said it was probably the air conditioning.  Maybe they need to change the filters.    If your a sport fan they do not provide ESPN (my husband was very disappointed).
