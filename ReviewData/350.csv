I like that it does the basics well. Our room was large, clean, and sensibly priced. We stopped during a family emergency and it was great to have somewhere quiet to come back to.

That was the most warm and heartfelt welcome I have ever experienced at a hotel. As a former Director of Rooms (from Hawai'i) I would be proud to have an Agent of Mel's quality on staff.

none,3 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great But Hard To Find,"Needed a good, clean and affordable hotel and that's what I got.  It's clean, rates are great and experience was great.  I needed information in the a.m., hours, went to the front desk and they led me in right direction for a place to each.  Only thing is that the hotel is not directly off a major road or at least noticable and that made locating a bit tricky.  Once you get there it's not a problem.",November 2011,none,none,"Thank you for choosing Extended Stay Hotels and for taking the time to provide feedback about your stay.

none,4 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,A lot left to be desired,"The room smelled musty and old.  Room, especially bathroom were dirty.  The hotel was out of soap, so we had to go out to buy our own.  Stove was dirty and rusted, so we didn't feel comfortable using it.  Beds were old and uncomfortable.  We needed synthetic pillows due to allergies to down, but none were available.
