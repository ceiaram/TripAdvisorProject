So we headed to the Orange Circle, and made our way down Glassell. The Ruta's Old Town Inn is one of several Rutabegorz restaurants, of which we are most familiar is the one in Fullerton.  There is off street parking and limited parking behind the restaurant...We lucked out, and found a nice spot.  Choice of dining is in or out...It was a nice day, we ate out in the front patio area.   It was a light lunch of a combo of Chili and sandwich.   Rutabegorz, you can't miss...food was good as usual.",January 2020,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,440
28 helpful votes,33 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice place but needs some attention,"This is a beautiful older home perfectly situated on a main street near Orange Circle.  The bed was comfortable and it was fairly quiet.    A few things I'd like the management to address before I recommend it to others.  The shower had lots of mold in it, which is really not acceptable anywhere.  Also, when I made reservations the manager was friendly and nice, and she gave me a code to enter the front door.  When I got there the code didn't work, and I was lucky enough that other guests came along and told me the code.  This is advertised as a bed and breakfast.  The first day there I had a nice tray set up for me, and there were strawberries in cups in the refrigerator as well as english muffins in the freezer.  I made my own coffee, and had a nice breakfast with food I",April 2017,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,440
11 helpful votes,18 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Perfect 1-Night Stay,"Okay, I'm a LITTLE biased because I got engaged the night I stayed here! My fiancee booked this room because it was close to Chapman University (where we met) and the Circle. We stayed in the Orange Room and it was beyond adorable with custom painted murals all over the walls that looked like orange trees. It felt like a true B&B experience, with a kitchen available to all guests to use in this house (which has 3 rooms). There were snacks for breakfast like fruit, yogurt, juices, cereal. I would definitely stay again, especially for nostalgia's sake :')",October 2015,none,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,3,440
282 helpful votes,690 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Grandma's place rocks.,"Several other reviewers compared this to staying at Grandma's house, as if that was a bad thing. We stayed here and absolutely loved it. From the courtyard to the porch to the sitting areas to the room, we couldn't have felt more relaxed and welcome. There are just three rooms and even though we were here on a weekend, we never saw anyone else. We spent a lot of time just sitting on the porch people watching. They have a kitchen with continental breakfast included. You are just down the street from the plaza and its many restaurants and bars. We live local and are already planning a return visit.",August 2015,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,440
12 helpful votes,44 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Relaxing Comfortable and Affordable.,Rutas Inn is very homey. We stayed in the orange room our son stayed in the bluebird room. Each room had its own bathroom. There was one other room but it was empty 2 of the 3 days we were there. It was like having the whole house to ourselves. There is a great restaurant next door. Old Town shops and eatries are half block away. If you stay the citrus grill is a must along with watsons drug store dinner. The surrounding neighborhoods have some great houses to see while walking or running. We loved our stay in rutas old town inn.,January 2015,none,none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,440
10 helpful votes,24 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Valentines Weekend at Ruta's,"My wife and I stayed in the Rose Room and had a very nice weekend.  The property is charming and our room was very quiet, despite the busy street outside filled with Chapman students and tourists going to Old Town Orange.  Very nice serve-yourself breakfast, including coffee, tea, milk, a variety of juices, fresh fruit, yogurt, several cereals, English muffins, etc.  There was wifi available and a large-screen TV, but we never used either one - we stay at B&Bs to get away from all that, and we were able to at Ruta's.  We plan to visit there again when we need a quiet weekend away.",February 2014,none,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,6,440
22 helpful votes,108 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice Property & Location - Needs Cleaning,"Really like the style of home and comfortable setting.  Very close to Chapman and downtown Orange.  The place needed to be vacuumed and dusted - just carpet debris and dirt in common areas and the rooms.  Also, we stayed over a week and the bathrooms were not cleaned the entire time.  No on-site manager to oversee things and this makes a difference.",December 2013,none,Traveled with family,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,7,440
36 helpful votes,23 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Comfortable enough, but felt like I stayed in a museum","Hazel W's review is spot-on... Ruta's is just like staying with your grandmother!  Don't get me wrong. The place is very comfortable (like grandma's), the property is lovely (like grandma's), and the kitchen is self-service (like grandma's). But also, the decor is questionable (like grandma's), and all the museum-like pieces that are on display are probably off-limits (like grandma's).  I stayed in the bluebird room, which doesn't have a television, but does have a painting of a tree on the wall in the bathroom (like grandma's).  Unlike grandma's, however, wifi works better than you might expect. And there are superb dining options next door and down the street (read: waffle sandwiches and beyond!).",January 2013,none,Traveled on business,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,8,440
24 helpful votes,44 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Right where you want to be,"There is something disconcerting about Orange, California: large expanses of agriculture mixed in with suburban sprawl, so Old Town is a welcome relief from everything that seems wrong in the area.  Ruta's Old Town Inn is in the heart of Old Town, surrounded by delightful arts & crafts bungalows, fabulous restaurants, and little shops that lend an air of old California to a visit.  Ruta's has three rooms.  I stayed in the Rose Room, the largest, with its own television suite, which I never used.  It felt like staying in someone else's grandmother's house, but I loved the feeling.  The bed was comfortable, the shower was hot and strong, and the kitchen was open so that I could fix myself breakfast at an obscenely early hour because my body was still on East Coast time.
