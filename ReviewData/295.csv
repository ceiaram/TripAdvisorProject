Location was great, close to Knott's and affordable places to eat with the family.   The room needed some definite TLC. The carpet was very grimy, and none of us felt comfortable walking barefoot on it. The walls were very beat up and dirty.

The beds were comfortable, pillows were lumpy, and the sheets and blankets were extremely thin, even to the point of holes in several spots.   Customer service was mediocre at best.

At first I thought it was a spider, so I went to the front desk and asked them to send a maid up to change the sheets and vacuum. The next night, I woke up at 2:30am with bites all down my arms. I was horrified, and sat awake in the room with the light on trying to figure out what to do. That’s when I actually saw the bugs crawling on the sheets. I took my baby and went and slept in my van. This is going to be ridiculously expensive to take care of now that we’re home.
