When I booked it I thought it was in some kind of remote or woodsy location, or some out-of-the-way bucolic area. It is not. Following directions in WAZE we pulled into what I thought was an upscale shopping mall. Very disappointed, there sat the hotel. It looked great but the location was not what I expected. Once we got inside, I began to understand what this place really is - an oasis. This may be unfair to the hotel, but if you look at it as a chain hotel on luxury steroids, I think you get the picture. Everything about the place is generous.

Our room did not have the promised antique furnishings or resemble a European boutique hotel in any way. The bed was extremely hard/uncomfortable.

I am very sorry that your stay with us was unsatisfactory.  Whenever we have a wedding we do our best to ensure that the wedding party stays in close proximity to one another, both for logistical and celebratory reasons. At this time, we already had an elderly long term guest using a room in this particular block. We try very hard to respect the needs of all of our guests to ensure they will have a comfortable stay, and this guest was looking for rest at this hour. We tried to accommodate him by attempting to lower the noise level of the hotel and surrounding rooms several to no avail. I am very sorry for any issues this may have caused you or the wedding party as I know this was a special event.  In the future, please know that we have ample banquet space available for these types of occasions, which would allow for a celebratory gathering without worry of what is happening in the remainder of the hotel.

I spent three nights there while attending a business conference. The Ayers hotels are a small and, I think, privately owned hotel chain competing in the “semi-boutique” market.

There is also something of a happy hour at which jug wine and canned beer is set out along with cheese and crackers. The main thing that I didn’t like was the air conditioning.

There is no bar in the hotel, and hence no real meeting place in the hotel - probably a frequent request of other travellers - unsure whether this is due to the family rules, or that the hotel is located in a senior residential area.
