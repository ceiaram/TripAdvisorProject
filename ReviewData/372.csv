I have two autistic sons with me and they cannot access anything. I cannot check into my flight or work. Also, woke up with bug bites all over my legs. They rufuse to offer any compensation. Was going to stay another night. Leaving as this is unacceptable. Also, toilet running and the trundle bed is nothing but hard springs covered in cheap foam.

1 helpful vote,3 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great location, terrible management","We moved out of Orange County but I still needed to come to Lake Forest for work so this was my ""home"" for the last 18 months.  I stayed there at least 2-3 times per month.  It started out great - the last 6 months have been terrible.  The really friendly staff is gone and replaced by people who wouldn't event quality to work at the DMV.  They are just rude.  One reason I stayed there was the vehicle charging stations.  For months they didn't work.  I reported this every week and they insisted they are working.  I would go outside and take a picture of them not working and they still did nothing about it.  Finally they admitted there was a problem. They literally don't care what you say or if you enjoy your stay or not.

73 helpful votes,109 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great value!,"My family and I were very happy with our 5-night stay. We found it clean, modern, and comfortable. The room has an odd layout; for instance,  the closet is at the back of the room instead of by the door, but no big deal. I like that the fridge and microwave are tucked away inside a cabinet. The staff we encountered were all pleasant and helpful. We happily paid the reasonable $8/day parking. It is underground and secure.  The fitness centre is better than the pictures on the website make it look. All the machines and equipment is new and in good working order. The breakfast buffet is very good, especially since it's included. The same things were served every day, but there's big variety of hot and cold items to choose from, it doesn't matter.

none,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent Customer Service,"We were part of a larger skating group that stayed at this hotel.  Aside from the comfy beds, beautiful decor and West Elm sleeper sofa.  The acting manager Sarah F went out of her way to fix a problem where we had booked a double queen but got assigned a king room.  She was ready to comp us another room to make it right but kept looking and ultimately found an issue with an accidental over ride.  I think when they asked us for choices of room to be closer to other skating family, the front desk person accidently changed it to a king room.  All was well and she comped us some snacks, happy kids happy trip.  We enjoyed our stay here.  Walking distances to food, drinks etc can't really complain.  Even the underground parking lot was pleasant to be in.  Also appreciate the eco",November 2022,double queen with sleeper sofa was great,none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,372

I decided to go downstairs and let the front desk know to please have housekeeping not enter or knock on the door. After letting them know, and watching the girl in the front ""text house keeping dept"". Not to my surprise, housekeeping was not notified, and they entered the room with no warning or a simple knock. Not long after that, that same front desk girl used her key and entered the room again without a knock, or a warning, or knowledge. Putting that aside, after finally checking out, I asked to speak with a manager. I was told that she hasn't been in, and will be coming in at 3pm.

2 helpful votes,5 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Average stay. Dont get a room facing the freeway!,"Family stay. We got a double bed room type at 3rd floor facing the freeway.  Pros:  1.  Location is ok. Restaurants in the plaza all around.  2. Room is spacious. Two doble beds and a trundle.  3. EV charging station in the parking structure. 4. Hotel is kind of new.  5. Refridge and microwave on site   Cons: 1.  Noisy. Dont not get a room facing the freeway. All day road noise. 2. No room service. You have to go to front desk to get the addition blanket and dental hygine in person. No slipper available. 3. Stay higher floor, people walk in a higher floor would be a bother for sure.",June 2022,Dont get a room facing the freeway.,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,7,372
