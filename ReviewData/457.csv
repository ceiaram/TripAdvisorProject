4 helpful votes,11 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great mountain biking,"This is a great park for mountain biking and hiking. Be aware there are snakes in the summer. There are many trails from beginner to advanced. The further back you go, the more you uncover. Amazing this is in the middle of one of the largest metropolitan areas one the planet.  There is no overnight camping at this facility.",June 2016,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,457
