My husband went in and asked the front desk agent (I think her name was Yessenia?) about a room and when he came out to talk to me about it (I was in the car with my littlest 2 kids), my 6 year old announced that she needed to use the bathroom. Back into the hotel they went! And it was an URGENCY! Upon asking to use the bathroom, my husband was told that ""they did not have public bathrooms."" He told the agent that it was for his daughter, and that she needed to go badly. NOPE! No bathroom for you!

Smelly- the first room was so bad I thought someone died in it.  The second room didn't smell, but all the surfaces were dirty, with garbage in the sink.  I felt for the first time in a long time that I really needed to check for bugs... At least none were found.  The place was loud, with one elevator sounding like it was ready to die, and the other one already dead. The upstairs neighbors were so loud that the light fixtures on my ceiling were knocked off very early in the morning. I thought they were doing group jumping jacks....

We chose this place based on the developers' prior experience. However, when they checked in to this location, they said that the rooms were the smallest they have ever stayed in and the desk was tiny with a very bad chair so they couldn't even work. When I booked it just a week ago, the rate was $99/night. But because I was cancelling they prorated it back to daily rate that at this time was around $160/day. So for the 5 days they stayed they are charging us $160/night.

My first observation was with sanitation and cleanliness. On my floor there was an enclosed garbage room that was not collected timely so the smell permeated the entire floor. When you opened the door there were open trash bags on the floor and the smell knocked you over. I also experienced vomit in the stairwell for an entire weekend. They allow pets so the room next to me has a small dog that has been barking all night. Apparently the owners left it alone.

The room was clean, comfortable, and best of all, it includes a kitchen and refrigerator.  The cost was about $80 per night weekday, and dropped by $10 per night on the weekend.  The hotel is located close to the Orange County airport, and within walking distance from several restaurants.

It was a Saturday night and the local hotels were full or filling up, and the prices on the low end were rising into $100 plus territory.  The ""classy"" Newport Beach hotels were much more, of course. Extended Stay was just short of $80 (including tax) on Hotels.com.  It has free parking, which is rare indeed in Newport Beach.     We were apprehensive because of the mediocre scores from reviewers around the 2 stars mark.  However, all was well and we were not disappointed. The first non-smoking room smelled of smoke, but the desk clerk gladly exchanged our room.    The room was a decent size and had a small kitchen if you wanted that.  A toaster and a microwave.
