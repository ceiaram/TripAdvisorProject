We checked in to only find that our beds were doubles not queens so we went to inquire about that, he stated no queens were available but that's what we booked for(on their webpage it says they only have double queen beds not double doubles), our bathroom door wouldn't close or lock so we went to inquire. He showed us another room that was supposed to be non smoking but that room smelled so bad you couldn't hardly breathe so we said we would keep the one we had. We went to go to sleep as it was late and turned down the sheets....The bed sheets on both beds had bad stains. One matress cover had big ""D's"" in ink written all over the sheet as though it was marked for damaged or no good to use, I have no idea. There were hairs all over the sheets",August 2019,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,371

The water pressure was not even high enough for me to wash my hair. The water barely got warm enough to be comfortable. For $125 I feel like this should have been more like a $60 stay.

There is no breakfast, but there is a microwave and fridge in the room.  It is located on a strip with lots of other places to eat.

54 helpful votes,187 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Adequate For Short Stays,"This is a ""bare bones"" inn that is perfect if you need something in the area.  Our stay was for one night for a graduation that was taking place near by.  The rooms are just that....a room......a place to hang your hat and get some sleep.  They have microwaves in room, coffee and a fridge but no ""grounds"" to speak of.  The staff was very friendly and the room was clean although fairly noisy due to passing traffic..  So, this is perfect for short stays or if you are going to be out and about most of the time and just need a place to sleep and shower and enjoy the savings over more expensive lodging.

12 helpful votes,9 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Overall Good,"We spent 1 night, I picked this hotel based on our TripAdvisor reviews. At checkin there was a small discrepancy in our reservation, not a big deal but since it cost me an extra $15 it was a bit irritating. Despite that though, I would stay here again but come prepared for a few inconveniences. The property owners are definitely working to establish a nice hotel with repeat business and I think theyâ€™re on the right track.  Good: â€¢	The room was very clean (kudos to housekeeping who we saw working hard into early evening hours).  â€¢	Pretty landscaping in garden area and we saw others working hard actually scrubbing sidewalk areas. You can tell they take pride in the property, â€¢	The inroom fridge is surprisingly big and works great. Microwave small but works.  â€¢	Room A/C was better",October 2012,none,none,We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such detailed feedback about your stay.
