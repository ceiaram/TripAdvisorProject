The walk is pretty long, so we ended up getting Ubers (about $6USD each way) which was fine and there were plenty around. It was definitely more than $6 cheaper than the other closer Disneyland accommodation so that is a win right there.  The rooms were nice and spacious, however the floors were very dirty. The wooden floorboards looked nice and clean, but if you walk around in socks for 5 minutes you will quickly realise they are not. TV has plenty of channels with good quality signal and they bathrooms were of a good size. There is also a couple of vending machines with snacks and cold drinks if you needed that.

We could even see the fireworks perfectly from the hotel balcony. It was also great to have a quick bite to eat with the continental breakfast before heading out to Disney.  Most importantly, we must praise the honesty of housekeeping. We left behind a substantial amount of money, about $400 in the room upon check out. It had fallen out of our pocket under the bed skirt. We didn't realize it until we were almost to Arizona. We phoned the Hotel and they called us in about an hour to tell us they found our cash.

That said there were a couple of good things like the breakfast and the lobby. First was not told I would have to pay up front for the room and give a $75 deposit and pay for parking. The room itself was not very clean, there were hairs everywhere; the bed, towels and bathroom. The website said it was newly renovated but it seems like they only did the outside and the lobby. The shower was just painted over, the furniture was all scratched up and chipped. I assume they don't pay the maids as the room didn't even look like it had been vacuumed, my sons socks turned black from the carpet.
