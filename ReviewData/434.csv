77 helpful votes,158 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hotel and lovely pool and service,"After a short stay I have to say was dreading leaving this hotel. As solo traveler it was a great hotel to base yourself. On the last day I had a late checkout. Isabelle on reception mentioned using the pool which was an excellent idea to relax before the long trip home. I had only arrived at the pool to be greeted by a lovely lady, Chandra. She was ever so helpful and welcoming. Her customer service was excellent. Made sure I had everything I needed. Highly recommended. Thank You for your wonderful hospitality.",January 2019,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,434
7 helpful votes,8 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice budget friendly place,"Stayed at this hostel for three nights for my visit to Disneyland. The place is beautiful and clean. The reception guy was friendly.   Met few interesting solo travelers while there. There were snacks like cup noodles and chips provided for a very reasonable price. That was savior after a long day.   One star less is because it was difficult to identify the place for a first times. I didn't have a car, so the cab guys found it difficult to locate the entrance which is a bit interior from parking lot. A clear signage and lighting would have been helpful.   The place isn't really close to Disneyland (same this is mention on their website). costed me an average of $20 for one way cab.",August 2017,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,434

17 helpful votes,102 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Not Quite LA proper but handy enough!,The hostel feels a little out of the way. But we had a car so it wasn't too much of a hassle. People we met outside of the hostel kept telling us we were in Orange County rather than LA! It's close to Disney though and the Angels ground.   We caught public transport to the Dodgers game which was great on the way there but we had to leave the game early to get the last train back.   It took us (car) about 30 - 40mins to get to Newport and Huntington beaches and 1hr to get to universal studios.   It's a quiet hostel but very clean and the staff are nice. In terms of money significantly cheaper than anywhere else we looked but perhaps that was outweighed by location.,August 2016,none,Traveled with friends,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,434
none,5 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great place to stay at a very reasonable price!,"Everything from the check in process to the staff, rooms, and amenities were top notch! It can be a bit tricky to find but very worth it once you find it! Great location, close to downtown Fullerton and Disneyland. Breakfast was provided which was an awesome perk, and if you brought your own food there was a full kitchen. Bathrooms were shared but very clean, and dorms had air conditioning as well as sheets and blankets. Staff was super friendly and very helpful in finding somewhere to eat in Fullerton!!",July 2016,none,Traveled with friends,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,434
1 helpful vote,5 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Quaint, home-like hostel","It is a bit of an effort to get to this hostel which is at the top of a hill, but it is well worth it.   It was the only hostel I could find at Fullerton and just a bus ride or two from Newport Beach. A quaint, home-like hostel that is less dormitory style (even though rooms have bunk beds) and more quiet retreat. It is basically a refurbished home. The kitchen is like one in a family home - and ingredients are available to make pancakes in the morning!    The girl at reception was very nice and offered me an address in newport beach where I could store my luggage so that I wouldn't have to commute all the way from Fullerton to access my stuff.

20 helpful votes,76 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best Accommodation in Fullerton,"Yes, it seems a little bit off the beaten track but in fact it's only 7-10 minutes walk to the nearest restaurants. Mid town is further but a bus from behind Ralph's Supermarket will get you to midtown and Anaheim.  There is Greyhound Station in Anaheim so you don't need to go back to LA if you're going to Vegas because if you do, you'll end up back thru Anaheim. It's about 12 min walk from the main drag to the bus station. Look it up before you set out so that you find it.  The same bus route will drop you off outside Disneyland too.  Now as far as Fullerton Hostel goes, the staff are very friendly and helpful and it's a great place to stay if you want to just relax, especially during summer because the AC provides relief from the searing heat outside.

Plenty of food/supply stores nearby.  Nice area for walk/run. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff. Building well kept. If you are staying in a dorm consider bringing an extension cord or power strip. I don't know about female dorm but the men's didn't have central air, just a fan and conditioning box. It's only open in the summer. Off the beaten path.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great, quiet and friendly hostel, not so good location","I found this hostel on the HI website and thought I'd give it a go. My main reason for coming to LA was to go the theme parks (Disneyland in particular). The hostel staff were wonderful, very friendly and happy to help. Hostel was very clean and well appointed. Beds were sturdy & didn't creak when you moved in them. Kitchen facilities were good. They even have cook your own pancakes each morning which is a novel idea! This hostel is only open during the summer break.   If you are looking for a quiet hostel away from the hustle and bustle of LA then this is the one for you. The only downside is that you have to walk up a dark hill at night and the location is a bit out of the way of Downtown LA (about 1 hr by public transport).

It is situated in the hills of Fullerton next to the regional park and has hiking trails start right from the hostel (but watch out for very fast mountain bikers on those trails). Atmosphere at that hostel is great, stuff is friendly and helpful.

3 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Home from home,"As we appraoched the hostel, we were rather cautious as it was in quite a rural, random location, but as soon as we entered, we couldn't help but smile. The 'take the bag off your back, you're here now, relax' welcome was just what we needed after a 12hour coach trip. The  hostel has only three rooms I think, all coed, and a living room and kitchen. From the outside it looked like a log cabin at night with twinkly fairy lights, and the sound of crickets. The few staff who work/live at the hostel were fantastic-wonderful if you're a bit home sick-it's like being part of a family! The only down side was that we were there in 101degree heat, and so the bedroom was a little hot on one of the nights before we realised there WAS air conditioning!
