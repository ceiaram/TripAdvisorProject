1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,When people say don’t come to this place- literally don’t stay here,"This place is terrible. To be specific with the main office. My friend and I checked in there and the lady at the main guest said specifically no visitors. There was no warning on the site where we booked this motel. We tried getting a refund, but she said that wasn’t possible. We had friends in town and had already asked if they could meet us there ASAP so we can go out for the night. As our 2 other friends were helping us move our stuff in the motel room (we were 2nd floor, stairs only- a lot to carry) the lady went up to us as we were in my car and asked us why we had 2 ppl more ppl staying at the room we were at. I felt extremely uncomfortable because she started questioning us as we were just settling in. Our other 2 friends were only helping us move our things upstairs.

none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Modest Price for Above Average Quality,"I've stayed here a few times this last year and the quality is actually quite high compared to what I've witnessed at other hotels in the area.  I'll grant it's no 5-Star resort, but if you're looking for a place to spend a night rather than driving 20-hours, this is a good location.  Also, the staff are quite committed to your safety (and sense of safety).  Another guest started throwing a party and their 'guests' were knocking on other doors.  The staff had them removed immediately after it was reported (literally minutes).  So they earned this 4-star review. Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.  I'll grant they were made by the people who were kicked out.",August 2017,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,448

Check-in took triple regular time.  Then the door lock was substandard, so I stacked chairs and suitcases to block the door while I slept.  Everthing was so old it was threadbare.  I swear they got the furniture from Salvation Army.  The carpet was 30 years old.  The mattress was 20 years old, and perfect contour if you are a banana.  Not so good for humans though.  No blankets, and sheets you can see through.  The bathrooms have not seen clorox in quite a while.  The shower curtain was 10 years old at least.  The showerhead was encrusted in old calcium deposits.  The curtain rod was rusty.  Only 2 towels, minimum size that cant fit all the way around your waist.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't stay here,"Not only is this the dirtiest place I have ever stayed at, but the staff is extremely rude to say the least. We came back from Disney at 11 pm to find our room key had been cancelled all because our friend met us there in the morning. We were told if we had another guest over we would be kicked out (even though they knew it was our last night). The ""free"" wifi doesn't work. We found a spider in our bathroom and a beetle came crawling out from under our bed. The rooms do NOT look like the pictures and building is extremely old.

63 helpful votes,119 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"clean, very friendly, basic motel","The Sky Palm doesn't try to be something it isn't.  It's a basic motel, nothing more.  It's clean and comfortable.  The people who run the place are extremely friendly and pleasant.  As noted by others, you get two bottles of cold water or soda when you check in, welcome on a hot day.  One unusual thing--it's an outdoor motel, but kind of ethereal music is piped throughout the parking lot.  The surroundings seemed reasonably safe, but be forewarned--there are no electronic locks on the doors, just good old fashioned keys.  And the room had a bit of a musty smell to it, especially with the A/C on--one call to the desk produced a can of Lysol to spray around which helped immensely.",August 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,16,448
