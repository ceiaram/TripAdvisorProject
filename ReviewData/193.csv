The amenities,  beautiful bathroom, phonograph & records and most importantly, excellent comfortable mattress went above and beyond what we expected. The food and beverage service was outstanding, and we immensely enjoyed our fabulous breakfast - both in taste and presentation. We’ll surely be back for a longer stay in the near future.

There is parking which my husband and I loved because we drive up from San Diego and hate the meter parking on the streets. We immediately grabbed one of their delicious cocktails at the bar and were taken to our GORGEOUS room with the perfect ocean view. We hung out on the property all night and got to dine at their lovely and quaint restaurant. The chef greeted us at our table after we had tried some of his wonderful food. We could have sat their enjoying ourselves until the sun came up! The pool area is perfect and there is a great little path down to a private beach area across the street.

The hotel is BRAND NEW and the rooms are all different and have their own unique character. The beach is a short walk down the path that leads to Shaw’s Cove and they set up a little area for you to relax on the beach! They also offer yoga on weekend mornings that was so therapeutic and left me feeling physically and mentally relaxed. Loved that they offer that!  Now, for the restaurant...hands down some of the best food I’ve ever had in my life (and I’m a foodie). Chef Leo is INCREDIBLE. The dishes he makes are so flavorful, presented beautifully, and truly exceptional. Even if you don’t stay here, you should definitely dine here!

Our room was incredible with a Ocean view, bathroom was gorgeous with a beautiful tub, bed was super comfortable and the adorable record player to play music and enjoy our champagne. The restaurant Saline was incredible, we enjoyed some signature drinks, had some yummy appetizers followed by our main course which was to die for. Our waitress was so sweet and our favorite part was the Chef coming and talking with us about our meal. We then enjoyed some wine by the fire place. When we woke, we were surprised to have coffee delivered. Yoga on the grass was really neat. Again, we were blown away with breakfast, the menu is fantastic.

Just received an email this morning that there was a ""glitch"" in the reservation system that booked two people in the same room at the same time, so the solution they came up with was to cancel my reservation.  Just like that.  There was no offer of putting me in another room, or extending the same rate for another room that same weekend, even though when I went online later to check, and the website showed other rooms available.  Totally absurd and ridiculous.  Incredibly unprofessional and lame.  The only way I found out about this hotel was as a referral from a sister property in Palm Springs - Korakia Pensione - which I stay at often.  But this experience soured me on both properties and I don't see myself making a reservation at",September 2018,none,none,"Hi Matt,   Thank you for your feedback and for reaching out. I am so sorry that you feel your interaction with us was mismanaged – we are so disappointed. I agree that we should have reached out to you via phone and discussed other options first, and do apologize that didn’t happen.    We truly hope that you will give us another opportunity in the future to show you how special Hotel Joaquin is. As you may have experienced at our sister property, a positive and enjoyable guest experience is the most important amenity that we offer. We really cherish our guests and want them to feel taken care of, so hope to make this right.    Thank you for your outreach and understanding.",none,none,none,none,none,none,135,193
