However, there is an unsettling lack of privacy. In the room the sliding bathroom door doesnt meet the door frame so it didn't lock. This isn't such a big deal if like me you're just staying in a room with your husband and infant but otherwise might be an issue. The bigger issue was the doors to the hall and the room next to ours. Both doors had a significant gap between the bottom of the door and the floor. This meant every single sound was clearly audible. Every time someone walked down the hall we could hear even the lightest steps and any talking from our neighbors sounded like we were in the same room.

I didn't explore too much, but from what I saw, there were a lot of restaurants and some shopping available very nearby. There's a Starbucks across the street. The location is so convenient, just take the La Paz exit (I think 89?) off I-5, turn right and it's the first right.
