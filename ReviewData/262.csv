This is a smoke free hotel and yet there are cigarette butts all around the property.  When I checked in at 3 it smelled like smoke around my room. Went to a party and came back at 11pm and the smoke smell was horrible.  I told the front desk but these ""kids"" didn't seem to care. This is supposedly a smoke free hotel.

The air conditioner never got the room cool enough and the sink was very slow to drain but that is fairly minor.  A standard spread at breakfast, nothing special but did the job. Basically, a solid Quality Inn, nothing to rave about but no major issues either. Good enough for me. One thing that was curious. My room was prepaid, but I am used to hotels taking a credit card imprint for incidentals. Most don't actually run it and place a hold on $ on your credit card.  These folks did and it was a $100 hold. For incidentals. That seems awfully high to me and I recognize it will drop off eventually but is a nuisance in the meantime.
