Upon checking in we thought the place would be fine. The staff were super friendly and they were happy to give us a ""no smoking"" room adjoining the other family we were traveling with. But walking into the room was a completely different story. We requested two doubles but upon opening the door u feel like u are in Toon Town and looking in on a miniature house. The beds are tiny. They are probably 6 inches wider than a twin bed, but I could be being generous. The bed spreads were obviously stained and u could tell that they hadn't been freshly laundered at all because the stains looked fresh.

While attempting to get inside of the room to retrieve our belongings, we found that my key had been deactivated. I explained to the front desk that we were tired and needed to shower but there was no consideration for me or the kids.

This place was horrible.  Yes, it was inexpensive compared to other hotels closer to Disneyland, but from the minute I parked, I knew I'd made the wrong decision.  There were what appeared to be homeless people milling around the property.  I could smell pot as I walked to our room and I was afraid for my kids staying the night there.  I figured I'd tough it out since we had no other choice and we'd only be there a few hours to sleep between trips to Disney parks.  It was supposed to have been newly renovated.  I saw no evidence of that.  The carpet was filthy.  The room was stuffy, all the moisture from everything was held in the room.  There",July 2012,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,51,179

The beds are typical discount beds so you know what to expect, nothing fancy.  When we pulled down the comforter to get in bed, there was a candy wrapper and little hairs all in the sheets.  Gross!  It was like the sheets had not been changed from the previous guest, only made up to look like it.  We called the front desk and housekeeping came up promptly to change the sheets even though it was close to 10pm.  That part was good at least.
