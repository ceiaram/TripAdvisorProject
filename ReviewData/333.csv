1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst hotel stay in a Marriott branded hotel,"My sister, sister in law and myself stayed at this hotel from April 17 to April 21, 2021.  We had several issues while staying there and have reached out to Marriott to discuss with no response other than an email saying the hotel would contact me.  That was more than two weeks ago and no one has contacted us which is the reason for a negative review.  I am a titanium elite lifetime member and can honestly say this was the worst hotel stay ever in a Marriott branded hotel.  Upon checkin they could not find the reservation, when it was finally found none of the notes that had been put on my reservation were even looked at.  Our room was not ready, after receiving a text that it was, so they said they would call my cell phone when it was ready.  Did not happen.

We sincerely apologize for the issues that you experienced during your stay. I have spoken with the staff members at the front desk to ensure that all promises are kept and calls placed when rooms are initially not available. In regards to the water shut-off, it was our intention that every room be notified in advance regarding the repairs and planned the event to occur mid-day to minimize the impact on our guests. Clearly you were not notified and that is unacceptable. This will not happen again on any future improvement projects and the team will make sure to over communicate rather than risk even one guest not knowing about an event. Per our Covid policies, we do offer limited housekeeping service (every 3 days)  but your room should have been serviced even with limited water on Tuesday. I will research with the housekeeping department to determine why this was not done. The Residence Inn is committed to providing an outstanding experience for each of our guests and we apologize that we failed during your stay.

8 helpful votes,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very clean place to stay & near Disney,"We have just returned from spending 5 days at this particular Residence Inn while we were on vacation in California.  The hotel is very well maintained and the front desk staff was very friendly.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom/ 2 bathroom suite to accomodate myself,my husband, my sister-in-law & my 2 small children (age 4 & 5 months).  The room was clean and the maid service was also impeccable.  The pool area was very nice with an outdoor pool & spa.  We did use both.  We were disappointed to find that the pool was not heated as we happened to be there when it was in the upper 80's but the pool was much too cold to enjoy.  The spa though nice was crowded with people as no one in the complex wanted to use the pool as it was too cold.  But spending time mostly outside the hotel, this",February 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,170,333

Our choice was the Residence Inn in Los Alamitos, CA, (called Residence Inn Cypress) about six miles from our home.  Both my wife and I were very happy with every aspect of the hotel.  We had reserved a studio suite for three nights using Marriott Reward points and paid for the fourth night which was $109.00.  Check in was fast and friendly.  We received a ground floor room as requested.  Our suite was #122.  In addition to the room rate, there was a $100.00 charge for our pets.  The studio suite was beautiful!  It had a well equipped kitchen with full size refrigerator/freezer/ice maker, microwave, electric range, and dishwasher.  There was a dining table for",November 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,171,333

I really preferred the original design of Residence Inn a long time ago, with all the separate 2 story buildings, but since those are no longer being built I'm happy to report that the rooms are still as nice.   The continental breakfast in the morning is really more than it's name - there were plenty of hot items and it's easy to fill up on the selections.  This is no cheap orange juice and donuts type spread; it's a little of everything. My only complaint with this property was that the front desk staff was not at all professional.  Just a bunch of kids goofing off while getting guests checked in and out.  Not a big deal, but not the impression Marriott is going for, I'm sure.",May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,172,333
7 helpful votes,7 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A great hotel between Long Beach and Disneyland,"We stayed in the Residence Inn for two nights before taking our cruise out of San Pedro.  Great location to everything without having to be on the freeways.  It it so near to Long Beach, Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, etc.  It is almost next door to Costco's and near to some  grocery stores (Ralph's).  Having been in RI's before, we found this one up the the high standards we expect them to be. We especially loved the weeknight meals and breakfasts.  The room was nice and quiet.  Did not use the pool as it was too cold outside (major winter storm).  Staff was helpful and friendly.  We had a problem with the safe and it took a maintenance man to come to the office and open it back up to get my documents out of it.  The Internet worked with my computer making it good to get our",March 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,173,333

9 helpful votes,3 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great place to stay!,A great place to stay while in Los Angeles/Anaheim area! We had five adults and we fit nicely in the two bedroom suite with sofa bed. Staff was excellent and always friendly. Went the extra mile with us first night there offering us tickets to Jay Leno that another guest was unable to use. Breakfast buffet was plentiful and great selection of foods. Nice court yard area to relax in. Quiet place to stay in a great location. Close to Disneyland and Knotts Berry Farm. Would definately stay there again!

4 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I like Residence Inns !,"Friendly staff. Always saying ""hi"", etc. EZ to check-in. Quick check-out.  When car battery died, front desk staff responded within 5 minutes (she drove her personal auto to where we were parked) and jump-started my car.  Maid only left towels for 4 people (my family has 5 people), so I left her a note. For the rest of the visit, we had plenty of towels.  The pool was extremely clean, but too cold to swim in. Jacuzzi was fine. Sometimes, there were not enough towels in the pool area, so had to ask front desk to send some out. Within 5 minutes, there were towels out by the pool.  Great breakfast every morning. Great munchies in the evenings (M-Tu-W-Th only).  Love the mini kitchen. We save money by making meals in our hotel suite, instead of going to a restaurant.
