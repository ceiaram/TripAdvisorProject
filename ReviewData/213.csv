I would like to inform you, the guest with a car in question was notified to remove the vehicle once we were told by you that there is an unauthorized car parked on the accessible parking spots. My understanding is that our staff was able to find you a parking spot close to your room.  We take pride in informing you that our hotel was awarded by TripAdvisor and other 3rd part travel websites for being the cleanest property. As part of our daily quality cleaning routine, our dedicated housekeeping supervisor inspects the room before renting them. After reading your reviews, i can tell we did miss few check-marks, and please be assured your feedback has been shared with our concerned department. All our room has Simmons beauty rest mattresses, which is one of the top-notch mattresses available in the market with 5-star rating. However, we do understand some things are not for everyone.  Our hotel understands the importance of quality sleep and, based on the same reasoning, and we have double panel noise cancellation windows installed in all our rooms.  I have to disagree with your comments regarding water being bad, orange county is one of the only states which has a dedicated groundwater replenishment system, which provides clean water throughout the county; however, we do offer complimentary water bottles for each room, and extra water can also be availed at the front-desk 24X7.

The big complaint I have was with the free complimentary breakfast.  The cereal, yogurt, waffle maker, etc, was all fine (hard to screw that up), but the sausage and powdered scrambled eggs were SO DISGUSTING!!!  dont even dare eat it.  the sausage was something I wouldn't feed a stray dog.  there was a long peice of pig artery sticking out of the link I bit into, almost made me throw up.  Come on, how much more would it be to get some half decent breakfast sausage on the table?  The OJ was super sour tasting also, couldn't even drink that as well.

It is crucial in letting us know what we're doing right,and to help us correct any areas where we've come up short.  I apologize for any dissatisfaction you had during your stay with us. In regards to your room, we're on a first come first served basis. This also applies to reservations as well. At that time we were using a new cleaner/deodorizer, and regretfully the housekeeper that serviced your room wasn't clear on the need to let the room air for a time before shutting the door and window.  We have since made sure to re instruct all staff. For parking, we do have dedicated    handicapped spots as required by law. Our pool is kept at 75º to 80º year round. The spa is 100º to 103º. Reference the noisy patrons, we encourage all guests to inform the staff at any hour, so we can maintain a peaceful environment for all to enjoy. The same goes for any issue,including a malfunctioning TV remote. I'm also sorry for your displeasure with our complimentary wine... we serve it daily and have had no complaints thus far.
