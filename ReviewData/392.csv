We are SO happy we did! What a charming, friendly, convenient, clean, and pleasant place to stay.  Our vacation got off to a rough start with a surprise blizzard in Vancouver that almost cancelled our flight. After a long day of frustrating travel my credit card wouldn’t work (even though it was empty and I had advised the bank of our travel dates).

The new rooms were great.  Breakfast was still great.  The pool area was still great.  The grounds were still beautiful - even for February.  Housekeeping is still a tad slow (we left our room one day for 11 hours and came back and it still hadn't been serviced), but I give them a pass on that one since I suspect they are understaffed like many hotels/motels.  My only issue with the new changes at the Candy Cane was the change to the free shuttle to the park.

This place is definitely not keeping up with the times, though their prices are. We have stayed here for years and years, and I think that our last time will indeed be our last time here. Partly because our family is getting older and our family of four can no longer fit in these rooms.  Even the deluxe room that we rented this past trip does not provide what we need.   The parking lot has seemingly been made to accommodate more cars, however, I am wondering if this was done by making the existing spaces smaller.

It's an easy walk to the park tho they offer FREE shuttle. Note the free in that statement. They also have free wireless and parking. These are things the big hotels charge for. Everyone is incredibly friendly and the rooms are clean and spacious (we had premium room).

Hot tub is merely warm but pretty typical for a hotel. It's pretty quiet in the room.

The continental breakfast is disappointing (white bread toast, sugary yogurts and spotted bananas), but nothing unexpected. The hot tub unfortunately closes at 11pm, so you have to miss the final fireworks show if you want to soak your aching body at the end of the day. Otherwise it's great. Easy walk to Disneyland for adults and teens (a bit far for kiddies), and a regular shuttle (although the drivers run the AC bordering on freezing). I wouldn't call it a luxury vacation spot, but the bed is comfortable, the coffee in the room is yummy, and there is a high-end fan/AC/heater.

The positives: The beds were wonderful,with thick mattresses and even thicker pillows.  The grounds were gorgeous, with cobblestone driveway and abundant plant life.  The pool area was beautiful and fluffy towels were provided at poolside, which was so helpful.  The location to the park was perfect and the free shuttle was prompt and very clean.

I look for places like the Candy Cane Inn which I might never have found. It is a true gem in a field full of choices. Our stay was for 4 days, 3 nights in a premium room. We had 3 kids with us - 16, 15, and 8. Our room was cozy (with a rollaway), but it was manageable, and the little extras were appreciated - the bottles of water, the coffee, tea and biscotti, and the refrigerator itself. The breakfast delivered to our room was our wake up call each morning, and the pool/hot tub was a great way to end a busy day. We spent 2 full days at Disneyland, and felt the proximity of the hotel was ideal. Close enough to walk, but a great shuttle if you needed it.

Our only problem was one mentioned often on this site: kids on the second floor running up and down stairs endlessly.  We tolerated one group of kids for two hours, then called and complained.  The running soon stopped.  Our room was very near the hotel's laundry area; and, thus, often populated with hotel staff -- staff who should have counseled the children to stop running.

She wanted to stay somewhere with a cool name so we picked the Candy Cane Inn. We loved every minute of it there. We spent as much time there as we did at the parks.  The service was great. One of us ended up getting sick and the front desk helped us with finding the hospital and then when we got back they made sure we were comfortable. They went far beyond what they had to.  The pool and hot tub were perfect for resting our feet for the next day. My only suggestion is to run the shuttle a little later because we liked to shop in downtown and didn't have much time after the parks closed to shop because we had to be there to catch the next shuttle.,March 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2862,392
