It's definitely an old-school style motel with parking right out front and small rooms in single story building, just off the main road.

I was mortified when my housekeeper asked if I had remembered to replace the seat and ran right to your room and knocked, you had already left, that is when I called you.  I can only, wholeheartedly, apologize about the lack of toilet seat. That is certainly not a frill or amenity that you should have to ask about when making reservations. I assure you, the toilets have seats (when I am not having a brain freeze!)  The courtyard rules are that the guests be in and fire out by 11:30, the guests were compliant that evening.    I completely understand your discontent and am, again, very sorry. If you had let me know, rather than suffering through without a toilet seat, I assure you I would have taken care of it.
