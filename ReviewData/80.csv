The agreement that was signed by the group representative listed that ""quiet time is from 10:00 pm until 9:00 am"" and that ""we require constant adult supervision"". Oftentimes, we had unattended children causing great disturbance to other guests as early as 7:10 am and as late as 11 pm. As a result, a handful of our team members had to stay past their scheduled work hours. The signed agreements also stated that ""Any trash left in common areas must be cleaned up"".

With the Trip Advisor rating I was expecting a better experience. This hotel is dated and service was mediocre.  The room was very dated, the tv was small and the remote didn't work. The bed was very firm and the bedding was not that soft or comfortable. Sadly, I felt like I was a chain restaurant off the freeway in the middle of nowhere, not a hotel that tries to project an air of luxury and comfort.  The staff was ok, some staff were friendly others were simply unaware of guests standing in front of the counter or were ignoring the guests.

The hotel is conveniently located (just be aware that it's right off of the 241 tollroad, so that could be confusing), clean and the staff is very helpful.  The bathroom/vanity areas are a bit small, and tight.  In order to close and/or open the bathroom door, the other person needed to leave the vanity area.   The closet doors weren't set properly, so it was hard to get things in and out.  We enjoyed the complimentary (full, not continental) breakfast each morning!
