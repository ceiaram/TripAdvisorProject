On the way, I requested an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite with a bunkbed, which my kids loved.  The 1 bedroom would've been ok, but I was so happy that they got us into the 2 bedroom, which just gave us more room to breathe.  It's a three room space, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and then a kitchen/living room with pullout couch. The pool and hot tubs look really nice.  The breakfast is huge and has everything you could need.  There's a CVS in the same parking lot, so if you need any supplies you have them too.  And Disneyland is a 10 min walk!  You could really go there and back throughout the day if you needed.

The rooms are nice sized and allowed us to let family members sleep while others got up and had coffee. The breakfast is such a nice perk of this hotel. The staff works so hard to keep everything stocked and ready for guests. The front desk staff was willing to answer questions and help with any request. The walking distance to Disneyland was great. It only took 10-15 minutes depending on the light and crowds. There are many restaurant options close to the hotel. We used the hot tub one night, and it was a nice break from the park.

It's like Marriott knows what families need, so they built this hotel. Not having to stay all in one room=amazing! A fantastic breakfast included- even better! Walking distance to Disneyland- sweet! You get so much bang for your buck here compared to other hotels. I was amazed they had a room ready for us when we arrived hours early and they gave us an extra hour for late checkout. This allowed us to take the time to use their laundry facility before we boarded our cruise. The laundry room is such a great amenity! All of the hotel staff were super friendly.

Rooms are tidy, overall interior feels at par with what you pay. Mattresses are 7/10 for hotel standards. Shower has swift temperature changes for no reason.

I would probably stay there again for the cleanliness, value, and space.  - We has a queen suite. It was a good size but a couple of things to note: The doors to the bathroom and bedroom and sliding barn doors. The doors are mainly frosted glass, so it doesn’t really work to have the kiddos go to sleep in the bedroom and watch TV in the living room (if the lights are on in the living room, it is light in the bedroom). Same goes with the bathroom, if someone gets up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and turns on the light, the light will go through the door to the bedroom and wake people up. -The shower is clear glass and there is not a separate space for the toilet.

I am very sorry for the troubles that you encountered during your visit.    Please accept my apology for the fact that the staff was not as friendly or as responsive as they needed to be.  I have followed up with the team members you have mentioned by name to discuss how we can do better in the future.  As far as room locations are concerned, we have 3 categories of views/locations in the hotel - standard, high floor/city view and theme park/Disney.  From what I can see on your reservation, you reserved a standard view/location room.  I also see that you requested a high floor.  Unfortunately, high floor/premium views are in high demand, especially in the peak summer travel season.  We do everything in our power to accommodate requests, but the premium locations do tend to sell out quickly this time of year so it is best to reserve them in advance.  While we were not able to place you on the 9th floor, I am pleased to see that we at least were able to find you a room on a mid level (5th floor) as opposed to a ground level room.    I am sorry to hear about your daughter's mirror.  While it's whereabouts remain a mystery, I would be happy to research this further should you have any additional specific details to provide that could give us an indication as to where it might be.  As mentioned above, I have spoken to the team about ensuring that they should the right amount of friendliness and concern in situations such as this one.  Finally, please accept my apology about the tough time you had with parking.  Please be assured that the number of parking spaces at the hotel actually exceeds the minimum standard required for our size property.

I am glad that you like the facilities overall, though I do understand you frustration with pricing. With our location being adjacent to the Anaheim Convention Center and directly across the street from Disneyland, the vast majority of our guests are visiting one of those two destinations. As such, like in most heavy tourist/convention markets, there can be large fluctuations in rates depending on the season or the timing of events in the area. This makes it especially tricky to price potential corporate accounts as these are usually fixed throughout the year. I would encourage you to reach out to our Director of Sales, Jenifer Reihl, who may be able to work with your situation.  I am also sorry to hear that the service has not been meeting your expectations. Without any specifics, I am unable to pinpoint what may have gone wrong, but please feel free to reach out to me personally and I will work to ensure that we improve. Finally, with regards to the protesters in front of the building. This is a bit unusual as their issue is related to a subcontractor associated with the construction of the building; they are not company employees and have not indicated that they have any issues with the management company or the building owners.

One final note concerning our bar.  With most guests in the hotel visiting Disneyland, opening the bar earlier in the afternoon has not been feasible, though we sometimes leave it open later depending on the park hours and expected demand.

I am glad that you enjoyed the overall property design/layout and found our location and proximity to area shopping and services to be great for families.    Naturally, I am disappointed in some of the issues you mentioned.  Concerning our housekeeping service, needless to say, not having your room cleaned on any day, let alone four of them is not acceptable.  Please accept my apology for this.  While we have only been open a short time, our room cleanliness satisfaction scores have been amongst then highest in the brand, so I believe that this is not indicative of the level of service we normally provide.  Without knowing the details of your visit, it will be difficult to trace the issue fully, but I assure you that I will sit down with the head of our housekeeping department and discuss what may have gone wrong and how we can avoid situations such as this one in the future.   Being a hotel specially designed for families in a resort market, we have made a few adjustments to our offerings in order to better serve the predominate visitors to the Disneyland Resort area.  Several of these changes involve our food and beverage department.  As you noted, our hotel does not offer The Mix, which has been replaced with a full service bar and the soon to open Pizza Hut Express.  We have done our best to ensure that the fact that we do not offer The Mix has been noted on our website and have additional scripting that appears at the top of the booking screen on the Marriott.com website.   If per chance we have missed something, I would be grateful if you would reach out to me personally so that we can make corrections as needed.  We are currently working on adjusting the verbiage for the Pizza Hut Express to indicate that it will be coming soon (we expect it to open by the end of October).  I am very sorry for the confusion with this.     With regards to our Disneyland view rooms, I am disappointed that the view did not meet your expectations.  When determining  which rooms to offer as Disneyland view rooms, we selected only rooms that provide a view of at least one major landmark inside the park such as Space Mountain or the Matterhorn, with those rooms also having largely unobstructed views of the park’s popular seasonal fireworks displays.  While it is true that the backdrop for Cars Land is large, it is to the west of the hotel and does not block the landmarks mentioned above or the fireworks from any of the designated Disneyland view rooms.  It is our belief that these rooms offer clearer views of the park of than most in the area and thus far we have received a great deal of positive feedback from guests about these rooms.

We arrived in the empty parking garage around 1:30pm and attempted to check in a hour and a half early.  No such luck.  I guess everyone must shuttle in.  So we slept in our car until 3:00pm then checked into Room 737. The room was large enough for the four of us.  No view whatsoever but that didn't bother us as we would be at Disneyland the majority of our time.  I looked around the room and noticed a hair on top of the kitchen table.  Then two in the shower, one on the bathroom counter top and finally one on top of the closed toilet lid.

Considering this property has only been open 2 weeks, I'm very impressed.... There are employees that need more training and more engaging with guests..BUT  they are doing a great job considering. The only suggestion I can make is that the flat screen TV in the living room area cannot be turned towards the kitchen or directed at all.  You need to be sitting right in front of it or you can't watch it.. Please don't tell anybody because it will get crowded and expensive...LOL",August 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,600,72

Ceilings were open in Lobby/breakfast area with construction workers still working on them.  2. Alarm at front desk was going off every couple of mins for the 3 days we were there; difficult to speak with front desk over.  3. Our first room had electrical issues. The dishwasher, outlets, and most importantly air conditioning didn't work. Opened the electrical panel and breakers were missing and area only covered with tape stating dangerous don't touch hand written in it.  4. Electrical socket by pool area open and exposed for a kid to stick their fingers in (alerted a maintenance guy in the hallway immediately of the issue) 5. 2nd room: back splashes had not been caulked on the wall; just sitting there you could pick them up.

We are glad that you chose to stay with us for your vacation to the Anaheim Resort Area and sincerely apologize that we were unable to provide you with an exceptional experience.   Being a brand new hotel, there have been a few items which we have discovered that required immediate attention in order to better service our guests. Like you have mentioned in your review, some of those items included the ceiling panels in the breakfast buffet, the electrical/construction issues you encountered in your guest rooms, and the hot water which was shut off for an emergency repair. Although numerous tests are run prior to opening and welcoming our first guests, not everything can be discovered until we are running and operating at a high occupancy with most guest rooms filled.   Rest assured we have worked vigorously to have these issues corrected, in an effort to continue to improve our services. We hope to have an opportunity to better your experience with us, should your travels bring you back to Anaheim.  Sincerely, Raul E. Assistant General Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,601,72

I believe this hotel only recently opened and I could have been the first person to stay in the room. Fantastic kitchen - wanted to take it home with me.

This place is right next door to the Anaheim Convention Center and within walking distance of Disneyland as well. Even though Trip Advisor says this is the former Anaheim Jolly Roger Hotel, it is a brand new building built from the ground up! I stayed here on the 10th day of operation. Here is my biggest issue which will cause me not to return again unless the situation is rectified. There is no work space (desk) or ergonomic chair. I was told to I could use the kitchen bar that have bar stools that maybe come up to the lower lumbar of my back. Sitting for more then hour this way was not acceptable! I was stunned that a Residence Inn that caters to long term travelers would not have a desk or proper desk chair. The",August 2016,none,none,"Dear TravelingMan5989,  Thank you for visiting out new hotel and for taking the time to share your experience with us.  I am sorry to hear that the room configuration did not meet your needs.  While Residence Inn properties typically have large workstations in the rooms, our location is a custom-built property geared towards the predominate visitors to the area, such as the vacationing families you mentioned.  I am very sorry for any lack of clarity on the part of our website.  My team will review the items you mentioned to ensure that all of our information is correct in the system.    As to the size of the rooms, there is indeed a wide variety of sizes and styles to choose from, such as studios, one bedrooms, larger suites with a separate sleeping area that includes bunk beds and a kids sized bathroom with a tub.  We also have a small number of 1200+ sq. ft. two bedroom executive suites.  Additionally, some of our rooms have spectacular views of the city or theme parks.  Those smaller rooms you mentioned have floor to ceiling windows with many of them offering some of the best views in the hotel.     While I cannot change the fact that our rooms do not have the workspace you desire, we do offer a number of business friendly amenities, included a business/work center in the lobby with ergonomic chairs, outstanding WIFI coverage throughout the rooms, lobby and expansive pool area, a boardroom available through our sales office and, of course, we are directly next door to the Anaheim Convention Center.  If you do choose to stay with us again, we would be happy to provide a work chair for use in your room.  We will also look in to ways that we can learn from your experience and make changes to better suit the needs of travelers like yourself.  Thank you again for sharing your feedback with us.

Room was great with large kitchen and separate lounge area. Great TVs. Large bathroom, excellent shower, large comfortable bed. Nice range of food available at breakfast (loved the make your own waffles), but this got very busy at peak times and food ran out. One morning there were no forks! The pool area was good, but lack of shade available. Cons: as mentioned, breakfast could be a bit of a scrum. They need more staff on replenishing food and clearing tables. Also our room was very noisy - we were in a corner room with the 4 lane road on one side and a building site on the other. They start work very early in Anaheim! Finally, the room cleaning was hit & miss. Some days it",August 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,604,72
