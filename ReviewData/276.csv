The room doors have 2 locks. One of the two was a deadlock which didn't actually lock. It would just spin in place. It's right next to the street, so depending, can be kind of loud with people walking by, or cars zooming by. The bathroom was extremely nice and clean, that was probably the best part of the room  if we're being honest. It's super, super close to the beach. Literally about a 5 minute walk.

The rooms are adequate sized with a roomy tiled shower and bathroom skylight to brighten-up the day and make up for the lack of back wall windows.

It was our first time out in California, and we wanted to have a night on the ocean.  The location of the hotel could not be more perfect.  The pier and Main Street are a 5 minute walk away.  The beach is right across the street, and the excellent deck provides a great view of everything.  The deck was also the perfect location for my wife and I to relax while the kids went to sleep in the room.  Right next door you can find a 7-11 where you can purchase coffee, beer and snacks.

Forgot a bag outside our door and within minutes, they picked it up and returned it, and whenever we ran into them coming and whenever we saw them, they called us by our first names.  There are steps to the 2nd floor where the rooms are located, and they were difficult for my mom, but she was a trooper and made it up and down several times.  We visited our neighbors out on the deck.  We will definitely book it again.  We split our vacation between two motels, and I regret that.  I'll stay at Surf Inn the whole time next visit.

The beds were comfy and they only do room service upon request which I like because I don't like having people go through my room that has my wallet, phone, iPod, etc. The couple that runs it is awesome and were very friendly. The views from the deck at night are beautiful and the location is just phenomenal. Conveniently located next to a cvs and 7/11 and a short walk from Main street, shopping, dining, etc. I will absolutely go back.",May 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,558,276
16 helpful votes,44 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,excellent weekend getaway,Julie and James will take care of whatever you need. We stayed in room 1 and it was spotless and everything worked. Will stay in room 9 next trip. If you are a light sleeper due to lights you do not want room 1 as the outside light will show through the blinds. I do not have that problem and slept just fine in a comfortable bed. It is just a block away from Supreme Donuts for a great cup of coffee early and all the beach activities at the pier are just two more blocks. Our walk North one block from the hotel and cross over there to the beach without the crowds. You will get your moneys worth here and the managers are friendly.,May 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,559,276
4 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I slept with Jimi Hendrix at the Huntington Surf Inn!,"Okay, not really, but the mural of him, Roger and Mick was pretty cool.  My 14 year old daughter and I had a great time and she especially loved the room. It was very clean and the beds were quite comfortable.   Julie and James were terrific.  When our flight was delayed did our family call to check on us to see if we were okay? No. Julie did.  She said she was just checking to make sure we had made it in to HB safely.  So sweet!  Both Julie and James were friendly and helpful with anything we needed.  James even gave me tide information and recommended the best time to surf so I didn't get clobbered by the massive waves on Fri.  We will definitely come back to the Surf Inn.  The only draw back was that the cars on PCH were kind of loud when we were trying to fall asleep at",May 2011,none,none,"Dear JenDawn89,  Clearly you are the winner of the best caption contest :) Thank you so much for the great review.

The Surf Inn was in an awesome location, close to the heart of Huntington there is a good little surf break out from the hotel (less crowded than the pier).  Julie and James were brilliant from the moment we arrived, all the way through to when we left.  We had the end room (furthest from the road) it was large, quiet and comfortable, had everything we needed.  Definitely recommend this place.",May 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,561,276

The rooms are very chic and spotlessly clean. The managers treat everyone like family. The location is perfect. The Inn is right beside the best beach in the area and they have an elevated deck from which you can enjoy a peaceful cup of coffee or evening cocktail while gazing at the sea. If you like an active vacation there is plenty to do. The pier is a ""must""! I saw a pod of dolphin during an early morning stroll. When you get hungry there are loads of restaurants along Main St. to choose from. Oh yeah, and the managers will give you discount coupons to use during your stay. ........I'll be going back in September. You can find me on the deck with a smile on my face!!!",May 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,562,276
10 helpful votes,22 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location~horrible if you're trying to get some sleep!,"The proximity to the Pier, shopping and the ocean were all fantastic!  There was a small refrigerator in the room and a BBQ available for use if we wanted to put something on the grill.  Now the bad news~the window coverings were mini-blinds that allowed the VERY BRIGHT lights from the hotel to stream in our window which meant it looked like it was broad daylight when in fact, it was the middle of the night!.  So, 3 of the 4 of us got next to no sleep!  The other contributing factor to the loss of sleep was the nightlife was loud, loud, loud!  Loud engines from motorcycles and cars were non-stop as were the partiers....so sad to say we won't stay here again.",April 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,563,276

I was on the beach within a few minutes of my arrival. Room 9 was fantastic, with a great view. Also, the materials in this room were ecologically sustainable. The ""green"" nature of the room was inspiring and the integration of the ecological concepts into the room decor by the HGTV Designer Antonio Ballatore was innovative. Service was great.

We stayed in room 7 with the blue-sea painted walls and beautiful over sized paintings. But we could have stayed in the Jimi Hendrix room, or the black room with a crystal chandelier!  The beds and linens were super comfy. The european style bathroom has a huge shower and the towels are not skimpy. The managers were extremely friendly and gave us some pointers for local restaurants and attractions. (my favorite attraction was the roof top deck over looking the Pacific, perfect !)

I had stayed at the best western next door a few years back, however this trip the woman at the front desk couldn't have been less helpful or acted less enthused for my business.  I went accross the street and it was the complete opposite.  Recently under new management and the couple that runs the place couldn't have been more kind to us.  Everything inside and outside the room was clean, the bed was comfy, and the room was well maintained.  The location and the staff is well worth the price (which is cheaper then their next door neighbor), so I would highly recommend the Surf's Inn.
