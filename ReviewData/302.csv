The motel has free parking and is walking distance from Disney, although the #43 and 543 buses stop nearby and are a quick and cheap way to save your feet. There is a small fridge and a microwave in the room, but no cutlery or crockery. We bought some disposable ones from the supermarket as we were trying to eat in to save money, it would’ve been great to have some basics provided. The room itself was dated but clean and tidy; housekeeping was great. The beds were on the hard side but after a long day at Disney, I could’ve slept on the floor for all I cared.

Bed WAY too soft I could not get comfortable at all (and I usually dont mind soft beds).  Worst part the smell. It was horrible. They must have ""renovated"" by painting over mildew. And then they cover up the mold smell with a god awful air freshener. Smelled like old lady's house and mothballs. Really nauseating. When we got home we had to wash all our clothes - even the stuff we did not wear and that were clean - because the smell of the room permeated everything.   Do Not Stay Here At All.

Our beds were always made when we came back to the Hotel.  Manny the manager and family were freindly helpful and very informative.

We booked over expedia, but maybe rates might be better if you can contact the hotel direct, not sure.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, for whoever  is staying in Anaheim Disneyland and looking for a budget price.

Trip Advisor certainly helps and reading the reviews was valuable.  The Astoria is exactly 1.2 miles walking from the main entrance. While I am a daily walker, we used the ART anyway because we knew we would log many miles in the park and be tired at day's end. Our grandaughter and my wife used the pool and it satisfied her, and the spa pool relaxed me after a long day at the park.  The ART stops right out front and is a short ride on the ""A"" route. For $3.00 per day/per person, unlimited trips, it is worthwhile. You can purchase the advance pass at the desk (they do not sell passes on the bus, only cash $1.50 fares).

I was apprehensive to try the Astoria Inn and Suites considering it received mixed reviews, however I was pleasantly surprised when my family and I showed up at the hotel.   Even though the hotel is located on a busy street and right off of the freeway, we did not hear too much traffic (we were on the second floor and our parents were on the first). For people who have a problem sleeping, I would suggest a room towards the back of the hotel (just in case!).
