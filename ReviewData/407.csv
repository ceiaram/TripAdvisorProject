We were first put into a room just off the pool on the the first floor. The light blared into the room because we couldn’t shut the curtains. The room smelled like cat pee, the room had mold all over, the wall paper was pealing, the shower rod was half torn out of the wall so the curtain wouldn’t stay shut, the tub faucet was not sealed. AND THE BEDS ARE THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE AND SMALL BEDS EVER! It’s like lying on a board.   Our next room was upstairs which had a balcony.

It is next to a noisy freeway and  industrial area. It is defiantly not a family friendly stay or safe outside of your room at night. The hotel itself was dated. The man who greeted us that night while I juggle my tired and sleepy toddler was less than enthused about his job-which made for a great first impression. I was told my card would not be charged until I arrived at the location and checked in. My card was charged 236 initially for the stay-I did not authorize this transaction. That was not as big as a deal as I was planning on staying there that evening after an EPIC Disney trip.

We wanted to address some points to bring clarification to what may have occurred during your stay and provide some insight.  In regards to the safe missing from the sleeping room, one of our upcoming projects entails placing new safes for all rooms that are located in the main building. Our Tower building has them already. When it comes to the towels, we apologize that not having enough brought some inconvenience to your stay. We understand that we can do better and see that it brought a sense of frustration. As far as the note/tip goes, our housekeeping team did not seem to understand it or see it. The one day that your room was not serviced, it was noted on our records that a “Do Not Disturb” sign was placed on your door. It is our policy to notate this information from each room daily. Hopefully this will help explain why your room wasn’t tidied up on one of the days. However there’s no excuse for not accommodating your simple request regarding the towels and we’ll certainly address it. We noticed that the rest of the amenities and services were enjoyable. We hope that you change your mind and give us another try when you’re back in the area as we’d hate to see one issue out of the many perks we provide to make the ultimate decision.

It seems as if we’ve missed the mark on this. We will be addressing this accordingly. If you’re willing to share more details on your booking, we can pinpoint where we can focus our attention. In regards to the breakfast pricing, most of our guests have breakfast included since we are offering a promotion called the Sunny Summer Promo. This promotion also offers a discount off the room rate providing the greatest value when staying with us. When it comes down to our WiFi password, we provide a hotel information sheet upon your arrival that lists out the access code. If this wasn’t communicated to you, we will be certain to do a better job. In regards to leaving by 10:30 pm, we’re not sure what this is in regards to.

I grew up in the area and remember the hotel as pretty dumpy before it was a Crowne Plaza. I was a bit reluctant after winning the priceline bid but I was pleasantly surprised.  The hotel has been remodeled. I believe if you took the hotel and the rooms and put it on a nice beach somewhere it would be a five star. The staff was courteous and professional. The room was very nice, large, with comfortable beds. One nice touch was the little sleep packets they place on the bed. It contained an eye patch and ear plugs as well as some lavender scent. I have never seen this and I thought it was a great idea.  I didn;t have any meals there so can't comment on the food. The common areas were very clean and well maintained. Overall I was very pleased",November 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,538,407

The room we got was very nice, it was clear they had recently  remodeled and they did a good job. Our room was in the building at the back of the property so it was away from the freeway noise and the building was very quiet.  The only complaint with the room was that the bed was a little hard even though it had a mattress topper it could only do so much to disguise it.    The front desk staff was nice, maintenance staff was prompt in responding when our toilet became clogged, and room service arrived in a timely manner.  All that being said, here comes the bad part of our stay. My sister in-law used the banquet facilities there for her reception-big mistake.

I travel to the Fullerton, CA area frequently and was excited to hear about the new Crowne Plaza in town. This property is fantastic! I was truly impressed by the staff and the property itself. It was clean, quiet, and classy. The staff was friendly and inviting, and the rooms were large and impeccably decorated. This property holds true to the Crowne Plaza standards I have become accustomed to, and they definitely have a repeat guest in me!",October 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,540,407

The rooms were so clean and comfortable that at times we just wanted to stay in longer and relax and take in our suroundings of our fantastic rooms.
