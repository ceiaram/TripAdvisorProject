We didn’t want to waste alot of money on a hotel/ motel we would not be in much. For that reason it ticked the box!   Room There was a musky smell to the room which was not pleasant. Had to spray perfume to try a freshen it up, thankfully we were only in the room to sleep. The room was kept very clean.  Breakfast  Don’t worry if you miss breakfast (between 7to10) as it’s only cheap pre packaged muffins and pastries to take away, no very nice. Plus some fruit and hot drinks.   Parking was easy and included in the cost of the room.   Laundry room was very clean about $4 to wash and dry.

The room really had everything we could have wanted at about half the price of the rooms we usually stay in which are directly across from the entrance to Disneyland. This hotel is right next door to a Disney parking lot with a free shuttle to the park. What could be easier than that? The breakfast is grab and go with a few little snacks and fruit. We usually only stay at hotels that offer a full hot breakfast, but right now, no hotels in this area are doing that anyway.

Firstly it was very clean, as with most guest Disney was the  reason to stay as only 15 min walk to main Disney gate.  There is a shuttle but walking there for us was easy.    There are the plenty of things in the room towels, coffee maker, microwave, fridge, soaps a good A/C and heater, as cold only used heating.   TV and safe     Some negatives, but none would change our minds recommend staying here.    TV remote ours did not work, yes we could have mentioned it but we’re not in room that much and too tired to watch TV.     ( that’s minor isn’t ). Sheet on bed did not quite fit?

When we first walked into the room we passed another room, possibly the laundry room, and the window was open. I smelled a very strong odor similar to propane. We entered our room and our room, too, smelled of propane. Not only that, I was surprised how small the room was because the pictures online make the room look large.

To clarify your entire experience with us let me detail the incident as it appeared to us.   You had made two separate reservations for your stay. Both, for the suite with three queen beds. The first reservation was for one night. The second reservation was for three nights. When you initially checked in for your first reservation there was no mention on your part to us about your second reservation for three nights and so we were unaware of your second reservation when you initially checked in. Since you are a repeat guest we gave you a complimentary upgrade for the night as a courtesy.   On the day of checkout we were informed of your second reservation but were unable to provide you with a complimentary upgrade as the rooms were already reserved by another guest. Had we known about your second reservation in advance we would have not put you through the inconvenience of moving rooms. Sorry, our computer check-in system is not capable of notifying us of your second reservation when you checked in the first night. You also did inform us that you would be giving us a bad review when we mentioned that you had to move rooms. That was not very polite nor professional. We never want to inconvenience any of our guests as you are the most valued part in our humble business. So please do learn to extend the same courtesy to us and not post reviews based on your emotions but facts.  We did offer a small discount for your inconvenience which may not seem much to you but we believe that we were not in the wrong but out of loyalty and courtesy as your wife & rest of your family were extremely understanding and helpful in moving all belongings to the room type which was originally reserved by you.

We normally book the option with two connecting rooms.  Each room has two queen beds.  This works out great as when we have booked two rooms at most other hotels, getting adjoining rooms or rooms anywhere near each other is difficult.  This visit, we booked the option with a sofa bed and two queen beds.  The sofa bed was well maintained and east to pull out.  Our kids (7 and 9) shared it and had no complaints.

Because of timing on my part, (last minute) I wanted to stay there for 5 days and I had to stay in two different rooms, one with 2 full size beds and bunkbeds (room 218), (kids liked that idea) because each of my 3 teenage children had their own beds on those nights and this room was very roomy, we didn't feel cramped. There is another room like 121 quite a bit smaller with bunkbeds as well, (I looked in when they were cleaning this room.)  Days 3,4 and 5 were in the Queen suite (like room 226) with a locked door (mom and dad time together) and the two full size beds in the other room for the kids.

Our room was decently sized with 2 queen beds, refrigerator and a microwave.  I checked the room, I found the rug to be a bit dingy and I'm usually not one to be a clean freak, but I found walking on the rug barefooted to be a bit a disgusting.  We found tiny insects flying around the room, there was a cricket in the tub one morning and 1-2 ants could always be found somewhere in the room.

No - a larger room would cost about $35/night more - yikes! We also highly doubted that the beds were queen sized - they looked like doubles.

I freaked and killed it immediately.  It kind of looked like a mini scorpion bug, but I really didn't get a long look before I killed it.  I then looked and saw a little blood stain on the sheet where my leg had been.  Maybe it was a tick, or a bed bug, I don't know, but I was freaked after that.
