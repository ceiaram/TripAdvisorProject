They gave us a box fan, but that didn't do very much to cool the room down. We needed to switch our room after the first night to a room without the ocean view, so we could get AC.

Luckily for me my parents brought me to the Surf and Sand for the first time when I was 6 and every year after that for 1 to 2 weeks until I was 18. I fell in love with the ocean and its creatures during those visits. As a result, I have had my own non profit ocean conservation organization for nearly 25 years now so I wanted to pay homage to the place where my childhood dreams were formed and then came true. That is why I chose to celebrate my 60th birthday at the Surf and Sand with the love of my life and our friends.

It's a great beach and the resort is comfortable and generally well appointed. But it is not for everyone. The (affordable) pool-view rooms are LOUD all day with the thud of dance music coming from the pool. (I imagine you would not get this noise if you were not in the center building which overlooks the pool.) This is unfortunate because the loud music drowns out the sound of the waves from about 10:00AM -8:00PM. The pool itself is small and always crowded, 1/2 with families with kids, and 1/2 with a ""hip"" party crowd.

The bad is its an old building patch together so the insulation is terrible, you can hear people walking and dogs barking at all hours.

Overall, its a luxurious hotel but old and honestly a bit tired, they did some cheap renovations and you can tell the construction quality is not great, for example the wall in the shower actually overhung the tub by half an inch.

I have been coming to Laguna for years and have walked past on the beach and thought it looked lovely.

I guess you now realize its all about the VIEW! Waves crashing to wake you up in the morning and waves crashing to put you to sleep. I know some didn't like the sound of the waves but we loved it! This could be a 5 star resort if the only criteria was the view! BUT there are many things that don't fit with the view. The constant yelling and screaming of children was crazy. Maybe one end of the resort should be for adults only ? The slamming and banging of doors was 24 hours a day. Simply put rubber door dots in the frames could of eliminated this annoyance. The pool is way to small for the number of potential guest. Every spot was taken everyday by 8:00AM. Again maybe make it an adult,April 2015,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1744,15

If you were driving down PCH and were not specifically looking for the hotel you would never see it. The service at the SS is TOP notch. Everyone is very accommodating. My wife and I spent 3 nights there and our entire stay was hampered by the fog that literally just sat right on the coast line. We made the best of it and hung out by the heated pool and had plenty of drinks at Splashes on the glass. A great spot for couples or families in my opinion.

Having stayed at hotels throughout the world, the resort is priced about $100/night too high for their standard king room.
