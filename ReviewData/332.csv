9 helpful votes,5 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great stay but eh,"Overall great stay @ Element Irvine. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The hotel staff has been friendly and helpful.   However, someone should talk to the morning cook about providing unbiased service to all guest. Upon  arrival we asked for 3 fried eggs and he says can only make 2 and direct us to the steam eggs. We read and understand the there was a sign that says no omelette service  but no sign indicating maximum amount of eggs per order/guest. (Policy/rule) no biggie.   Secondly; I ordered another item and said thank you! Few moments later, the cook replies say please in front of the entire lobby.   I do not understand why I need to beg for eggs in the morning if I’m a guest and it is your job. There were clearly other guest who didn’t say “please” and  there was",February 2023,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,332

44 helpful votes,84 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great experience,"Have had mostly positive experiences with the Element brand and decided to try this spot. Really enjoyed our stay.   Pluses: It's a new(ish) hotel and everything was well maintained and clean. Rooms were very clean. We were only there for one night, but it has the feel of an extended stay place for business travelers, with a cooktop, fridge, plates, silverware, etc.   It is quite close distance wise from the Santa Ana airport and I didn't quite notice HOW close until after I booked the spot, but plane noise was minimal - I'm a pretty light sleeper and I couldn't hear anything disruptive.   Clean, not-spooky, well lit parking area. Friendly employees, from front desk to kitchen staff to the handsome bartender.   There really isn't a minus at all, and as casual travelers we'll",August 2022,none,none,"Hello PJCoastToCoast,   Thank you so much for staying with us at the brand-new Element Irvine!
