The room wasn't cleaned daily but you can request with reception for housekeeping to attend to your room as and when. Wi-fi is good and there is easy access to the freeway, plus a shuttle bus is on offer to get you around the area. Now the bad stuff - I had no joy getting one of those shuttles as they were always booked up, so I either had to walk everywhere or rely on friends to ferry me around! There is NOTHING around here bar a very good cafe that's only open till 3pm, so it's a bit lacking for atmosphere, though the Spectrum Centre is about 20 minutes walk away and has some good leisure facilities if you want to let your hair down.

Marriott would never do that, stay there instead.",April 2022,none,none,"Hi Perry, I wanted to respond to your recent review because the reservation you booked included lower rates which Hilton central reservations extended to you as you committed to a full 4-night reservation over specific dates which got you the lower rate. Advance purchase bookings are non-refundable, non-creditable, non-changeable, nor can they be cancelled. I believe our Front Office Manager spoke with you and attempted to explain that at the property level we cannot make any changes with these bookings. Once you booked your reservation you made the commitment for a 4-night stay at a lower average rate than had you booked a cancelable, changeable, refundable reservation. Similar to an airline booking. You can change a flight or room reservation but the seat and room costs more for that flexibility and protection. We truly hate to lose your business. I have typed the restriction notes from Hilton’s Advance Purchase web page for reference. These are the rules they established, my sincere apologies. Wishing you the best,  ""Full prepayment is required for this reservation, your credit card will be charged immediately.
