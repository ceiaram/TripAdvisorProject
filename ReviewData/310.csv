Perfect for the two of us. Bed was so comfy and we really enjoyed relaxing in the courtyard! Located right across the street from the beach, we couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful and relaxing weekend!

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Beyond Disappointed...Disheartened,"Where to begin. In December, through Hotels.com, I made a reservation for this hotel. Unfortunately, I accidentally made the reservation for 02/23 as opposed to 12/23. This would normally not be an issue, but this particular reservation was not revisable. I immediately recognized my mistake and reached out to Hotels.com, who told me that I would have to speak directly with the hotel. I called and emailed the hotel and spoke to a woman at the desk who took mercy on my plight. While there were no more available rooms for 12/23, she assured me that they would refund my money. I told her that I appreciated her understanding and her Christmas spirit. Adding that as educators, lost money was particularly impactful. A few days passed, and I noticed that the reservation had not been",February 2020,none,none,"Hi Steven,  Thank you for your time posting this review. It's been brought to my attention that we have two different posting for Tripadivors, so I'm just now seeing your comments. Our records shows that we reached out to Hotels.com/Expedia to request your cancellation and refund and was told that you needed to contact them as well to confirm the cancellation since this was a non-refundable reservation. Via email, I relayed this information to you along with the phone number to complete your request. I also followed through with Hotels.com/Expedia later that day to make sure your request was granted, and was told that they left you a message and was waiting to hear from you. At that point,  I left you a voicemail with instruction to contact Hotels.com/Expedia to get your refund. Honestly, I don't remember the outcome or if you followed through on your end. However,  I understand mistakes happens and I know that I genuinely did my best to assist with your situation. I've been working in hospitality for the past 15 years and feel very passionate about serving others with exceptional customer service, and I must say that I'm beyond disappointed and disheartened over this review. I would be happy to talk with you again should you ever be in the area or planning a trip to San Clemente. Thanks again for your time! Kind regards, Lora aka woman at the desk",none,none,none,none,none,none,2,310

We stayed in the big studio on the top floor and I must say that the attention to details makes this place really special.  The decor is really thought out -- you really feel like you're in an authentic hacienda! -- from the cozy leather couches, big wooden table, bedding, curtains, dark wood furniture... It's honestly a superb room.  Considering how much we were paying for a crappy Airbnb this place if a FIND and super affordable.   The place was quiet, safe, you'll have a gorgeous view from your balcony.

2 helpful votes,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,San Clemente Dreaming,"My family and I stayed in the back units for a few days while travelling through California on vacation.  I have to admit that I was a little nervous about staying here.  Booking a place sight unseen is always a little risky, but now that I have stayed here, I plan on coming back over and over again.  I can’t say enough about this place.  My family and I loved this place for so many reasons.  First off, the property is beautiful and well maintained.  According to the owner’s website, the buildings were built in 1928.  The timber framing, solid plaster walls, and antique fixtures make this place far more interesting and unique compared to any of the other places nearby.  I couldn’t help but feel the history as I made my way about the property.  From time to time I could hear the",July 2017,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,310
8 helpful votes,4 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wonderful,"My boyfriend, Doug, and I have stayed here several times over the last year. It has become our favorite landing place when we are in Orange County. The rooms have ocean views and are a 3-minute walk to the surf. The units are clean, comfortable and charmingly styled in a Spanish style. The outdoor areas are lovely - with fountains, plants, comfortable seats and views. The owner/managers, John and Karen, are friendly, attentive and meticulous caretakers. I can’t think of anything to gripe about. The closest I can come to a complaint is that the coffee makers provided in the rooms are modern and nice, but make weak coffee (we like it really strong). Fortunately, there is a great coffee shop a few steps from the front entrance. A superb experience all around!",May 2017,none,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,6,310

Karen and John live in front and thankfully choose to open three smaller casita type accommodations. Each has its own ocean views  patios and special touches while remaining private. While the hacienda looks inviting from the street - it just gets better as you enter the inner courtyard.....lots of specialness. Waves can be heard from everywhere - relax anywhere inside the compound or walk across the street to six miles of beach, the San Clemente beach walk, the magnificent pier, two perfect places to eat or drink at La Gallete or Pierside, or stroll uptown for even more great cafes.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Fun and Romantic,"Just had to mention this beautiful, unique property in South Orange County. It's really two different venues--by day it's the epicenter of the local surf and beach crowd, while after sunset everyone moves elsewhere and the entire area is quiet save the whooshing of the ocean or the train rumbling by. Literally steps from the Pacific and every view is stunning. Each room in this 1928 Spanish-style complex has its own look and feel, heavy wood tones and white stucco. The renovation was complete a couple weeks ago and every room has modern bathrooms, kitchens, and full cable TV. Two or three breakfast places next door and a decent restaurant out on the pier, which it also overlooks. The place is owned and managed by the couple who runs it, and, yes, they live there too.

Full kitchen to prepare your own meals, or walk to the many restaurant options. Beds were extremely comfortable, with lovely linens. A beautiful fireplace with wood provided! And the views! Dining, living, kitchen, and bedroom have incredible ocean and palm tree views. We stayed in the back apartment and had plenty of room (one adult and two children). You could easily sleep 4 or 5. Karen and John were amazing hosts! The privacy and overall vibe left us feeling this was our ""home"" during our stay. We will be back year after year! Also, we didn't even need to rent a car.

Especially trying to charge 200.00 a night for room! Got our money back and went to hotel down the street!",March 2014,none,none,"Sorry about your first impression of the Hacienda.  I think you should return at a later date and I’ll tell you why.  We are in the middle of a 2 year restoration right now.  We contemplated renting our rooms during the restoration.  As we got started about a year ago, the people who stayed with us showed us their appreciation for restoring this very special historical building back to its original state.  Also, we have noticed that most everybody so far has been very patient and some have returned during the work being done here.  With that said, let me get to the actual complaint now.  Because of repiping and installation of heat ducts, we were forced to open up the walls in some areas.  Well for the most part we have been keeping up with the wall patches.  We couldn’t get those ones done in time before you got there.  I should have covered those up with paper or something before you got there.  Sorry, my fault.  Yes, you are right the closet for that room is at the bottom of a stairwell that doesn’t get used now.  We will make an adjustment for this soon.  As for the scaffolding, yes, it is all around the building right now because we are resurfacing the exterior of the building completely.  The scaffolding will be down soon.  All of these things are part of our restoration and we are very excited about it.  I don’t know what you are talking about in regards to the room rate.  We charge $125/night plus tax for this time of year during the week (Sunday-Thursday).  Karen did refund your money as she said she would.    We always tell everybody when they make their reservations that the restoration is going on and where we are with it in and around the room that the person will be staying in, but when you made the reservation we hadn’t started the work on that room yet, and when we found out that the work in that room wouldn’t be finished, we called you in advance to let you know, in order to give you the option of cancelling the reservation if you wanted to.  Your daughter said to keep the reservation.  John R Gabay III",none,none,none,none,none,none,15,310
