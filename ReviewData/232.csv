Let me tell you it was nice getting a hot breakfast in the morning.  The room was very comfortable and clean. I slept really well. I have had some hotels where the beds where miserable to sleep on but not here. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean.

There's a small pool, but I didn't swim in it. The water looked kind of cloudy. But I wasn't there to swim anyway. The hotel has a weird setup in that some of the hallways are open-air, so you're outside in some of the hallways to your room. That can make it kind of loud at times in your room (if it's near the hall, which mine was) because you can hear people talking and rolling their suitcases down the hall.

To be fair, the property looked nice, and it was clean. The water pressure was good, and the iron and fridge were in working order. The bagels were fresh.  And I paid only $109 for a room with 2 queen beds.  But...  First of all, it was very humid inside. The weather outside was not, so it was clearly an issue at the motel. The room was strangely shaped, so the air conditioner was actually pointed at an angle towards a wall, rather than into the room, so it didn't help much. In addition, the exhaust fan in the bathroom was not very effective, and it just made the humidity worse.  The bed was uncomfortable, and the pillows were lumpy and flat.  The towels were thin.
