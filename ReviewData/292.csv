I was a tight squeeze, but we managed. Booking this very expensive suite gets you a few perks. Free valet parking, welcome bag off all sorts of sweets, club lounge access and nightly shortbread lolly pops. By far the best perk is the private seating for shows/events at the theme parks.

My mother has a scooter and we were on the 4th floor.  Every single day of our stay, it took almost 20 minutes to get to the lobby.  Every elevator that came, was completely full so she couldn't fit, and the elevator only came 4 or 5 times in 20 minutes.   Even if we wanted to take the stairs, its not an option.

On this trip, I choose the Paradise Pier and was not disappointed.  Paradise Pier is the least expensive and smallest of the three Disney hotels, but still offers the benefits.

After the remodel of the Disneyland Hotel we wanted to try it. So after staying now at the Grand and Disneyland I wanted to try the Paradise Pier so I could say I stayed at all 3 hotels. This review is from a back to back trip. 3 night stay,  and 7 days at home,  and returned for 3 more nights.  From my arrival on the first trip I was met by Robert who helped with my car and luggage.  And I thought if the rest of the staff was half as nice and helpful it would be great. I was wrong, I can't think of any of the hotel staff that wasn't great. I even needed  the assists of hotel maintenance and they were there within 30 minutes to restore the power to the bathroom.

We could have stayed at the best Western Stovall for $113 a night but decided to pay the $400 a night instead. NOT worth it. What Disney doesn't put on it's web site, nor does the Paradise Pier, is that the extra magic hour is for one section of the park only. Fantasy Land. Sometimes Tomorrow land will be open too. However all other sections are still closed. So you are still stuck waiting inline for the favorite rides, especially if you are visiting during the busy months.

About a 10 minute walk to the park. However in the room it did smell a bit musty and one night after unlocking our safe a cockroach ran out from under it.   Freaked me out so much I called the front desk and they moved us to a Premier Suite on the 10th floor.  They didn't ask where I saw it or apologize for it. They just moved us.  Im sorry but there is never just 1 cockroach anywhere. Just kinda grossed me out.  Also the elevators took forever. There are 15 floors and only 3 elevators. And tons of Little kids.
