The rooms were very clean, roomy, and all around very nice. Price was incredibly affordable. Had some minor issue with some channels on the tv but that was hardly a big deal seeing how we spent 98 percent of our time out of the room anyway. I needed to print some tickets out from my email and the incredible lady in the office was very quick to help me do that at no charge. Our room keys stopped working for one of our rooms and it was fixed within minutes. We talked to the lady in the office and she explained that they just bought this property and have been working",March 2014,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,47,58

Rooms were clean and was quite. Motel was really clean from the outside. Wifi was excellent. Also the continental breakfast was good. Don't know what they made the coffee with but i loved it! Most importantly the staff was very nice and welcoming. When we arrived we were greeted very nicely!!! Didn't want to leave the place but unfortunately had to get back to work... I WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS MOTEL AND GO BACK AGAIN VERY SOON!!!!!!!,February 2014,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,48,58
