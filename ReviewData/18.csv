To begin, the room was *clean*, no mildew or mold in the bathrooms, no dust in the corners of the room, I was super comfortable letting my toddler roam and roll. We had a park view suite - 2 bathrooms (one In bedroom, one in living area) and requested a crib. The crib comfortably. King bed in the bedroom and a sofa sleeper in the living area. Got a family of 4 adults, one toddler. The king bed was comfortable and clean. My parents slept on the sleeper sofa.

24 helpful votes,34 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Simple and clean hotel which is very close to Disneyland,"We stayed at Tropicana Inn and Suites for our visit to Disneyland!   Check in was a very fast process. The lift lobby is not directly at the front desk area and we actually have to cross the road entrance of the hotel to get the lift.   The room is very clean. It has a mini fridge and microwave which were useful. The sink area is not inside the toilet which is great as anyone can use the sink anytime even if someone was using the toilet.   One thing in the shower is that the shower head is attached directly to the wall. Hence, this makes bathing a little challenging.

It is literally across the street from the main entrance (Best Western was the closest). We stayed at Howard Johnson earlier in the year which is just a few streets down but this makes a world of difference when walking all day with kids. It was an easy walk and totally worth it! Parking is $15 a day not including tax. We luckily got a room on the main floor near the reception and close to the Main Street so I would recommend requesting that. We stayed in room 150 with 2 queens and a sleeper. Room is small but had all the amenities. It gets stuffy so you must turn on the AC when you are in the room. Staff is very friendly.

You pay an extra $12 + tax per night but could not get a space because they reserve most of them for their valet service. There's no fee but you have to tip the guy which is an added cost.

It's so inconvenient for guests. Sometimes if you're lucky enough and find a spot, it will be blocked by cars that the valet crew temporarily park until they find a spot for them.

After walking and standing in lines all day, it is SO nice to be able to cross the street and be at your room. I've stayed at hotels where you need to take a shuttle back, and at the end of a long day it is the worst to wait for a shuttle. The rooms are clean, beds are comfy, and there is a continental breakfast, just a snack to get you going for the day.   This is a great hotel at a great price. We were rarely even in the hotel, just to sleep! It is nice to be so close that you can run back to the hotel midday (to drop off purchases, grab a sweater etc) and be back in the park in no time!

As I reply to all emails personally, sometimes I may not have an opportunity to respond as quickly as I would like to, so please accept my apology for the delay until now.   As the parking has become more of a challenge to manage  over the past few years, most of our Hotel Neighbors began charging for parking over two (2) years ago, however, the Tropicana Inn &  Suites delayed implementing a parking fee until May 1st , 2011.   Because of our close proximity to the  Pedestrian Entrance into the Disney Resort, our property is a popular destination spot for families wishing to walk to both Theme Parks; so guests arrive early before the Parks open in order to get a “head start” before the long lines.  When guests arrive early before check in, there is not enough parking spaces available early in the day, therefore, the Hotel had to began charging a pre-registration parking fee for this reason. The Daily Parking fee structure is:  Pre-Registration Parking Fee - $9.00 + tax up until 4:00 pm  Daily Parking Fee - $9.00 + tax per day  Post-Registration Parking Fee - $9.00 + tax until Park closes (after check out)  Your family pre-registered your vehicle at 7:46 am which is the reason that you were charged the additional pre and post parking fees.
