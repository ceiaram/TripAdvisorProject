none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"For what it is, surprisingly good","I booked a room here in case I needed to be able to stop and reset on a Sunday and turn back around to San Diego on Monday... I picked this hotel because literally every single errand I would need to do Sunday afternoon could be accomplished on the same block across the street after check-in and there were some photos on Google that didn't look like a crime scene. I didn't have to stay over but wanted to check out the motel anyway for future trips back and forth as I was headed past... I was pleasantly surprised... The rooms are recently refurbished, clean, and well-maintained. The outside is clean and freshly painted. The desk clerk was polite, friendly, and offered great customer service.  I would have been comfortable staying overnight.

138 helpful votes,231 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good value,"A first stay at this conveniently located hotel. The room was clean, there was minimal amenities, an outside ice dispenser which was free and a beverage vending machine. The lighting in the room was more than adequate. Most importantly it was quiet in spite of the closeness to a freeway entrance and car wash. The staff was efficient and professional. The only negative was that the internet was slow. Also, there was a free microwave in the office as the room did not have a microwave or refrigerator.",March 2020,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,299
4 helpful votes,2 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,good: very hot water and full flush toilet,"The area around the hotel is very loud and the windows are old letting in much of that outside noise (sirens, yelling) so I did not get much sleep. The parking lot is heavily lit (presumably to keep sketchy folks away from your car) but it also lets a ton of light into the rooms. The linens were sparse. It is across the street from neighborhood walmart if you need anything. It is very loud and the walls are thin. They did have free WiFi, which made me give them a 2/5, instead of 1/5. The hotel looks like it rents by the hour.  Also the hot water was very hot and they have a full flush toilet. I didn't see any bed bugs or roaches (previous review).",December 2019,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,299
