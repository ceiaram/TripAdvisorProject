But we did get spells of rainlessness, and man, did we love this place. It must be something even more special in good weather! I can't comment on the air conditioning (it was around 40degrees F already) but am very happy to report the heating worked very well.  The bathroom was updated and modern, with a slow start to the hot water (possibly due to weather) but once it got hot, it stayed that way for a very long time. My only criticism is that it's an older built hotel, so accessibility might be an issue if you don't have a ground level room.

The purpose for my stay was business with a little pleasure but I knew I would not be n the room much.  The Capri Laguna On The Beach was the perfect spot.  A good and fair price for what I wanted.  The staff (everyone from the front desk to the cleaning staff) was so awesome and pleasant.  The room was clean and the bathroom was not fancy but clean and comfortable.  The room air conditioner was as quiet as it could be though not the same as a central air. The bed was comfortable.  It was a little difficult to get wifi but that's not what I was there for.

My Fiance and I absolutely love the room we stay in for the view and ocean sound. The only downfall with this place is its in serious need of renovation and updating. This place has so much potential. For what the rooms cost, this place should be visually appealing too in my opinion.   The bed is uncomfortable and comforter had 2 holes in it so the down feathers were coming out. The shower does not get hot enough and the sliding door and screen door were extremely hard to open and close. Most likely due to sea salt.   If this place was renovated, I'm sure the ratings would drastically come up. The office Staff is beyond friendly and courteous and another part of why we come back.

4 helpful votes,7 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Capri Laguna Beach - Overpriced,"We had an oceanfront room with a balcony overlooking the ocean which was a lovely view. But the room was very basic, like a standard motel room. The price was $350/ night which when you add on all the taxes and resort fees, it came to $450/ night, so I thought it would be luxurious. It was not. The breakfast was the usual stale pastry offerings that you get at all motels. They do have a pancake machine that plopped out two tough pancakes. The Starbucks machine produced very good coffee. The hotel is on a steep cliff, so if you have a room on the 100 level, you have to walk down several flights of stone steps. They have staff to help you with the luggage . The beach that’s shown on their website has washed away, and at high tide the water is all the way up to the wall.

I found a room at this hotel on TripAdvisor for a relatively cheaper price (still above $400) but still a lot of money for my budget.  What the heck, it was my indulgent splurge and was a full ocean view.  The hotel is old but I think has been refurbished with some amenities.  The room was quite small and somewhat quirky and the ocean view was partially blocked by a protruding roof line.

2 helpful votes,6 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Quick Getaway,"Made last minute reservations and the staff was very helpful. They recommended Beachfront, which was great advice. This hotel is older and modest. The rooms are clean and the location can't be beat. I gave it a 4 only because it lacks a couple of conveniences and amenities we would use, like a restaurant onsite and a spa by the pool area. However for the location it's well worth it. The bathroom is bigger and more up to date than the neighboring Surf and Sand Resort (at 100's less in price of stay) I also like that they have A/C, although it's portable it works well and allows you to close the slider if the ocean is too loud when sleeping.

We had the privilege of staying at Capri Laguna, located South of downtown Laguna Beach.  Taking a break from our business trip in LGB.  Check in was smooth and fast.  This is an older property like the majority of properties in Laguna.  But they keep everything up to order and well maintained.  The main reason for staying at this property is the location and view.  Since it is a bit South of downtown it is also quieter.  One of the guests at this property told me her husband was attending a conference at the Ritz Carlton further down the coast in Dana Points.  She told me her kids preferred to stay with her at this property than at the Ritz.

It is right on the ocean, with staircases right to the sand. Parking is easy, and you are walking distance to everything Laguna you could want.  I booked an ""oceanfront"" room. The room we were given (room 723, in case you stay here) had a slight ocean view, but was not oceanfront. The sliding glass door faced the staircase to the go to the beach, which was pretty well-traveled (meaning you didn't want to leave it open for noise and privacy issues), and across the narrow staircase was a wall.

I have not been to Laguna in 25 years. I’m retired now. I was in the Hotel/Casino business for many, many years. I was at the famous Sands during the Rat Pack years with Sinatra, Sammy, Dean and all the guys. This Capri Laguna is so well run. Nick and his staff are very good at what they do. They all do what is needed and do it well.  I had a room looking out over the ocean and it was great. Beautiful sight and at night I opened the windows and could hear the sounds of the ocean. What a wonderful way to go to sleep. Capri is on PCH, in the 1400 block. So it’s 14 blocks to downtown. Out the door and to the left. A very nice walk.

I asked my husband to call a day before to confirm reservation and he is told that in fact there is a weight restriction of no more than 25lbs. My dog is 80lbs of love. I am upset to say the least.

From the beach front balconies to its walking distance to all things Laguna Beach, Capri Laguna Inn has it all. Clearly not to be confused with a modern achatectual wonder Capri Laguna Inn should never be confused with the latest W or Manderin Oriental, HOWEVER, neither of those has the location in Laguna Beach the Capri Laguna has.

When there are fewer bad reviews than good, I usually take them with a grain of salt.  Thank goodness we DID!  This is a charming little place, right on the beach.  It is older, but that only adds to it's charm in this case.  All of the common areas are kept up beautifully.  I love the fact that it has narrow little walkways, up down and all around, to access the entrances to the various rooms. It is multi-leveled, with little entances to the rooms, tucked everywhere. It has steps down to the sand also nice adirondack chairs and an umbrella available at your request.

But, still, it is pleasant and some of the rooms are comfortable.   The primary attribute is its location -- on the beach with splendid view of the Pacific. Our arrival was marred by inept staff that kept us waiting for hours rather than assigning us to another room -- some sore of repair was necessary.  Then, the room was not comfortable - deficient air conditioning (that should not even be necessary in October). We were able to move to a much nicer room with plenty of room, overlooking the ocean.

But they converted this placed without an architect or designer.  Everything is half broken. Even the toilet paper holder. They couldn't even fix that?! The bathroom door is not aligned so it's so hard to open and close. Our front door has a huge gap at the bottom so you can hear everything that's going on outside.  Walls are paper thin. I can hear my neighbors make their coffee. That's just half the stuff that is wrong with this place. What else? The parking.  It's so tight and small I dented my new car.

That's way it's less expensive.  Yes, there are a lot of stairs-it's built on a hill.
