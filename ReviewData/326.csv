This place bore little resemblance to the photos or description. Our first impression was the stale, musty smell of old upholstery. Floors were dirty with pet hair, which is odd for a place that supposedly doesn’t allow pets. The furniture was old, smelly and stained, making you want to get a tetanus shot from just sitting on it. I filled a trash bag with old food left in the refrigerator and there was mold growing in the shower and shower curtain. The description stated there was a sofa bed and futon, but there was no futon. We were instead given an air mattress that looked as if it were Korean war surplus, and of course the air leaked out in the middle of the",July 2015,none,none,"Thank you for your feed back.

First of all, the manager seemed nice and liked to joke.  However he kept referring my my girlfriend as my secretary, kept talking to his dog like it was a business partner, and charged my card twice. Thank god my bank blocked it. He also photo copied our driver's licenses and my atm card multiple times, looking around as if he was being watched by something. His office was what appeared to be his living quarters, it was dirty and messy and smelled of dog feces.   Once getting into the room we immediately noticed dirt on the floor, screws hanging out of the ceiling, and a bed that felt like a plastic box with pillows.

Allow me to explain.... My girlfriend booked us a room here online. We wanted a cheaper place to stay for a night and figured it would suffice. Plus, she had visited some site which had decent to nice reviews about people's previous stays, so all seemed ok.  Prior to arriving she realized her card had been double-billed. So she called to get one charge reversed, and spoke with 'Savannah' who assured her she would have a confirmation email showing proof of refund. By the end of next day  This email never showed up. Savannah never followed up. Refund was never issued. Room was pre-paid. Twice.  Upon arriving, we were greeted by a guy named 'Lucky' who was the hotel manager.

I got double charged a whole week before I checked in and the billing person, Savannah, was negligent about providing proof that the refund had been processed. I had to email and/or call each day and did not get a response until after checkout. The refund was supposed to be processed a week prior. It was a a complete waste of my time to have to be getting her to do her job.  The room was dirty (hair and other debris on the floor, especially the bathroom) and there was a dirty, smelly sock in the bedsheets that pretty much proved that they do not change the sheets.

Even though it was terribly early in the morning, and we didn't call ahead... the Manager had no problem finding us a room available at the exact same price that we were quoted online.

THIS PLACE HAS NO AC!  Yes you heard me right. I was NOT warned about this. No AC in the summer time in California. How is this even possible?  If I knew about this,  I would have NEVER book a night at this place. And for the price of $150 a night, no AC? ! Really?!   We were in the town for a friend's wedding.

Stayed Sunday and Monday night, kind of a run down old motel that would be fine if it were better run. The main gripe was cleanliness - for example the bathroom had not been cleaned and neither had the fridge, which was unplugged and smelled nasty. When we asked the owner to fix these things he did right away, but only exactly what we asked for and nothing more.
