Secondly he’s trained through a program and you have no right to say that my dog isn’t a service dog.

We were lucky to get last room here. The hotel may be small and older but it's very clean. The staff is amazing. Maria and Marriana took great pride in keeping the breakfast room stocked and clean. They also helped guests if needed. Alice at Front Desk came to our rescue on second night when we walked in to damp smell and wet carpet by sink. She had maintenance come right away. They were going to clean carpet and put in dehumidifier since there were no more rooms.

Great service, very clean, very accommodating. This trip was quite different. Our room wasn't clean when we arrived. There was sand on the floor and in the bed sheets. After the first night I requested that our sheets be changed and floors cleaned while we were out for the day. That didn't happen. We got into the room around midnight, exhausted from our day, and nothing had been touched. I called the desk and they sent over a gentleman with a couple bed sheets, not nearly enough to change all four of the beds.

The breakfast was very basic and doled out sparingly. The toiletries were in a metered shower mounted device (pump) and we had to buy toiletries. This left the impression that your stay was being monitored by the staff so you would not have more than what they felt was the minimum which was a BARE MINIMUM. For those used to hotel standards, this was a very basic room and not at all what was promoted.  It was equal to Motel 6 standard.  I would not stay there again.

We’ve made dozens of trips to DLR over the years, and have come to prefer parking at the park as opposed to staying within walking distance. We’ve found security at the resort to be shorter (and cooler) when parking at the Mickey & Friends structure, rather than going through the long, hot lines on the Harbor side.

I was told the manager was on vacation and would see it the next week.  I didn't even sign the checkout form.  I didn't expect much, but I did at least expect an acknowledgement (phone call, email) that the manager saw the feedback form.  Here it is July 27th and still nothing.

Give them a call for those suite rates and availability before booking your room online. I believe you can upgrade for a minimal fee.   Staff was nice and the 24-hr front desk personnel were helpful.

The hot tub steps are small yet quite deep.  2 of us tripped getting into the hot tub and ended up with scrapes.  So just use caution.

1 helpful vote,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Stanford Inn stay during RE Congress,This hotel was not our first choice but ok considering I booked very close to the start of the event. We had to take a suite with a cute room for children that had a set of bunk beds and a little table with two chairs. Would have been lovely for a family but there were just us two adults. The amenities were skimpy especially after visiting our church's hospitality room at the Hilton and seeing what they got.

Staff were exceptionally helpful and made good recommendations about the local area. We weren't convinced that the ART bus, Disney transfers (via their own car park) were the best options for getting to the parks... I would suggest that if you're a fit/healthy family then book this hotel and walk it. Taxis are also available. The art bus goes in the wrong direction initially and (albeit only $5 per person) is unnecessary since the park is only a mile away. They also come only every twenty minutes.

I was very pleased with the hotel overall.   BREAKFAST: The breakfast is great (waffles, toast, sausage, eggs, cereal, oatmeal, etc.) and it certainly saves a lot of money to eat at the hotel before going to Disneyland. There are 3 waffle machines which were very popular, though there was often still a line to use them. There was no variety from day to day in the food options, which was disappointing. The other gripe I had regarding breakfast is that breakfast starts at 7:00 on weekdays. Disneyland opens at 8:00 (or 7:00 if you have a Magic Morning pass). If you have kids, it is very difficult to eat breakfast and catch the ART shuttle in time to make it to Disneyland by 8:00.

We had a room that faced the street behind the hotel which is a quiet, residential street with emphasis on quiet; we didn't hear a thing all night from outside.  You really want this because Harbor Blvd is very busy with buses, cars, etc.  In the morning, there is a free breakfast in the pantry close to where you check in with waffles, fruit, cereal, hot eggs and sausage, juice, milk, & coffee.

The amount was not listed on the website and I have heard of $50, and even $100 deposits, but never $300. I thought it was extremely excessive, especially for someone who is unaware and traveling on a tight budget. Otherwise, I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The ART stop was only two doors down for Disney, and the housekeeping was really exceptional.

Due to our hotel is an exterior corridor property. All guests walk from the parking lot directly into the room. Sometimes, the guests walk back and forth from their room to swimming pool with their bare foots. It always carried dirt form outside into the rooms no matter how they do it. That’s why even we clean our carpet much more often than normally required, we still not able to maintain our carpet as clean as we intend to. The second floor’s conditions are better than the first floor.  In addition to clean carpet more often and re-surfaced our parking lot to decrease the dirt, we installed some rubber area mats in last year at all entrance locations to try to catch the dirt when the guests walk across those mats.  However, the results were not good as we expected and those rubber area mats were totally worn out already. So, we removed all those rubber area mats.  Now, we are on the process to consult with some carpet manufacture to come out some exterior carpet option to be installed at our hallway or entrances. Once we selected the carpet, we will submit it to obtain our franchiser’s approval prior to our installation. It may take us several months to complete it. Hope this exterior carpet can help to improve this situation.   We are also on the process to enlarge our breakfast room. It will also take several months to design a plan, obtain the permit from the Building Department, and construct it.   Again, thanks for your business and your comments.

First off, using the word ""Maingate"" in the name of the hotel is misleading. One would assume that it would be right by the park entrance but it is over a mile away from it. There were stains of who knows what on the little sofa in our room & the tile in the shower seemed to have been a little moldy at one time because the grout was stained too. Our daughter's family stayed in one of their ""kid suites"" & it had a bad musty smell in it. The ""full"" breakfast was a let down. They had a variety of foods to eat, buffet style scrambled eggs, sausage, make you own waffles, etc., but the eating area is small & therefore the whole area was crowded all the time.",April 2012,none,none,"I am regretting to learn that my property does not meet your expectations. However, I sincerely appreciate your businesses and valuable comments.  Regarding the “Maingate” issue, this property has re-branded his flag to be Comfort Inn for more than 10 years. Within these years, it has been owned by three different ownerships. There are total nine (9) hotels named themselves as “Maingate” around Disneyland Resort. Each one is flagged as different brand and all are the closest property away from the Disneyland Resort for their brand. I only consider one of these nine hotels is located right across the Disneyland, even it is on the end of the whole block with around 8 minutes walk. Among these nine (9) “Maingate” hotels, we are the fifth closest hotel and we are exactly one mile from Disneyland.  I did have one time considered to remove the “Maingate” from our name. However, it has taken so much efforts and money to build our reputations for the past 10 years. I am afraid our repeated customers may not find us and reserve to other Comfort Inn. Please be aware that there are totally 3 Comfort Inns in Anaheim and 2 of 3 are located on Harbor Blvd, we are on the South Harbor Blvd and the other one is on the North Harbor Blvd. Even right now we have “Maingate” shown on our name to try to separate from them, we still see lots of our guests came in and want to check in and then realized that they booked to the wrong one. Since there is a one-day penalty charged for the same day cancellation, the guests have no other choice and have to stay to other place which they don’t intend to do in the first place. I can see there will be a lot more confusion happened if we really remove “Maingate” away. That’s why I decided to keep our name as is. Besides, if I really want to change the name, not only I need to spend lots money to do advertisement, change all my printed material or amenities, but I also need to change all my contracts and/or agreements with my lenders, franchisor, and all my vendors since the guarantor has been changed.  That is too much works involved and I don’t see the benefits from this action.  Regarding the moldy smell, would you please contact me directly or call to our place and leave a message for me to indicate which room you were staying. I will definitely looking into this issue.  I realize that our breakfast room is not big enough, even our franchisor requests us to have 27 seats for breakfast and we already offer 64 seats. Since we are located within Disneyland Resort zone and our guests are much more families with kids than all other Comfort Inns not in the resort area, our seat requirements should be higher. Please understand that it is a hug e task to change an existing building layout to accommodate with a large breakfast room. I am consulting with an Architect to see any way we can accomplish this task within the budget I can afford.  Again, your business and comments are greatly appreciated. Please do contact us for the room you stayed. If we have any progressive for the breakfast room, I will post it on our facebook or twitter.

Regarding your experience with the hot tub, I have to apologize that the temperature and the cleanness are far below the expectations. Matter of fact, this exactly same issue already happened several times after we installed the emergency shut-off switch in our pool circulation pump system. By the Federal Law, all public pools and spas need to install an emergency shut-off switch in the circulation pump system to prevent people’s clothes and/or hair being sucked into the pump and causing people drown. If people try to enjoy the sucking pressure from the spa’s pumping system, they always cover the sucking drain hole as tight as they can. However, this will cause the circulation pump shut off and cause the water dirty and not hot enough. Since this circulation pump is different and separated from the injecting pump, people can still use those injecting pump and does not aware the circulation pump is off.  My maintenance crews always checks our pool/spa and pumping system every morning when they start working and every night when they close the pool. Since this circulation pump shut off is happened during the operation hour, now I have them to do additional checking around 6:00PM.

Our guest service agents always explained to the guests about the hotel industry’s standard “No-Show” charge policy and cancellation policy.

I was also impressed to see someone from the hotel actually reads these reviews.  Check in was smooth & the front desk was very friendly. A much welcomed change from the hotel we had just come from in Irvine. We had just come from the beach, so we checked into our room & headed to the pool. The pool & hot tub are very nice, but they're in the parking lot & this causes a HUGE downfall. Right behind the hot tub area is the garbage dumpster. Maybe it would be ok in the cooler months, but in August, the",August 2011,none,none,"I am regret that you did not have an enjoyable experience to stay with us.  Regarding the garbage dumpster locates right behind the pool and hot tub – until you mentioned on this review, there is nobody even bring up my attentions that the smell does ruin their enjoyment. Since we always schedule our garbage pick up four times per week to make sure our trashes can be cleaned up no more than two days, I never know we have such smell problem. To solve this problem, first all, I will have my crew to wash out the trash bins once a week. If it does not solve the problem, we may need to consider making that space enclosed.  Regarding the water temperature issue - I discussed with some plumbers and everyone gave me some different solutions and/or suggestions. However, they all believe that there are too many people use showers in the same time, especially there is a team staying in due to they all being waken up on the same time. I am evaluating their suggestions and seeking the right solutions now.  Regarding the room cleaning services were too late - I have to admire our housekeepers’ training can be improved to be better. During the busy seasons, I usually have them to clean the checked-out rooms to make ready for the new guests check-in. However, there are guests like you did come back during the mid-day to try to take a rest and our housekeeper did not make the room yet. From this past summer, I already revise our work strategy to start to clean the stay-over after their lunches. I think they are not completely following this new strategy yet. It is our bad.  Regarding the parking issue - we really have more parking spaces available than most of hotels/motels around the Disneyland Resort. A lot of places charge the parking fees to lower their parking demand or allow the guests to double park their cars, which always cause problem on the next morning when the other guests found their cars being blocked. We do not have such problem. We do have two parking areas available in our property. One is located within the courtyard place and the other parking area is on the other side of building. Since our guestrooms are back to back, and those parking spaces are also in front of our other side’s guestrooms. There is no different safe issue for these two parking lots. Be honestly, Anaheim is a good area to visit. We did not have any problems happen, at least up to date, in our guests’ vehicles. There is nothing you need to worry about.  Regarding the scrambled eggs - we cook our scrambled eggs every morning. We bought those liquid eggs, not powdered ones, from our breakfast vendors. This type of liquid egg has been widely used in almost every restaurant which serves the breakfast. I do not know our scrambled eggs are different from others. I also don’t even know there are powdered eggs sold in the market. Since you come to Disneyland quite often, I am sincerely inviting you to check the liquid eggs we purchased. If you want, I can even arrange our vendor to meet you to discuss this issue.  Regarding the plastic container to heat up the sausage with microwave – if you noticed, those plastic containers are brown color, not regular clear container. These brown-color plastic containers are made by the high-heat resistant material which is designed for this heating purpose. This container can resist from -40⁰F to 375⁰F. Please be noted that Orange County Health Department comes to inspect our breakfast facilities twice per year. If those containers are not safe to heat up the food, they will not allow us to use also.  To conclude my reply, I do still sincerely appreciate that you spent your valuable time to write this review and share your feelings, both good and bad, with us and everybody. I wish you can stop by next time when you visit Disneyland again. You don’t have to stay with us, but do come back to check out whether we do any improvement and verify the statement I replied above is true or not.   Thanks for your business and comments.

We set up the temperature to 78 F in pool and 103 F in spa. We may need to re-evaluate the temperature setting. 4.)	Our maintenance crews are always planning to clean all A/C units during April and/or May on every year to prepare to be ready for the summer seasons.

After I reviewed your comments, I responded your review and posted it on 8/18/10. After reviewed my response by the Trip Advisor’s staffs, they decided to remove your review from their review board. They did not notify either you or myself since this is their sole decision. I did not know this fact until I saw your re-posted review again. Please understand that we are unable to remove your review away from our Trip Advisor review board.  Since your original review has been removed, I herein generally describe your comments (since I don’t have a copy for your review) and also provide my reply as following:  1.	YOUR COMMENT: When you checked-in, we gave you a room flooded with water, then re-assign you to a different room. However, our housekeeping carts were always blocking the walking path you need to walk out. –-- The first room we assigned to you is clean and vacant the night before you checked in. That’s why our system showed that room is vacant and ready for rent. However, there is a plumbing issue happened on the guestroom next to yours on the same morning you checked-in, that’s why we are fixing the problems when you checked-in and have to re-assign a new room (Room #137) to your family. I appreciate your understanding and cooperation. I understand that the route passing our laundry room is the shortest route from Room #137 to our front lobby. However, there are two more different routes you can take to come out from Room #137 to the parking lot. Our housekeeping carts do occupy partial hallway to do their job and clean the rooms. But their working hours are between 9:00AM to 6:00PM. There should be no hassle at all to go to your room.  2.	YOUR COMMENT: Your family went back to your room on the second day 2:30PM and 4:15PM on the third day to try to take a nap and your room was not cleaned yet. --- Your family checked-in on 8/7/10 and checked-out on 8/10/10. We had (52) rooms checked-out and (49) rooms needed to check-in on 8/8/10; and we have (48) rooms checked-out and (48) rooms needed to check-in on 8/9/10. Our policy is during the busy season, unless guests placed a request to clean their room at or before the certain time, I always want our housekeepers to clean those rooms checked-out already first to make those rooms ready to check-in the arrival guests before 3:00PM. Then, they can start to clean up those rooms stay-over. During the slow season, we will clean up the rooms stayed-over first since we have lots rooms still available thru the last night, which are available to check-in the arrival guests. My housekeepers’ working hour is 9:00AM to 6:00PM. Usually, we don’t have too many issues to do this way since most of guests once went to Disneyland are not coming back until late evening. Our housekeepers did not intend to clean your room late due to any other particular reason.  3.	YOUR COMMENT: Your wife came to front desk on the third day afternoon 4:15PM to complain your room has not been cleaned yet. And the staff showed a shocking face and said there is no special request has been made. You believe this should be a standard requirement and don’t know why you need to make request. –-- Actually, I am the person at the front desk having a “shocked” face to answer your wife. Since she told me that there is no housekeeping service in your room on the day before and you did not put the “Do Not Disturb” sign in front of your door, that’s why I got shock because my housekeeping team shouldn’t miss a room not being cleaned. I called my housekeeper supervisor to the front desk immediately to try to find out why your room was not clean the day before. In the meantime, your wife said that your kids need to take a nap before you all head back to Disneyland again, I offered her two options to either having my housekeeper go to clean the room right away which will take about 40 minutes, or your family go ahead to take a nap and I will ensure my housekeeper stay overtime to clean your room after your family head back to Disneyland. After she called you and discussed over the phone, you decide to stay over the pool area and want us to clean the room immediately, which we did. After my housekeeper supervisor checked her book, she confirmed with me that your room had been cleaned the day before. I thought your wife might be too angry, and then she tried to state more serious to catch our attention. Since your wife already left our front desk, I did not go after this issue any further. Your original review title states that “Incompetent staff who make excuses instead of solutions”. Those two options I offered are pretty much the only choices I can come out. I wonder whether you have a better suggestion for this situation. If you do have one, please provide to me to help me to improve ourselves.   4.	YOUR COMMENT: You believe clean it should be a standard requirement and don’t know why you need to make request. --- Clean your room is one our regular services. But have to finish to cleaning your room before 4:15PM is not. I tried to explain to your wife is our housekeepers are working from 9:00 AM to 6:00PM. Their jobs are to finish cleaning all the rooms before they go home.  If we know in advance that your family will come back on the certain period of time, our housekeeper can schedule amount their own works to make it ready for your family. Without know that, they just randomly schedule their own works which may not fit in your demand.  5.	YOUR COMMENT: After housekeeping finished cleaning your room on the third day, you start to afraid that housekeeper were too upset and suspect that they may drunk your toothbrush in the toilet or do something to your towel. --- Be honestly, your family came back and found the room is not ready at the middle of the day is not the first time happened to us. My housekeepers were used to deal with this situation already. This request will not upset them. In every morning, every housekeeper was assigned a list of rooms to clean during that day. For this case, all we did was calling them to clean your room first. We will not blame them since they basically did not do anything wrong. I don’t understand why you and your wife have that kind of ideas that the housekeeper will do something terrible to you.  6.	YOUR COMMENT: Your family got the bed bug bites. ---- Regarding the bug bites, once I read your comments, I immediately called our pest control company, Isotech Pest Management, Inc. to send a technician to check your room (Room #137) on 08/16/10. Isotech is one of the leading company in the pest control industry. I have a written report from Isotech, after they finished the inspection, states that “Inspect Room #137. Customer complain (Bitten). No bed bugs or infestation of any pests were physically found at this room”. I will mail you a copy of this inspection report. In according to that specialist’s comments, there are so many different pests existed in the outdoor areas will cause you been bitted, such as walk to Disneyland, take a ride, sit close to a landscape area, …. and etc. If he can not find anything inside my room, it most likely your family was not bitted in my room.  7.	YOUR COMMENT: You don’t believe that our mattress is recently replaced and found deep peaks and valleys. --- In our website, we clearly state that we replaced all mattresses on the end of 2007. We are no intention to try to fool anybody. I personally went to check the mattress in Room #137 and won’t able to find the “deep peaks and valleys”.  Again, your business and comments are sincerely appreciated. I hope the above reply can earn your understanding and forgiveness. We are looking forward to receiving your suggestions to help us become better and hope we have another opportunity to serve you and your family again.",none,none,none,none,none,none,3019,240

I personally came out and explained to you that either I can have two housekeepers start to clean those two rooms immediately which can be ready within 30 minutes, or we can arrange two rooms side-by-side but not connecting rooms. You finally decided not to wait and take two side-by-side rooms.   Then you also complained that you being told we have FREE shuttle to Disneyland Resorts and you ends up need to purchase Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle passes from us. You called it was a hidden cost for us. I explained you immediately that since you booked your room thru your own preferred travel agent, they should always sell you the deal based on our website information. There is no statement such as ”Free Shuttle” or ”Complimentary Shuttle” in our website. I don’t know how they refer you that incorrect information, so I can not speak for them and I am not able to compensate those ART passes to you.  I even told you that there is a Disneyland remote visitor parking lot located within 8 minutes walking distance from our hotel. You can walk to there and there is Disneyland’s FREE shuttle can take you to their entry main gate. However, you refuse it anyway. Matter of fact, since City of Anaheim established ART shuttle service to take all visitors from all hotels to Disneyland, City of Anaheim does not allow any more private shuttle to drive into Disneyland, unless those hotels already have their own shuttle services running or the hotels located in City of Garden Grove, not Anaheim.   Regarding your room are not ready at 5:00PM, it is an un-intentionally error caused by us. Unless the guests particularly request us to clean their rooms at a certain period of time, once our housekeepers get the room cleaning lists, each of them just randomly schedule their own order to clean the rooms. In our peak season, our housekeepers will first clean the rooms been checked-out, so we can have rooms ready for the guests check-in on 3:00PM. Then they will start to clean the rooms which guests stay over. Usually, our guests go to Disneyland will not come back until the late evening. Unfortunely we did not know you will come back. Our housekeepers usually finish their works around 6:00PM. Your room must be the last few rooms need to be cleaned on that particular date. All the inconvenience we caused to you and your family are un-intentionally. I herein sincerely apologize to you.  We are regret that you are so upset.

I personally am an experienced traveler while my family are very inexperienced, yet all of us agreed that this hotel needs considerable improvement.  Firstly, noise. The walls between rooms are painfully thin and there appears to be little if any sound deadening between the upper and lower floors. The net result is that any noise from above sounds like a heard of elephants while you can quite literally hear every sound from the neighboring room (in our case it was so loud as to waken both children during the night). Add to this the perpetual noise from the car park (have the heard of double glazing?) and this is far from the most restful of motels in which to spend the",July 2010,none,none,"First all, I have to thanks you spent your valuable time to write this comments to express your concerns. I sincerely appreciate your efforts.  This is not the first time I learn that the guests were awaken the entire night due to the other guests stayed in the upper stair and/or their next room made too much noise. We have lots of families with kids or school groups to stay with us and visit Disneyland. Most of time, everybody spent a whole day in Disneyland can exhaust themselves out pretty much, and then everybody will take a deep sleep. However, we are not lucky all the time. Sometimes, they came back to their rooms after midnight and kids/students were still hyper and continuously playing or running around. They can waken the guests stayed next to them. If this case happens, our front desk staff needs to call to their parents or teachers, sometimes up to 5~6 times, to seek their help to calm down their students or kids. Dual glazing windows may be one of the best options to resolve the noise from parking lot, but I need to consult with some experts to find out the best way to decrease the noise from the neighbor and/or upstairs.  Our maintenance department does have a Prevention Maintenance Program. I wonder why our maintenance staffs did not pick up those problems in your room. I also check our records that you did not place any complain regarding your room conditions. I regret that we missed the opportunity to fix the room for you. However, that is still no reason for us not able to find those problems prior to your arriving. I will get together with my chief engineer to inspect the room you stayed. I want to make it right.  Our breakfast outside seating areas is all covered, not a totally outdoor environmental area. For the weather we have in the Southern California, it usually works pretty well for our guests. Unfortunely, you experienced an unseasonably cold and drizzly morning. For our property’s size, our franchise requires we have total (27) seats to serve the breakfast. Even we already have 24 indoor seats plus 40 outside seats in our breakfast area, we still have not enough rooms quite often. Sometimes, I wonder myself that I should be happy or should be worry.

I am planning to take two actions to try preventing this condition happens: 1.	I am currently looking for an asphalt subcontractor to re-surface and re-stripe the entire parking lot. Hope the sealed topping can help to reduce the loose dirt and grease caught by the guests’ shoes. Due to this work need to close out our parking lot in sections for a week. We plan to have this work done in our slow season, such as September. 2.	  Add some carpets at the hallway entrances. These carpets should be able to catch some loose dirt and grease from the guests’ shoes. We will see the results after these two actions done.

We usually will clean all the A/C units every year after spring break over to the early June to prepare for the summer. However, no matter how our schedule is, it is not acceptable to have the smell of mold. I already address this issue with my maintenance crew and housekeepers. The housekeepers should immediately report these problems, such as mold, broken toilet seat, etc. It Is no reason for us not taking care those before the customers arrive. It is our bad. There is no record for any complain that the refrigerator froze everything before you checked out. After you complained during your checked-out, we went to check it and found no problem with that refrigerator. Unfortunately, we are not able to prove to you since you already left.

There was an area main sewer line clogged on the New Year day. We have no other choice and have to relocate your family from a kid suite room to two connecting rooms. Thanks for your understandings and cooperation to agree to relocate your room. These connecting rooms are standard two queen size beds room. They all have refrigerators but no microwave ovens and big screen flat TV. Under our records, we did move the microwave oven from your existing room to Room #203, which is one of the rooms you move in. However, I did not see the record that we move the 32” flat TV to replace the 27” standard TV for you. This is our fault. Even you may not place any complain during that time, we should automatically change it for you, since the TV sit over the room you moved out is no use anyway. I will make this rule as our future standard practice. Again, thanks for your comments.  Regarding your room have not been cleaned, I have to do the following explanation. Under our housekeeping daily records, there are total 9 rooms posted “Do Not Disturb” sign outside their doors and requested no services on 01/02/2010. Your Room #203 & #204 are two of these nine rooms. No matter under any circumstance, our housekeepers all being trained not to go into the rooms with “Do Not Disturb” signs on. Your rooms not being cleaned is resulted from the “DND” sign on the outside doors.  Regarding the reason you supported to check out on 01/02/2010, the original reservation for all your group thru another travel agent website is for three (3) rooms total from 01/02/2010 to 01/05/2010. However, your family decided to come earlier, so you booked one room thru our franchise central reservation system from 12/30/2009 to 01/02/2010. Since these two reservations are thru two different channels and the ways we bill are different, one we need to bill you directly, and we need to bill the travel agent for the other reservation. So, in our computer system, we have to check you out and re-check you in immediately to the same room. That’s why we need to reactive your room key. However, this is not the reason we did not clean your rooms. My front desk staffs replied you the wrong information. If the guest supported to check out but forget the date or they decide to extend their stay but fail to notify our front desk, our housekeepers will still clean the room and leave all guests’ stuffs in the room and wait for them come back. Since they supported should check out, their room key will be expired and they have to come to front desk to seek assistant for either reactive their key for a late check out or complete their paperwork to extend their stay.

Besides this ART shuttle service, drive and park in Disneyland is also a good option, especially with a big family. The parking fee is $12.00 per day which you can in and out as well.

If we can't take care of it to your satisfaction, I usually try and offer some kind of discount to accommodate for the inconvenience.

The 1 Bathroom Kid's Suites and regular deluxe rooms have no problems with this.  We have floor fans readily available to help alleviate this problem for no charge.

This hotel is not really walking distance to Disneyland in our opinion but it is on the ART  Red Trolley line which picks up next door.  I believe we paid 2.00 or 3.00 per person for a days use.  Otherwise I would suggest driving yourself because after walking all day at Disneyland, it's a long long walk back to the room.    The hotel was easy to find with easy in and out of the parking lot.

Boy, was I surprised as I had read so many good reviews on the motel. As we entered the room, the room had a old, musty odor and the place did not ""look"" or ""feel"" clean.  The rooms are terribly outdated and in need of major renovations.  We had booked the kids suite with bunkbeds.  This was the only positive I saw- room for all of us-2 adults and 3 kids.   The bathroom had a shower/tub and a toilet.  You could barely use the toilet and have room to shut the bathroom door.  The bathroom was that tiny.
