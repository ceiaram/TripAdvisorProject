That definitely saved when we didn’t have to pay the $60 parking rate. A few suggestions would be to bring various adaptors for electrical. Everything comes from the lamps which didn’t keep any plug in very securely or weren’t hot so when we found one that would, we needed to have a multi charger that could accommodate many plugs which I forgot to bring.

The day of my arrival I couldn’t wait to hit the Jacuzzi to ease my sore muscles. I went to see where it was before going up to my room. The Jacuzzi was filthy, with some unidentified objects swirling in it. I didn’t even want to know what it was! The pool was also dirty. I told the front desk clerk and they said they would do something about it but acted though it was my problem, and sure enough, when I checked back later, the pool and Jacuzzi were still gross. In my three days there I never swam because of this.  The staff (I dealt with four different people) were all somewhat rude.
