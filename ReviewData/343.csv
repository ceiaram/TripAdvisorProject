2 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Awful experience,I called this motel to get directions and was told I didn't need a reservation because they had plenty of rooms.  I tried to give them a credit card over the phone and they said it wasn't necessary to reserve a room and refused to take my credit card number.  When I got to San Clemente I called them to let them know I had arrived and was told I had 15 minutes to get there. Since I was using public transportation I said that wouldn't be possible but that I would get there as soon as possible.  The person hung up on me.  I called back and the next clerk also hung up on me. I then had to find another motel on short notice. I reported this incident to the Better Business Bureau who said the motel never responded.,August 2005,none,none,"Motel,does not accept reservations for same day arrivals.Same day arrivals are on a walk in first come basis.Sorry for the problems.",none,none,none,none,none,none,46,343
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Not Bad for a Budget Motel,"We stayed at the Best Value Budget Lodge the weekend of August 19,2006. One of the busiest summer weekends of the year.  We paid $198.00 plus tax, it seemed high at first but we later realized that it was the going rate for that weekend.  We got a nice clean room with the standard motel amenities, it was nothing fancy, but not the bare bones either.  We met several regular guests at the check out who informed us that this motel was the best kept secret of San Clemente.  If you are looking for  a full service  motel this is not a place, altough there are many great places to eat and drink within walking distance.  We will definately be staying here again during the Thanksgiving Holiday....",August 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,47,343
2 helpful votes,2 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Way overpriced for the budget joint that it is!,"This hotel was $198 per night with tax. It should have been $125. The owners who checked us in were very unfriendly. When we got to our room, we noticed there was no shower but a big jacuzzi with a water wand.  To get ice you needed two quarters which I have never seen this degree of cheapness before. The towels were rough, small and minimal. No extra ammenities like shampoo, conditioner or lotion. The Hampton down the street is much much better for a comparable price. I will never stay here again.",July 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,48,343
