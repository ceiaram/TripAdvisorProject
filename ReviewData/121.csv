Arrived at 1pm only to find out room will not be ready until 3 (front desk was very firm on not alllowing guests to check in before 3) which I guess is fine but I don’t understand why they can’t release rooms as they become ready by housekeeping.

While we waited a janitor spilled bleach all over and they were cleaning up the mess and spraying Lysol to cover up the smell.

The location is surrounded by business centers, so the outside is pretty clean & safe. The inside tells a different story. Hilton should invest some money into updating this hotel, including the rusted tub, squeaky elevators & the pool— oh let’s talk about the pool. It’s a 4 ft deep square with no appeal whatsoever. The concrete is peeling, the seats are outdated, the spa has a weird smell when the bubbles are on. Very underwhelming. The room was pretty clean, but don’t even bother using the mini fridge.

There's a free airport shuttle, an omelet bar at breakfast plus they very kindly allowed me to check in a little early, so overall a great stay.

The traffic noise wasn't too bad, but the TV / next door noise was disruptive for sleeping and working.

Parking for check-in was a little tricky but once we got that figured out check-in was a breeze. Our room was very nice and updated. We were able to control the temperature so it was the right temperature. Actually the only complaint about the room was that for the first 30-45 minutes after check-in it sounded like they were doing drag racing on the street outside. The parking garage is tight and they stack cars up in there to the point that it is almost impossible to get out. One night we received a knock on our door. It was the security guard.  He stated that they had found our car with the doors open in the parking garage. He wanted me to go down and check it,November 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,518,121

It is very easy to find and close to the John Wayne airport. We chose the self parking option which is $21 but at least there is a parking garage to keep your car cool.   The room was huge and well appointed. Large windows gave a good view of the surrounding area. The fitness center was very nice.  There isn’t much in the immediate area but there is a marketplace type area across the street that has a Starbucks and a few other restaurants. The hotel also has a restaurant inside.

Helpful staff at checkin provide a warm cookie and a list of restaurants with the distance from the hotel. Had a room facing the front - better off facing the back if street noice or lights from the street bother you. The hotel has a decent restaurant for breakfast and had a business dinner here as well. Small outdoor pool on the second floor is a pleasant retreat with lounge chairs. My room was spotless and the bed was comfortable with higher end linens.

There was no sense of urgency or apologies from the front desk for the inconvenience.  The free breakfast was enjoyable, although nearly identical each morning.  Housekeeping was good, but it was odd when on the first day, our toiletries (i.e., dental floss, comb, brush, etc.) had been laid out on washcloths on the bathroom counter.  I assume it was a thoughtful gesture, but a bit unnerving that a stranger handled our personal items before/after cleaning the room.

First, it is at one of the noisiest street intersections in Orange County.  Second, the business estate where the hotel is located has much construction going forth.  Third, it is near the point where the 5, the 55, and the 405 freeways intersect.    If you stand in the parking lot and listen, you can hear a low-frequency roar from all the traffic.   The hotel itself is hemmed in on all sides with no room to expand.  That does make parking difficult .  If you come in late at night, finding parking might put you through some changes.     A very diverse clientele here.

I've been HiltonHhonors Diamond VIP for years, and all I got was a coupon for a beer or a glass of wine and a coupon for the buffet breakfast.  Hampton Inn's have it all over this hotel; they get it...this Doubletree doesn't.",April 2007,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel and sharing your feedback.,none,none,none,none,none,none,1754,121

50 helpful votes,50 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Stay at the Doubletree,"We got the Doubletree through Hotwire for one night for a quick trip to Disneyland. In our group were my wife, our one-year-old son, and myself.  Location: The Doubletree is super easy to find, a block away from the 55 freeway in Santa Ana. It took about 15 minutes to get to Disneyland from the hotel. We also drove to Newport Beach, which was about 10-15 minutes from the hotel as well. The area surrounding the hotel has a little downtown feel, as there are mostly tall business buildings. Most of the cafes and such were closed at night however.  Outside Appearance/Lobby: The hotel was spotless inside and out.  The lobby is very nice and elegant. We got our Doubletree cookies as usual and they were very good. There is a parking charge ($14 per night of your stay) the parking is",March 2007,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel and sharing your feedback.,none,none,none,none,none,none,1756,121
35 helpful votes,12 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Liked the Doubletree,"I booked this hotel through Priceline- $60+ $14 or so for taxes and whatnot. We got there late, and yes, were suprised by the $12 parking, but pleasantly surprised by the room. The king bed was nice and firm, there were numerous pillows, and the towels were pretty nice. Check-in and check-out was fast and courteous. Another nice perk was that since we got there so late (around midnight) they let us have a late check-out: 2 PM. Considering we booked the room 1 day before, I have to say this was quite a nice place to stay for the deal we got through priceline.",August 2006,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel and sharing your feedback.,none,none,none,none,none,none,1757,121

We got a good rate from Hotwire for $59/nt, $72 with tax and fees so it was definitely worth the value.  It was very clean and the bed was oh so comfortable.  There were 5 down pillows and a down comforter.  Right off the 55, so it was very convenient.  It says Santa Ana but it's more less Costa Mesa.

106 helpful votes,71 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very good hotel and a great location!,"I stayed one night on business last week and got a $68 rate from Hotwire.  Considering the Expedia rate was $190, I thought this was awesome.  Good location near John Wayne Airport and local business and easy to get in and out.  The parking was free on my trip, whereas other people have said it was $12.  An upscale apartment complex and small retail center (coffee, wines, nails, etc.) shares the property.  As for the rooms, I found a good-sized bathroom with great towels, nice toiletries, a great shower head and a granite lavatory, though the bed area itself was faily small.  The king-sized bed was soft (maybe an older mattress), but the linens were very new and I must have had 5-6 down pillows on the bed.  Check-in was quick and my wake-up call came right on time.

89 helpful votes,60 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,very nice place,"Very nice place, was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the earlier negative reviews... nice bathrooms, comfortable beds, good size rooms. Pool a little on the small side but we only used it once so it was no big deal. Not far from the 5 highway and only about a 20 minute drive into Newport Beach. Would definitely stay here again in the future IF I could get the same rate off of Hotwire as I did this go around. Parking was easy and convenient and 12 bucks isn't really all that bad considering I paid 26 a night earlier this summer at the Omni in LA...
