Before we got into the room, there was a loud noise coming from a boiler or some type of ac unit, loud and very high pitched sound ALL NIGHT LONG! The hardwood floors not only where they filthy with old ""food"" stains, creeked so bad. I felt the need to clean the floor myself as I did not want to walk around on possible human body fluids or animal/insect/rodent fluids.

We arrived to a receptionist who understood very little english, and spent the whole time I was talking to her burping and carrying two young children , it was almost impossible to book with her . after finally getting through to her, and paying $10 more than what we were quoted , we were provided with a room which reeked of smoke. Let me know I was not provided with a receipt . After sharing the smoke smell  apologised and gave us another room- not fancy or clean  by any   means , by we had already paid for one night so decided to",December 2015,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,415
none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Awesome Inn,My family and I stayed at the Legacy Inn for two nights in July.2014. I enjoyed my stay at the Legacy inn. I would stay there again. We were the only ones staying at the Inn for the two nights. I looked for rooms at other hotels and the ones I check out did not look as; good as the Legacy Inn. The Legancy Inn was very convience for my family. The price was just right for us. I will keep them in mind for my next vacation stay.,July 2014,Legacy is close to the strip and other hotels.

3 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Never..again..,"So we ""booked"" this two weeks before our trip to Disneyland. It seemed fair price and not far and the pictures looked alright so we arrive and instantly it looks sketchy. We check in and they tell us we werent billed yet so we had to set all that up when we got there. They then handed us a dirty old key..that's when we got really worried. Upon entering the room the smell and stale air caused us to cringe and we noticed the floors were wood and not carpet.  The couch had stains the fridge was half solid dirty ice and there was a few spiders who had taken residency on the microwave. The bathrooms were caked in mold and the ""complimentary"" soaps were dispensers on the wall with liquid hand soap. The shower head was encrusted with soap scum and there was no toilet paper.

17 helpful votes,16 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Never again.,"We stayed in a non-smoking room, and the floors were hardwood or some approximation thereof, but the musty odor in the room was so dense that it got onto my tongue and into the back of my throat. We cleaned off months (years?) of black dust and grit from the grill of the air-conditioner/heater.  The windows didn't open, so the only way to get fresh air into the room was to leave the door open.  The bed was so hard, someone could have been doing jumping jacks on one side and the other side wouldn't have moved.  Good location and honest cleaning staff (left my iPhone in the room and it was still there when we returned).",March 2013,none,Traveled as a couple,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,7,415
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Experience!,"Our room was clean, comfortable, and very acceptable!  I was a little concerned because one review said the bed was very hard, but fortunately this was not the case at all, it was great!  I slept very well.  The staff here is very friendly and responsive.  For a fraction of the cost of all of the surrounding hotels, we had a very enjoyable stay just a few blocks from the Anaheim Convention Center, and Disneyland!  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",January 2013,none,Traveled on business,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,8,415
38 helpful votes,14 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Just So So,"We stayed here New Year's Eve because it was cheap and near Disneyland.  My partner works for an upscale hotel chain so we are used to staying at nice hotels for little or no money.  This hotel is no luxury hotel by any standards, but it served it's purpose as we just needed a safe place to stay for one night.  The hotel is conveniently located very close to the park.  It's a little too far to walk, but the drive is only about five minutes.  There is a wide selection of stores and restaurants within walking distance from the hotel.  Anything you might need is nearby.  Also, unlike the previous review, we found the neighborhood to be safe.  The room was spacious and clean for the most part.  There aren't really any views as the building is only two stories.   The hotel was busy,",December 2007,none,Traveled as a couple,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,9,415
24 helpful votes,66 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,A very bad experience,"We arrived at this place (after midnight) that was booked by our travel agent to be told that our room had not been paid for (we had pre-paid the travel agent). The dates had been mucked up, and emails we and the travel agent had sent had not been received. Manager agreed to allow us a room and said would sort it all out in the morning.  When we arrived in the room it was disgusting! It smelt bad, had damaged and broken equipment. The light shade was broken, the microwave had a huge crack in the door, the fridge was filthy. The bathroom was covered in mould and the shower did not work. The rubbish bin had filth in it.   There was no telephone book in the room which made it very difficult to find other accomodation. We did manage to get hold of America's Best and secure a booking",July 2006,none,Traveled with family,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,10,415
