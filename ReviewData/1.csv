Rooms were great, on site restaurants we went to were really good. It’s a decently long walk to Disney parks but the walk is nicer than on the other side of the park on Katella in our opinion (more green and way fewer people, shorter security line). You can also take the monorail in and out of Disneyland which gets you pretty close. The pool is small but when we went it wasn’t too crowded and was really nice and the poolside food options were actually really good. The turkey wrap was loaded with turkey and really good bacon. Service all around was fantastic. Housekeeping, valet, everyone. Especially at the lounge, William was above and beyond.

But, I relied on other reviews before choosing to stay here at The Westin. So thank you to others who have given their honest opinions.   I am currently staying here, for 10 nights total. Part of my trip is for a conference and the rest is for Disneyland. The hotel is beautiful. Lobby is large, clean and smells amazing. Room is very nice, the only thing I would say is the walking space is a little cramped in front of the beds with the small table in the way.   I booked a two Queen room with balcony and park view, I requested a higher floor room for an unobstructed view of the park, I am on the 7th floor and it’s perfect!!
