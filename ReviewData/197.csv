We had a lovely time at this hotel! The parking lot I have to say is VERY SMALL (like 10 spaces?) but I don't think that's a problem because they don't have a lot of rooms. But the spaces are squeezed too. So don't expect to get anything larger than a small sized SUV in there. (We were driving a prius so we were fine). This isn't a detractor to the hotel though, it's just a fact. And big SUVs are probably used to these problems anyways. The staff was very friendly and attentive.

I am so pleased that you enjoyed the location of the hotel, the comfort  of our brand new Sailor Suite and the service you received from the staff. I sincerely apologize, however, that you were disappointed with the views from your guestroom. Although not the ocean front guestroom, that has views over the boardwalk and parking, that you were envisioning, we feel the full view of the beach and ocean from the living room, surely deserves the description “ocean view”.   May I take this opportunity to apologize for not clearly labeling the dispenser in the bathroom. In our continuous efforts to be a green establishment, we limit our use of the disposable plastic bottles, as much as we can, to just lotion and conditioner, as they can cause issues with the dispenser. We feel using shampoo only in the dispenser is one small way to reduce our waste. Again, I am so sorry this was not more clearly marked and I will certainly be addressing the issue.    Please know that we try our utmost to exceed our guests expectations in every way so I am so sorry that you were also disappointed with our continental style breakfast, the television remote control and the on-site parking.

The nautical theme comes in handy within the room as at least for the standard version because it's about the same size as a cruise ship cabin. It's a tight fit and a bit problematic but overall the beach vibe thing works. We had some issues on cold water only from the sink, TINY bathroom and very very thin walls ...
