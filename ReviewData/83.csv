This time I was specifically looking for something with two rooms since I have two kids who are no longer babies and I'd prefer they had their own space (and have MY own space - haha!).   The ONLY con to this place, for me anyway, was the walk. The kids were 7 and 5 at the time.

Providing for your total satisfaction, from the moment you arrive to the moment you depart, is my staff's primary duty.  Hearing that we failed in your case is truly disheartening, and for that, I offer you my sincerest apology. It is my pleasure to provide you with an explanation regarding your concern about our amenities. Our hotel is known for providing great rooms at great rates, without some of the fluff that you find at other hotels. Items like toilet paper  shampoos and conditioners are not complimentary; you do wind up paying for it in the nightly rate. Although we don't place extra amenities into a guest room prior to check-in, we do have a limited supply of sundries available upon request at the front desk. We operate this way because it lets us continue to provide our guests with quality accommodations at an exceptional price. I do regret that we were not able to communicate to you exactly what you could expect before you arrived.  As for you’re the cost of stay at your hotel, the reservation made on Expedia was a third party reservation; meaning it was pre-paid before your arrival.  Unfortunately, we feel deeply sorry on our behalf as we provide all types of discounts from Government rates, to AAA rates, and more exclusively Military discounts.  We will look deep into this situation to make sure this never happens again with Expedia.  Our wifi has and will always be free, miscommunication on our behalf for not letting you know may have been a key factor in this misfortune.  We will assess this situation to the fullest extent and will work on bettering our communication with future guests.  Let me assure you that your experience is certainly not typical, and that we have put in place measures to ensure that the type of stay you had won't be repeated.

The staff was very nice and helpful.  The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable, and the comforter seemed dingy.  The carpet was very clean, but overall the room had an old, musty feel to it.  By far the worst this was the ""spa"".  It was covered with rust spots and had mold around the edges.  It was certainly big enough for two-but we didn't use it, even after we cleaned it ourselves.  The parking lit is on the small side, and the walls are pretty thin.  The room above ours kept us up almost all night one of our nights.  The continental b-fast was fine, and the coffee was great.

All the big hotel chains seemed to be full and the few rooms left were very expensive. ( A dentist convention was in town)  So ended up at the Fantasy Inn for 4 nights.   This is not a fancy hotel so don't expect too much for $65 a night!  I found our room to be clean, fairly large and the bed was comfortable. There is a pool and we could walk to Disneyland in about 15 to 20 minutes.  That's all we needed. On the negative side:  we found noise from other rooms was noticeable.  The shower was fine except for 1 night when there seemed to be no hot water.  The pool was not heated so too cold to swim and the hot tub was only luke warm.

5 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Never again,"My husband and I stayed in the Fantasy Suites in April of 2004.  Now, we have been to Disneyland since and have chosen not to stay at this hotel again.  My husband and I had a terrible stay.  First and foremost, we thought the mattress was made of concrete.  Now, I'm not used to a soft mattress, so I normally do not have any problems with hotel mattresses.   However, our first night was so uncomfortable, the next night we asked for extra pillows so we could lay on those.  It helped, but it was hard to stay on top of the pillows.  My second problem was the shower.  While I was showering it went from hot to cold, hot to cold, hot to cold.  And I'm talking scalding hot to ice cold.  Every time it changed, I had to jump out of the way.  I don't know if it had to do with others",April 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,487,83

This Hotel is family owned, and I found the staff, including the maids, to be very friendly. The room was very well cleaned and very spacious, larger than most rooms. The Hotel was also nice and quiet, with a very lovely pool. I enjoyed the microwave and refrigerator, which often came in handy. The Continental Breakfast was average, but I never ate it in the mornings, we walked to Denny's instead. There are other restaurants and convenience stores within walking distance, as well as Disneyland. This Hotel is exactly what me and my boyfriend needed to relax.

We picked it due to it's cheap price, but soon learned that you actually do get what you pay for! This hotel is sooo old and ghetto that it makes the haunted mansion look inviting. The bathrooms look like they've been around forever and the shower would not drain. It reminded me of my grandpa's 50 year old apartment. The so called ""continental breakfast"" LITERALLY consisted of orange juice, cinnimon rolls, toast and apples. And we were unpleasently suprised that it took 30 minutes to walk to Disneyland (with no shuttle).

This decision was based on the rate package, hotel amenities, the proximity to Disneyland and the favourable reviews by previous guests.  On the plus side, the rooms are of generous size, and the warm pool was a hit with the kids.  It was great having a fridge and microwave.  On the downside, the bathroom was quite dirty, the tub was chipped and the maid service was lacking as I had to request bath towels on our 2nd day. The danishes that come with breakfast were tasty as long as they were fresh, which wasn't the case on a daily basis. A choice of muffins would be a bonus.

8 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Exactly what we were looking for!,"The Anaheim Fantasy Inn and Suites was exactly what we were hoping for.  It was within 2 blocks of Disneyland - definitely a little exercise, but not too far.  It was clean and very spacious.  We got a family suite (4 double beds) for $89 a night within walking distance of the Disneyland.  We couldn't ask for better than that and it seemed well run.  Never did we have to ask twice for anything, the management was very accomodating.  We could see the fireworks from our hotel window which was great because we wanted to avoid the crowds.  If you're looking for a nice, clean, roomy, place to stay that is close to Disneyland, this was the place.  No big bells and whistles, but what do you expect for $89/night?

I was a little leary of staying there because the price was so low, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a motel-type property that reminded me of vacations with my parents years ago, but was very clean and had lots of hot water in the shower!  We had a king bed in our room w/a double bed in an adjoining room---the connecting room had the same set-up so it was great, since we were four adults and two children.  Each child had their own bed and room off the main room.

Next door there is a full breakfast restaurant which begins serving at 7 am, but the hotel does provide coffee, juice and a danish.

The new park was great but the Fantasy was average at best. Because it was rainy and cold most of our stay, we never had a chance to try the pool which did look quite inviting and lushly landscaped around it. Rooms were large and came with both a fridge and microwave. Two queen beds and a spacious closet and the largest bathroom I've ever seen in a budget motel. As there were few people staying at the motel we had plenty of space to park.
