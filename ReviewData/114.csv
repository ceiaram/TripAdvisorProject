It’s an excellent location close to a fantastic beach and an easy walk to the heart of Laguna Beach. The front desk staff couldn’t have been kinder or friendlier. Amenities were decent— coffee pods in the lobby as well as a fridge of soda and water. Other fridge offered hard boiled eggs and yogurt for a quick protein packed breakfast. Towels and umbrellas to use.   My beef is with the housekeeping. One day we didn’t receive cleaning. The front desk people were extremely helpful and accommodating (towels and coffee provided to me with apologies). The room was “cleaned” the next day but there was still a significant amount to sand on the bathroom floor and obvious marks (coffee rings) on the counter and by the coffee.

First of all the location is amazing blocks from downtown and two blocks from one of the nicest beaches in the City of Laguna Beach.  In Laguna Beach  where there are many choices for top-notch Resorts there are few choices for affordable nice hotels.  This one nails that.  Newly updated rooms, comfortable beds, nice ocean views, and great service.

Also, no shower rain - there was a tube by the way dirty around it.... - the frigobar was on another small room (empty this didn’t make any sense), and off.  - the entrance for the beach was closed..  - no elevator so you may have to carry your luggage by tour own.

But forget that, the rooms were totally renovated as of September 2014, and have lovely finishes, microwave, refrigerator, flat screens, and great showers, all very clean, and your car gets covered parking.  The owner can't be more helpful and open to suggestions.

So is a 5 minute walk to a secluded part of the beach, and covered parking right beneath the guest rooms. This little gem is out of the center of town and therefore a bit more relaxed and it is decidedly a work in progress as the new owners finish the execution of their master plan. The rooms, however are brand spanking new with nice beds, smart t.v.s and fabulous showers but the real star was the exquisite attention to my every need. From knowledgeable suggestions and information about Laguna to great late night conversation and help with my every circumstance they earn top marks from me on the hospitality end.",October 2014,none,none,On behalf of Crescent Bay Inn we'd like to thank you for staying with us!

The owners (a family) were extremely helpful and sincerely cared about our comfort and the quality of our stay. We had a recently-renovated, ocean-view room with a king-size bed. We partially enjoyed the rain shower - which was high enough for my 6'5"" husband to stand under comfortably! We also loved the 3 minute walk to beautiful Crescent Bay Beach! We would definitely recommend the Crescent Bay Inn.",September 2014,none,none,On behalf of Crescent Bay Inn we'd like to thank you for staying with us.

none,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice stay,"This hotel has been renovated. The room was very clean and the bed was  comfortable. Slept great. The staff were kind and very helpful. We have a big truck and wasn't sure it would fit in the parking spaces. The staff member, wish I could remember his name, came out and measured our truck and the parking spot. Wouldn't fit, so he let us park in a different location and called as soon as a better spot was open. The ocean can be seen from the back rooms balcony. Little bit of a walk to restaurants but there are lots of shops around if your into art and such. The beach is about a 5 min walk from the hotel.

Hershel, the manager/amazing host was the reason we decided to stay (initially). It's great to meet a fellow small business person who has such passion and eagerness to please his guests! We bought a bottle of wine, he supplied the wine glasses and ice. He even fixed a little problem we had with our rental car. This little gem of a hotel is nestled in a cool, eclectic Laguna coast neighborhood. It  was only a 10 minute walk to all of the activity & restaurants (Starbucks :) There is an gorgeous cliff walk path a few blocks down that we also took advantage of on our walks & runs in the area.

We arrived late to a smiling young man that got us cold water with a smile. He was pleasant and the inside of the inn was new fresh and really nice.

The bed's are very very comfortable, state of the art TV, and in a GREAT location! The walk to the beach is less than 5 minutes, with a path that is easy to navigate. I know in the past I have stayed at other Laguna Hotels, that shall remain nameless, I paid a lot more for and the rooms were very unkept and old. Crescent Bay Inn is on point!
