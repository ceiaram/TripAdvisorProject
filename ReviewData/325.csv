It was not too hard for us to find this motel as I used GPS to find it. As far as location concerns, I believe this motel is better located than the one in Newport Beach but that's about all. When we both arrived in late evening, we immediately got our room within five (5) minutes. Our room was in the street level (which was nice) as we had quite a number of luggage with us.
