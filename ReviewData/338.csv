Check in took forever, the only person working did not speak English and had to keep calling someone on his cell phone to communicate. They only take cash deposits for rooms and cannot provide receipts, extremely shady. I was with someone disabled and given a 2nd story room. The room was not updated and the toilet was running. I went back to the office right away and was told I had to stay in that room and they didnâ€™t give refunds, even if I was unhappy with the accommodations. It was a very run down property in a not so great part of town and the pictures posted are not what the room I was in looked like.

Called the owner the next day and he denied there were any problems, and was rude and insulting to me.

This was such a terribly bad experience that I thought it was important to comment. I am not being vindictive. The management is trying to take advantage of travelers. The management demands an unauthorized $50 ""as a deposit"" that they knowingly do not tell guest about at any time before or after the booking process, online or over the phone. They will not provide the key unless they extract this from unsuspecting guests. They often send people to an ATM machine on property that they admitted charges an outrageous fee to get get cash from and then they collect some of those fees.

During check in I was asked by the woman (I believe is the owner) for my husbands ID. I asked why they needed it since he had only booked it but wasn't present. It appeared that the Already payed for room would not be provided to us otherwise. Call it luck, but I happened to have an old ID of his in my wallet. She was just all around rude.

We mostly just used it for sleeping purposes, but the room exceeded our expectations. The size of the room was great, and the beds were probably the most comfortable I've ever slept in, in a hotel/motel. This isn't a 5 Star Resort by any means, but it was clean and the local family owners were friendly.  My only 'complaint' would be that the pool hours were kind of poor, because it was exactly when guests would be at the parks. So, I never tried it out.

Expecting the worst, I was pleasantly surprised by a clean room that had recently been updated.  Yes, the furniture is worn and I immediately removed the questionable bed spread, but the bathroom had been refurbished and was extremely well done.
