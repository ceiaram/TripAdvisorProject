A huge, clean, well appointed suite with a very comfortable bed with privacy doors. The grounds are very well kept in a quiet part of town about a mile off the 57.

I didn't use the kitchen, but it is well equipped.  Television is hard to figure out.  Bed and pillows were good; plenty of towels.  Breakfast was outstanding -- good variety from one day to the next.  Parking is tricky; the lot fills up in early evening, so I had to park near the office on two night.  The parking spaces are very narrow, so if you have luggage in the passenger area, you have to unload it before you pull into the parking space.

I am sad to hear that your stay did not exceed your expectations. Our staff is dedicated to providing the best service possible for each and every one of our guests. In reviewing your stay details, I see that we did perform two separate room moves for you, but unfortunately, we were unable to find accommodations to suit your needs and or preferences. We always try our best to accommodate our guests however, during busy seasons, it becomes less possible.   Regarding hotel room rates, we do offer a 30+ plus (monthly) rate, however, your stay dates fell short of 30 nights so unfortunately we were not able to extend you this rate. When booking under 30 nights, our rates do fluctuate and it seems that during the dates of your stay, our Best Available Rate was fluctuating between $169 and $249 nightly due to several dates where the hotel was high occupancy. The guest service agent who made your reservation secured a lower rate for you and offered that same rate nightly. The agent's offer saved you far more than you would have saved with the 10% off you would have received with the AAA or Senior rate.   I wish we could have made your stay better for you.

I will never stay here again.,May 2019,none,none,"Thank you very much for the feedback on the Chase Suite Hotel Brea. I am saddened that you were not able to enjoy your stay with us due to some of the challenges you experienced at the property. Group bookings are bound to hotel agreements and unfortunately, we could not accommodate the group's last minute request to cancel the first night of a two night stay for the 26 rooms that were booked. Our hotel manager was however, gracious enough to allow you to change your Friday/Saturday night reservation to a Saturday/Sunday reservation which we typically would not allow. Although Sunday night was at a lower rate, you were still bound to the group rates you originally booked with us per our group rate agreement. As far as the issue with the bug bites, we alerted our maintenance crew and housekeeping department the minute you informed the front desk. Unfortunately, our crew did not find any evidence of insects in the room and believe it may have happened as a result of playing on the baseball field. We would have been more than happy to move our guests in any situation such as this one, however, due to the size of your group, we did not have any vacant rooms during your stay that were similar to the room type you had booked.

I want to apologize if you feel we felt short of your expectations while you stayed with us during your two night reservation. In looking at our notes, I don't see you had a chance to contact our front desk about any connectivity issues to our WiFi. We  pay a very reputable company to make sure we don't fall short in this area as this is a basic need for our guests. We urge all our guests to contact us if anything like not connecting is a problem so we can fix it right away. We have had this company over 5 years and 100% of the time they are able to address any issues with success, but if we don't know, we can't fix it.

We always do our very best to accommodate all of our guests and their requests during a stay. The reason we ask for a 24 hour notice for our shuttle is to assure availability and to assure no schedule conflicts within our hotel guests. In regards to the late checkout request, we have our policies in place that will offset late turn over of suites and incurred costs of labor due to late checkouts as it does cause a lot of issues especially when we are running a hotel that is sold out on a daily basis. Although it may seem petty, a late checkout does cause a lot of change to our operation and smooth running for new arrivals and departures. I also apologize if the construction may have been a little noisy as we do schedule it from 9am-6pm, M-F to avoid it disturbing our guests.

It was quiet and the air conditioner worked beautifully, keeping us comfy although it was 90 outside. The second time we were on the first floor of building two.

However my first room smelled awful and the door hit the bed when I opened it to go in... that is how small the room was! I would suggest making sure you are booking a suite if you are considering this hotel, a single queen is a TINY room! Also, some rooms have the A/C units directly under the window in front of the bed... very noisy and can keep you up all night if you are a light sleeper. As far as service, one of my coworkers is alergic to down and the hotel apparently didn't have any thing synthetic for her so she had to sleep on a towel. Bummer! Where is the customer service in that??",March 2009,none,none,We are glad you enjoyed our complimentary breakfast.

1 helpful vote,7 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Worked out Great!!!,"My brother and I were back in Whittier for a family celebration.  Being over 40, we prefer to have our own personal space.  The two bedroom suite was just what we needed ($119/night including breakfast).  Chase Suites was clean, quiet (considering you are on Imperial Blvd), conveniently located to business, tourist attractions and family, and just what we needed to spread out and enjoy our stay.  We noticed a night security guard patrolling the parking lot, and appreciated the extra cautions when a group of teenagers/college girls rolled up with overnight bags.  Even though some boys showed up later, there were no issues with this group.  Hope this helps.",March 2009,none,none,Thank you very much for the feedback.

Had to go to pomona, so brea was a good location to stay in (i think it took 25 minutes to get there) and it was pretty close to Disney ( i think 20- 25 minutes).",January 2009,none,none,"Thank you for the review and thanks again for choosing to stay at the Chase Suite Hotel Brea!

none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"SCALE OF 1-10, THIS HOTEL GETS AN 8","I I knocked off a couple of points only because it did not live up to my personal expectations as for size.  I like spacious suites w/balconies, which is why I always book suites  w/balconies.  This one was a lot smaller than what it appears on the website.  The website also advertises that all rooms “feature” balconies.  No balconies here, unless they consider the stoop outside the front door a balcony.   Which was O. K. if you want to step out for a breath of fresh air.   Other than that, really cozy, neat and quiet, for a couple, that is. My suite was a one-bedroom with two TVs.  The TVs look ok but are not up to date w/technology.  I hooked up my portable DVD player but the TV did not receive it.  The second T.V. was even older.  Loved  the full Kitchen. Loved it!
