I appreciate the feedback about the location, and even more so, the kind words about the staff. They are AMAZING hard-working people who try their hardest to make sure your stay is memorable. Those big jetted tubs in the rooms (from 1985) - are on their way out! About 1/2 of the rooms no longer have those tubs and as we renovate we are replacing them with a much smaller tub. We have a plan in place to renovate the rest of our rooms, diligently removing that ""80's vibe"" from those remaining rooms. ;0) There are different ""rules"" in place for our timeshare guests and our renters. Timeshare guests do receive a mid-week towel/linen exchange and renters receive daily maid-service. The strict 10am check-out time is on Sundays only, we are more flexible mid-week. I believe most hotels/resorts have a security deposit required at check-in, ours is $100, it's in all of our documentation. I'm glad you took advantage of our FREE bike rentals, it really is the best way to explore the area. But we definitely do NOT recommend playing ""frogger"" to cross PCH, there is a traffic signal less then 2 blocks down where you can safely cross the street with the bikes (no stairs) to access the beach path. And next time you stay with us, please mention that someone will be using the pull-out sleeper, we can add a pillow-topper that makes the pullout mattress more comfortable. I hope you and your family enjoyed your stay with us, had a memorable & fantastic vacation, and will return to stay with us again!  Again, we ALWAYS appreciate feedback and you taking your time to share your opinions with fellow travelers.  Amanda Burgess, General Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,122,346

There are positives and negatives with this property, though since we keep coming back, obviously the positives out weight the negatives. It is an older California beach property.

I feel that the folks at Trading Places did us a disservice  by failing to inform us that the $764.00 for a week in this place would have us facing a mound of dirt in the back of the resort. Nowhere in the Confirmation that we received, nor in the information pages of the resort is there any mention that ex-changers would end up in one of these substandard units. Also, after registering our complaint with the manager at the Inn, we were informed that Trading Places was responsible for informing incoming guests that they had 30 days in advance of their arrival to ""request"" an ocean facing unit. Trading Places did NOT inform us of that either.  Having been a",January 2016,none,none,"Hello Mr. Miller, Anytime you do a timeshare exchange, I recommend that once you have a confirmed exchange you contact that resort directly to ask them how they assign the rooms. Every resort does it a different way. The exchange paperwork states that you are not guaranteed a particular view. However, we allow our owners to call in 3 months in advance of the arrival date to request a room assignment and exchange guests to call in 1 month in advance of the arrival date to request a room assignment. We have no record of you calling in, you arrived on check-in day assuming that you would have an ocean-view. Since this is a resort where a majority of the owners use their week rather then give it to the exchange companies, sometimes even calling 1 month in advance won't guarantee you ocean-view because the owners have reserved them all. Despite being in a non-ocean-view room I hope you found the resort to be clean and well maintained and the staff to be professional, helpful and friendly. I hope you took advantage of our free bikes and enjoyed all that this beautiful beach town has to offer. You rated our resort as a 2, but your review indicates your grievance is not with the resort but with the exchange company. I do hope you come back to stay with us again in the future and if so please call us 1 month in advance of your arrival date so we can assign an ocean-view room to you if one is available.

They've made several updates since our last stay and the place looked great! The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed the free bike rentals and Wi-Fi. The rooms are nicely decorated and being right next to the beach is fabulous! The only downside is being right next to the train tracks, but the noise wasn't actually that bad. There's a nice little bar (Sunsets) within walking distance for watching the sunset.

Here are the good and bad: Pros: 1.great location. Easy to get to Disneyland, San Diego or LA. Great central local.            2. 1bdrm was very roomy. Loved the 2 person jacuzzi with padded headrest.   Comfortable bed. Very clean. Balcony nice with grill included.            3. Great views of the ocean and beach right across the street. Not crowded at all so very relaxing place and beach.            4. small # of units so very quiet and easy paced. Didn't hear any trains! Cons: 1. Kitchen was horribly disfigured. Limited untensils, hard to cook due to layout of the very tiny kitchen.             2. Nothing much for eats within walking distance or even short drive.

While it was very clean and had everything one needed, the furnishings were definitely dated.   There was a small balcony that looked out on the beach, but between the building and the beach was the busy highway and train tracks.  The street noise almost never stopped, and the rooms were small and felt a little bit claustrophobic.  We did love the Capistrano Beach area and would definitely recommend a trip to the old mission in San Juan Capistrano, just a short distance away.  There is so much to do in this area.  We had a great day trip to San Diego and drove as far north as Santa Barbara, which was wonderful.  Unfortunately the weather was cool so we got in  no beach time.

Very close to great restaurants, shopping, and attractions/activities at San Clemente, Dana Point and San Juan Capistrano.

The check in experience was very slow due to a lack of help at the check in desk.  Also desk staff was often on personal calls and was not very attentive when we had questions.   The whole building had a bad musty order, it was tolerable with all the windows open, but our  room over looked the parking lot of the restaurant next door so often it was too noisy to keep the windows open.

We have always been able to trade our timeshare for a property nearby.  This year we were not able to trade so we initially booked a hotel for the week. However after being there one night we did not want to stay the week at the hotel.  We saw the Surfside Inn and the sign out front said vacancy so we talked with them and they had a 2-bedroom unit available for the rest of our stay.  We were very thankful to stay at this property.  FIrst the staff is so helpful and friendly.  Also for the price we paid per night it was a great value--the room we were in was recently painted and very clean.  We loved having 2 bedrooms and 1 1/2 baths with a full kitchen and living area.  It makes your stay,July 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,195,346
6 helpful votes,4 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible letdown...,"We booked through our local resorts' Trading Places agent. This was promised to be a 5-star resort, but when we checked in we were very disappointed. The night before arriving at the Surfside, we stayed at the Doubletree in Commerce, CA that was rated at 3-1/2 stars by Hotwire and was twice as nice as this. To realize you're stuck for a week someplace that's not what you're promised is extremely frustrating. This is no better than a 2 to 3 star--at best!   Once we arrived and even before getting to our room, the odor getting off the elevator was disgusting--and didn't get better all week. We asked for another room within 5 minutes of arriving, and they did let us see the only other room available. That room smelled like someone had been cleaning fish there for days. Our room",March 2008,none,none,"We have a 5 star resort. Timeshare rating is very different then hotel ratings and this was explained to the guest. We may not have a tennis or basketball court, but the amenities we do offer (free bikes, free VHS, free exercise room, pool/ Jacuzzi) are well maintained and clean. I receive positive feedback from owners and guest on a weekly basis on how clean the resort is and how nice it looks. The front desk agent offered to move this guest to another room, I believe the guest was looking to be moved to an oceanfront room but our ocean front units were booked. The agent that showed him the room did not detect a bad smell in the unit or in the hallway. Our carpets are in fairly good condition as they are cleaned frequently. All the pictures that were posted with this review were fixed by maintenance when they were reported.  In addition to this, several of our units have been renovated within the last two months.

For example they have beach chairs, beach toys, pool toys, games, books, bikes, and videos for the guests to ""borrow"".

The resort has underground parking, but we never experienced a problem with finding a spot. There is a nice pool and hot tub out front but it was cool outside and they were too cool to use despite the pool being heated. It rained quite a bit while were were there which resulted in terrible mudslides earlier this year.
