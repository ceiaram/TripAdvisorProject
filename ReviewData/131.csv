24 helpful votes,18 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Functional but needs fixing.,An older property does make this somewhat unique. It’s only 2 floors and unlike most actually had a courtyard. Odd-numbered rooms face outward while even-numbered rooms face in the courtyard. I was kind expecting there to be no elevator but to my surprise there are 2. One on each side. The one closer to my room (269) had a fan on and has a delayed start going up. The other elevator does not have these. Both are not very clean and one (forget which) has cracks in the floor. Room was decently sized although the lack of lights on the ceiling kinda shows this place’s age and the bathroom was a bit messy. The pool and fitness center are nice looking but I didn’t use them. The hotel’s proximity to Knott’s Berry Farm may make it hard to get in or out when something is going on there.,October 2021,EV charging is available and is near Knott’s berry farm so long lines may occur.,Traveled with family,Thank you for your feedback.

Also, its location on Beach Blvd with of all its surrounding attractions (along with the blinding Vegas-like lights that line the street) does not let you forget that you are in the middle of a busy and loud part of town with tourists and travelers coming in and out at all hours of the day.

I was a able to get a sweet deal via Priceline, but would not have a problem payring a higher rate. The hotel is smaller and easy to navigate.  Disneyland was about 10 minutes away.  So was the ballpark.   We never went to Knotts Berry Farm, but one could certainly walk there from the hotel. The pool was clean and hardly used.  My kids had a blast.   The rooms were rather spacious and clieaned quite well each day of our 5 day visit.  Staff is sparse, but who needs 'em anyway?    Don't expect too much from the breakfast.  Adults are $8.95 and kids are $3.95.  I thought that was too steep so we never ate there. If you want to be in the spotlight, this hotel may not be for you.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,294,131
34 helpful votes,9 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,A great stay and awesome location.,"A great location in Buena Park.  Right next to Knott's Berry Farm.  In fact, you can hear the screams from the rides if you open your windows, so be prepared to keep em closed.  The breakfast was good and I love the hi-speed internet access for FREE!  For dinner, if you like Korean, there's a place across the street and just south, which is fantastic.  You'll love it.  The staff at Courtyard was friendly and I had no problems.  I'd stay here again.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,295,131

We first stayed there when we went to Midieval Times (which is right across the street). We chose this hotel because of the proximity to MT and because it offered a free hot breakfast. We were pleasantly surprized and amazed as to what this free breakfast included. Just about anything you want you can get. Freshly made waffles, omletes, etc...The thing I really like is that our server has always been the same lady, so she must enjoy working there. Which to me shows something for the place. We have stayed there 3 or 4 times since on trips to Knotts and Wild Bill's and would recommend this to anyone.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,296,131
