It isn't a bad place to stay and the price is right, but there are just so many little things that keep it from being a four or five star location. One big drawback is the paid parking, $28/day is fairly steep.  The hotel itself is unremarkable. It has a nice enough lobby, but with massive pillars in the line area for registration that makes it seem claustrophobic.

The hotel is very nice - we were in a recently updated room and it was clean and nicely laid out, with a small coffee maker.  We inquired about a room with a fridge to keep a few items we had brought with us cold, and were told it was an additional $10 per night, which we didn't feel was worth it.  The major ding I had was that there was an intermittent (several times and hour) high pitched squealing sound (maybe water pipes???) that woke me up numerous time during the night.

none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good for business - limited food nearby,I have stayed in this hotel a few times for business.  Overall it has good accommodations and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Here are a few specific things to be aware of: 1.  Rooms are in good condition except for electrical outlets on the lamp bases which frequently don't work.  Carry an extension cord.  I like a cool room for sleeping and the AC worked better than most hotels.    2.  The lower floor rooms (<6) near the entrance of the hotel can get some outside noise.  Try to choose floors 7-10 on the pool end for more quiet. 3.  There are a couple of restaurants within walking distance and some which deliver.  The hotel restaurant/room service has a reasonable menu and food quality is OK.
