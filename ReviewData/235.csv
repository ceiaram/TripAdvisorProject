In this case I received two incident reports because of your negative interactions with two staff members. While investigating the incident report, I spoke with both employees and 4 guests. The reason you were asked to leave was for making inappropriate and hurtful comments to other guests. Like telling poor Max that his mother didn't love or want him, or telling Ryan that everyone talks behind his back and thinks he is annoying or telling everyone that Jon is on drugs (when you know he take pride in his sobriety). These toxic and painful attacks were hurtful and mean. They were unnecessary and false. As human beings it is our obligation to love others, not hurt them. This is a cornerstone of  House of Trestles. To be a place of healthy and meaningful relationships. I realize that being asked to leave can be an intense sense of rejection and for that I do apologize. While we have to take all guests experience into consideration, it is always difficult to ask a guest to leave. It is also a risk having retaliatory reviews. As this is a perfect case and point.

Early check-in was not a problem (no other hostel was able to check me in earlier on my long trip so this is really special) and the staff was really helpful and friendly all the time. I felt really comfortable right from the beginning! All in all its a clean hostel and the ""box-styled"" beds with the curtains give you a lot of privacy even when you are in a shared room.

The staff is very warm and welcoming, they go above and beyond to make sure you feel like your part of the Trestle family. The price per night is outrageously low and includes a small continental breakfast in the morning. If you're like me and need a cup of Joe to wake up don't bother going to Starbucks, there coffee is spot on. They have an industrial stove and refrigerator so you can save even more money not having to go out to eat. Just go shopping and make your own food.

Surf classes were not offered.,November 2017,none,none,"Emilie, I am baffled by your review. you stayed for 2 nights/3 days. The second night we covered half the cost of your stay because you were short on funds. During your stay we fed you and showed you nothing, but kindness. The second night you started having some bizarre episode, with outbursts towards other guests. We worked to deescalate the situation. The third day you were walking the halls, talking to yourself and having outbursts. At one point cussing profanity in the hall-way. I informed you we would be unable to extend your stay, because of your behavior. I gave you an hour to pack your belonging and even helped you pack. During that time you started escalating, cussing at guests and staff. On the way out of the door you screamed ""F you guys"" and pulled the fire alarm, creating quite an ordeal. Last night we received a call from you like nothing had happened and asking if we had space for you. This was 2 days after you wrote this review.

Had a good laugh with the boys up from Chili doing the art work (brilliant). Fully functional kitchen and fridges available to everyone. Clean bathrooms and showers. Come n go as you please.

Josh and Addison are the sweetest men with incredible vision, who just want you to have the best time. They are authentic, compassionate, and incredibly wonderful.

Josh and Addison have created an incredible place that truly feels like home.  The place itself is clean, safe and beautiful as it is covered in incredible artwork.  Close to the beach and to Trestles, the area is perfect.  However, what makes this a standout place is the community of people it brings together.  Through morning yoga and nightly events, everyone is brought together and made to feel like family.  You are greeted and treated like family when you walk through the doors and by the time you leave you are already planning your next trip back.
