Pros :: close to Disney, free hot breakfast and happy hour, fridge in room and table and chairs for eating. Cons :: fridge could be much colder (not sure about the safety of keeping food such as deli meats and milk in it), and the happy hour treats seemed to be lacking compared to other Embassy Suites we've stayed.  However, we got a good night's sleep, the hotel is quiet, and we had a quick and easy drive to Disney each day.  Yes, there is a shuttle, but for the cost of what it would be to purchase tickets for all of us, it was cheaper to drive our car and park across the street at one of the smaller, non-brand hotels and then just walk to the park.

The second night, I woke up to doors slamming every five or so minutes, starting at 6 am. I assume this was because of all the small children given the proximity to Disneyland. It brought back bad memories of staying near Disneyworld. Anyway, I didn't fault the hotel for this, but just keep this in mind if you like to sleep in. I stayed in 920 which was in a hallway off the main atrium. I think this may have reduced some of the general noise.   The gentleman at the front desk was very nice and helpful.

It's a nice place; very spacious lobby. The rooms are large and comfortable, and you just touch the room key to a sensor to open the door. The only issue we had was the tv channels freezing up all the time.  Seemed to be every channel, every five minutes or so, so that was annoying. Some sort of reception or satellite problem I imagine. It was late though so it wasn't too much of an issue.  This is a great Disney off-property hotel. Breakfast is also good and free. Parking fee is a bit obnoxious considering the room rates.

From the moment we pulled up, to the moment we left, staff were attentive, smiling, friendly and helpful. Great staff!  The hotel is gorgeous, and pristine, including the suites.  We were changing in and out of costumes, so it was very helpful to have the large bathroom, and two rooms.  The closet was adequate, and  we appreciated the iron and ironing board for last minute touch ups. A nice surprise was the magnifying mirror in the bathroom - perfect for putting on 1940's makeup at 4:00 a.m. when one is a bit bleary-eyed. We used the fridge and kitchen area as well.

Breakfast was very good, particularly the cooked-to-order omelets! Service in the bar/restaurant was great.  As others have commented, the location is good--the difference is that, instead of doing a lot in Anaheim, we appreciated the proximity to the freeways to easily get to the beaches. We also enjoyed seeing Disney fireworks from the property.  The only real complaint I'd have is the elevator situation, with very long waits, and no way to take the stairs to/from the lobby.

We showed up on a Wednesday evening around 11:00pm. The drop-off driveway was being repaved so it was blocked off. Since it was late, most parking spots near the lobby entrance were taken. We parked a ways off, grabbed our luggage and went to check in. Once checked in, we were given a parking pas--which we needed to go back out to place on the dashboard. We were asked if an attendant had met us in the lot upon arrival to give us a tag and we said ""no"".

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Embassy Suites Stay,"I was on a short business trip in Santa Ana last week with two associates.  We stayed at the Embassy Suites in Orange, CA.  The hotel was immaculate.  My suite was spacious, clean, and very comfortable.  We had dinner that night. I ordered the Salmon.  It was probably 6 ozs. grilled to perfection, not dry, but cooked enough.  The vegetable side was hot and crunchy, as it should be.  I used the workout facilities the following morning.  They had a good mix of cardio equipment, nautilus equipment and free weights; which enabled me to get the optimum workout. The complimentary cook to order breakfast i had after my workout was excellent.  For those interested in eating healty, there were plenty of options from oatmeal, cold cereal, bagels, and fruit.

Went online and got a 2 bedroom suite with a sofa bed for a great price, using gov't rate. Checked in and man was extremely rude. Told him 4 adults and he charged for 2 extra adults even though our room slept 6! I feel that he was bitter because we found the lower rate online. The property was very nice and recently remodeled. Chris in valet was awesome as were the breakfast chefs. I wish I had names, but the man at the front desk was rude during check in and a woman at the front desk was rude at check out. Also, our ""2 bedroom suite"" had 1 bedroom with a door and the other bedroom connected to the living room without a door.

6 helpful votes,10 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Look no further,"Previous posts detailed problems during remodeling and in many cases less than accommodating service people.  Those issues are all in the past.  After a five-day stay in mid-March I can report that this is one of the finest Embassy Suites we've ever encountered.  Rooms were large, well-appointed, with crystal-clear HDTVs in living room and bedroom, large new fluffy towels and amenities in the bathroom.  Adjacent to I-5 but very quiet, even in the rooms facing the freeway.  Generous unlimited drinks during 2-hour manager's reception and nice hot breakfast with cooked to order eggs and omelets.  Reasonably priced shuttle to Disneyland yet, amazingly, very few kids were in the hotel during our stay.  This property exceeded every expectation and I recommend it highly.",March 2014,none,none,"Thank you for your great comments regarding our hotel.

I really liked the old hotel and the new look and feel is taking some time to sink in.  After a moment of silence I'll focus on the new hotel....   Check in was somewhat disorganized.  I'll blame this on new staff and new computer systems and expect it to get better.  Check out was a breeze.  Front desk staff was very attentive to every request.  Free breakfast and manager's reception was Embassy Suites standard quality (it's free and good).

First time was a few years ago when it was a Hilton.  I think the renovations are done but I didn't notice too much difference.  Paid $169 + $13 for parking per night.  POSITIVES :   - Suite style gives privacy when you are traveling with more than one person.  Bedroom is large and a door that closes completely and separates the sofa bed and office desk room.  There are large LCD tv's in each room. - Comfy bed, Relatively new sofa and furniture - Lots of electrical outlets.
