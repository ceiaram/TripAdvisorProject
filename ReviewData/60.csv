none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hidden Gem in Disneyland Resort Area,"Hyatt House was a phenomenal option for a short Disneyland trip for my wife and me.   Before I selected this property, I read some of the reviews - and the only feedback people had that was negative seemed to be a “smell” in the elevators and some wear on furniture, etc. in the room. I can confirm a smell in the elevator, but to us it felt more like an industrial cleaner-type smell - likely tied to the laundry, etc, which I assume is at the basement level (speculation) - and honestly it was not bad at all - some folks clearly over exaggerated that. And as to the wear, sure there were some chipped edges of drawers and walls, but knowing how close this property is to Disneyland - it’s honestly impressive how well-kept it is considering how many families with kids must come",March 2023,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,60

The room met our family’s needs well, check in and out was smooth and it was a short walk to Disneyland.  We love the King and bunk configuration and had plenty of space.  The main reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that both when we arrived and when our room was serviced mid-stay, the top bunk was left unmade.  Especially surprising mid-stay since it was clear someone was sleeping there.  It was upsetting for my daughter and a bit challenging and unexpected that we had to make our bed at the hotel, certainly in this price range.  The breakfast was also rather uninspiring.

The bed was probably the worst I have slept in at a hyatt, so incredibly hard and uncomfortable. This made the walk to the parks very difficult each day.

The room itself was pretty run down, for example,  the dresser drawers finish was chipped and wouldn't stay shut. So we just walked around them open all week.

I called the hotel and was put on hold for 20 minutes after which they claimed it was an accidental charge and would be refunded.

We could hear our neighbors entire conversations and I’m sure we also annoyed them with our loud toddler.

I’ve been here for two days, and both days the water in both the pool and the spa were very murky and smelled foul. Clearly they’ve not been taken care of, no chlorine in either. In fact, the spa water is about three or 4 inches below normal, and the skimmers are almost taking in air. This is a clear indicator that nobody has been watching over or maintaining the pool and spa for a while. For the prices being paid at this hotel (To include $28 a night to park your car), I would expect it to have a decent pool and spa. Especially considering we're here on vacation in sunny California.

You can take the same shuttle going back. Properly shares a parking lot with another hotel, La Corona.   Hotel: It is small with a tiny lobby & an open business center (3 computers). A tiny outdoor pool (not heated) which resembles those from an Motel 6 and a hot tub. Shuttle also doesn’t come here to take you to Disneyland (others do) so this probably won’t be our choice next time we visit for Disneyland.   Room looks exactly like the picture. Water pressure is really good. But I booked a queen and I think what were in were full beds.   Decent breakfast: scrambled eggs, sausages, pancakes, waffles. Yogurt and some fresh fruits.

Our room was cleaned once while we were there because of our length of stay. The staff was prompt to bring extra towels and TP when they were needed.

Room was spacious and kitchenette was nice to have.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  The free breakfast was decent -- eggs, sausage, potatoes, toast, whole fruit, cereal, and the usual beverages.  And free.  Nice that there is a bar in the lobby though I did not use it. Cons:  Really the only con was the mattress on the sofa pullout is uncomfortable and not suitable for anyone other than a young child IMO.  I had two 10-year olds who, unsolicited, when they stretched out on it said no WAY they would rather sleep with their parent.  The 8-year old was fine with it.

Location and convenience are still the biggest reasons we choose to stay here. The walk to the Disneyland entrance is still the biggest plus and not to mention that Walgreens and Starbucks are nearby.

The walk is close enough to not make it too difficult, but not likely a walk you'd want to do several times a day with kids.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Incredible customer service - and technically I wasn't even a customer!,"We were having dinner across the street from this hotel, just before we were to attend a concert at a venue about 20 minutes away.  The evening was a birthday gift for my husband.  He had always wanted to see this artist, so we traveled from Las Vegas to Anaheim for the weekend and surprised him with tickets to the show.  As we were wrapping up dinner, I pulled up the confirmation for the show on my phone and that's when I realized, we were to have printed the tickets prior to arrival.  I panicked, as we had just enough time to get from dinner to the venue - trying to figure out how to print tickets in between was NOT on the agenda.    In desperation, we pulled up to the Hyatt and I ran to their front desk, hoping they could tell me where the closest Kinko's was.

The rooms were spacious, bathroom large, and large sleeper/sofa (we didn’t use) for sitting and enjoying the Seahawks game.  The rooms (adjoining) were ready upon our early arrival (11am) to allow us to head on over to Disneyland (DL) right away.  The Pool and Hot Tub were clean and warm even in December.

The quality of the facility and service was absolutely fantastic. Disneyland is about a 10 minute walk. Something to keep in mind if travelling with children under 5 years old and you plan to spend several long days at Disneyland is that small children will struggle with the walks to and from the Hyatt House. So please plan and set your expectations accordingly.  The only thing stopping me from give a 5 star review is the house staff kept packing up the sofa bed every day, which meant we had to unpack the sofa bed and make the bed again after a long day at Disneyland.

In regards to your guestroom rate, as you did not book your guestroom through the group block, but with a AAA rate, you did receive the room type that you specifically booked while making the reservation. I'm sorry that you felt the room was small, but your team's coach did negotiate a group rate for our larger rooms, which is why they received our Studios. As your room was not booked through the proper channels to receive the group rate, you did receive the rate that was quoted to you at the time your reservation was made. I would like to offer my sincere apologies that you did not feel that your guestroom was cleaned appropriately. I spoke to our Director of Houskeeping and the 2 housekeepers that cleaned your room regarding this issue. I also asked the housekeepers why your son was not allowed to re-enter the room after they cleaned it. According to our housekeepers and their supervisor, there were no children in the room when they went to clean it. If your son approached the housekeeper afterwards, they would not be able to let your son in due to not knowing if he is an occupant of that room. This is done for the safety of all of our guests in the hotel. When your husband approached the front desk, Alyssa, our supervisor did apologize for the service issues and communicated to your husband that she is happy to offer one drink and one meal at our H Bar on a complimentary basis. As he requested more compensation, she reiterated to him that she is offering him only one drink and one meal and he agreed to that.

We picked Hyatt House because it was a newer hotel and it was about a 10 minute walk to the security checkpoint at Disneyland (or an hour if you include the lines).    Everyone at the hotel was really nice, from the front desk, housekeeping staff, and the employees at breakfast.  The room was very clean and relatively spacious.  There was a large selection of food at breakfast, considering it was free.   They even had almond milk!    Pros  - Clean hotel room - Indoor parking ($18) - Starbucks/ Blaze Pizza/ Walgreens next to the hotel - Hot breakfast options (eggs/sausage/waffles) - Heated pool with lots of fluffy towels  Cons - Pillows could use more support - Toiletries were a bit drying and no lotion provided - Lukewarm blow",May 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1459,60

It appears that your stay did not live up to the expectations that we strive for. The last thing we want to do is give people the impression that we do not care or that we do not empathize with your frustrations. Unfortunately, due to our current weather, it is that time of year that we tend to see ants. The hotel takes many precautions each day to eliminate this issue, however, sometimes these little buggers still find their way into a guestroom.
