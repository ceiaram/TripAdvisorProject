I'm not one to judge or talk unhonestly, but I could not understand them, and they must have been having a bad day because they made me feel so uncomfortable while my boyfriend was out working. I couldn't wait to get out of there. I don't get how they are still in business. Do not stay here. Ewwww. There was hair all over the bathroom floor. Shampoo packages, used, in the shower. We only had one towel, and when we asked for more they were freaking dirty. Tv didn't work. It was a nightmare.

none,2 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mon plus mauvais choix aux USA,"Pour commencer, l'accueil on ne peut plus minimaliste et froid de ce qui semble être la gérante. Ensuite, une odeur sur le couvre lit juste infecte. Le lit heureusement semblait correct. L'eau du lavabo s'évacuait avec lenteur et visiblement l'aspirateur n'avait plus été passé sous le lit depuis des lustres. La télévision qui ne marche pas, sans compter des installations électriques vétustes. Franchement, si on aime pas ce travail, on laisse quelqu'un d'autre s'en charger... Et 55$ la nuit pour ca, c'est du vol.",September 2013,Je ne sais pas pour les autres mais évitez la 5.,Traveled solo,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,2,502

The shower came pre-pubed with a moldy curtain serving as a shower curtain.  The kitchenette was a little shop of horrors - someone else's leftovers were already in there and it looked like someone had just cleaned out their ashtray in the sink.  The furniture looked worse than something purchased at the Goodwill.  I literally draped the headboard with a sheet because it looked so worn (yeah, gross!).  We had camped the previous night and used all of our bedding instead of what was already on the bed.  Given the other clues, it wasn't hard to figure out what this motel is mostly used for and that there isn't a whole lot of cleaning going on between customers.  I hope I can",February 2012,Don't stay here!  You are better off going to the camp site than this place.,Traveled as a couple,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,3,502
