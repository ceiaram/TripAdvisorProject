48 helpful votes,49 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice hotel with helpful employees.,"We stayed while in town for an event. The employees were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast in the morning was very good and included a strawberry mixture for the waffles. The hotel itself was in great condition and very inviting. The rooms were pleasant with upgraded bathrooms. Our room did not have a bathtub which was a little disappointing, but the shower had good water pressure. I didn't love the opaque doors as they let light into the room when someone was inside which was disturbing to those sleeping. It was annoying to pay for parking, but at least it was only $5. There was really no need for it. It wasn't gated or at all secure and seemed like a money grab. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again if in the area.",February 2023,Ask for softer pillows,none,"We really appreciate it when our satisfied guests take the time to post a informative reviews of their experience, particularly on TripAdvisor.

9 helpful votes,18 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Immaculate and Excellent Staff All-Around!!!,"THIS HOTEL SAVED US from the completely disasterous Embassy Suites in Brea! We were away for 2 separate weeks, split up by the weekend for business. We stayed in 2 different rooms. Both were GREAT.   The hotel is immaculate, inside and out (and I'm pretty picky)! When I looked in to see what housekeeping was up to, they were pulling dressers out from the wall and vacuuming behind furniture, cleaning door boarders, and smiling at customers in-between! While working out, I saw housekeeping came in to check on towels and wipe things down.   The free, hot breakfast was nicely done and well-stocked. It was so pleasant at night that my wife and I brought food in and ate in the lobby several times. There's an outdoor fireplace.

none,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Tries but falls short, succumbing to Marriott's signature mediocrity.","As a pilot, I'm a little picky because I spend a lot of nights in hotels. This hotel is relatively new, it ticks all the boxes, but misses the mark in characteristic Marriott mediocrity. Springhill Fullerton experience follows a theme, 'We've given you all the things we promised, what more do you want'?   This property is positioned close to Disney and Knotts. It aspires to be upscale, hitting $195 a night off-peak, and they charge $5 a day for unsecured outdoor parking, pushing the bill above $200/night. Sound insulation is quite effective, which you'll appreciate; the hotel seems rather jammed into a tiny parcel bordered by a busy freeway, rail freight line and industrial artery. There is no formal restaurant on the property or within walking distance.    With designer colors",December 2022,"No jacuzzi, outdoor pool only.

As a pilot, we know your time is valuable and we greatly appreciate the feedback.

As you travel - the slower the better - along that odd stretch of Placentia Avenue, you will see the attractive 5-story hotel building on a hill overlooking the street & the adjacent freeway.  Driving either northbound or southbound on Placentia, ignore any suggestion to turn westbound onto Fender Avenue and instead look for the hotel entrance sign low to the ground on the east side of the street.  From that well hidden entrance, you will find your lodging destination.

Raena made my stay extra special, she was the kindest associate during my week and a half stay. She was more professional and welcoming than any other employee working at the property. Please give her a raise!!   Breakfast was surprisingly decent. There was a nice selection of cereal, milk (no plant based milk), coffee, packaged pastries and muffins, fresh whole fruits, eggs, sausage, microwavable breakfast sandwiches, and yogurts.   My only concern is with the A/C system. The A/C system didn't cool down the room  efficiently. Even after running the system all day the room warmed up immediately after turning it off.

25 helpful votes,47 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Some rooms sleep 6 comfortably.,"SpringHill is a nice choice for families. Some rooms come with 2 queen beds and a sofa/trundle combo. That's right these room sleep 6 nicely. The sofa bed is a bit firm but nice in size. The trundle pulls out if you need an extra space. Both of these options are NOT like sofa beds with the bars making them lumpy and uncomfortable. The breakfast is pretty good with waffle makers and a few choices of other items, like scrambled eggs, sausage, yogurt, muffins, fruit, etc. The location is in an industrial area and there just isn't much very close, but grocery stores and restaurants are about a 5 minute drive.

So we were shocked to change the sheets on our second night and find a huge urine stain that was apparently ignored by housekeeping-a new mattress pad and sheets placed right on top with no attempt to clean it at all. Iâ€™m thinking it must be a health code violation for a hotel to not properly clean bodily fluids and allow another guest to sleep in that. My husband was disgusted.   We moved rooms and were told we would be compensated. Turns out we were given 30% discount off of ONE night for our SEVEN night stay. Unacceptable.
