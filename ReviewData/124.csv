If there was a shuttle it would even be better as it was quite a long walk.  Coming back to the hotel after a whole day in Disneyland can be very tiring.   Hotel was dated but the place was clean.  Beds comfy but I find it was a bit too high. We had some difficulty finding our room on the 1st floor but the cleaning staff were ever so helpful to direct me through their inventory room in the middle of the block to get to the other side of the building.  Which we only found out later that there was a proper walkway in the middle to get through to the other side of the building, facing Westin Hotel.

That, I suspect, is it's main draw.  It is a slightly tired chain motel. The room is comfortable but decidedly aging. The lighting is poor and the air con unit rattles terribly.

First of all, let me say this place is more of a motel than a hotel. The room I was in faced the street, and all I heard were horns honking and cars driving by on the busy street all night. The room itself smelled like a musty dog. The carpets did not seem clean, and the beds were horrible! It was almost like sleeping on a table. Then there’s the walk to Disneyland.  If you walk at a moderate pace it takes about 22 minutes. There’s also two  busy intersections with cross walks on the way there , so it could take longer.

The complimentary breakfast has good options for the family, usually with eggs, some type of breakfast meat, and potatoes (I will say that the potatoes never tasted quite right to us but everything else was good) along with the regular juice, cereal, coffee, and other breads you’d expect at a typical continental breakfast.  If you’re taking your time, it could be about a 10 minute walk to Downtown Disney and another 10 minutes to the parks, but if we were walking fast, we could probably get to the park in under 10.

The hot items were served to us by a staff member to minimize contact and hand sanitizer was available at the door.

You might want to grab the shuttle for a small fee (tickets purchased at hotel gift shop) which is right out the front doors of the lobby.   We chose this option as even the approx. 15 walk after all day at Disney becomes tiring.   The rooms are small but clean and as pictured.   My only complaint is the breakfast.   The food is generic with french toast and waffles kept in a steamer and soggy.  Oatmeal comes from a machine and was terrible.

The linens were crisp, beds comfortable and rooms sufficiently updated.  The room with two queen beds was a bit cramped as they tried to put a small table and chairs in there that it originally probably wasn't designed for.

If you choose to drive the Disneyland parking lot is maybe a mile away. A big plus is that they allowed us to check in early both times we visited. That's appreciated after driving in from the bay area.  Most other hotels don't let you check in early.

The tiny window unit AC had its difficulties keeping my room cool and also kind of smelled like a public toilet. Other than that, nothing too bad about the room.  Breakfast is served for five or so hours - in theory. In reality they make you choose a one-hour time frame when you check in and then you're supposed to only have breakfast during that time each day. So effectively for you there's only a one-hour breakfast window. The breakfast quality was also not great.

We weren't very pleased from several standpoints, but mostly how dark and dingy the rooms are.  Some major updating is needed.  If you are going to spend long days in the Park, and just crash here, you will probably be okay.  Personally, it didn't feel that secure, and we could hear a lot of sounds next door, and from the outside.  People were walking past our outside window all the time.  This is a multi-level motel which was probably built in the late 50's, or early 60's.  For a few more bucks, you can probably get a nice hotel that is more private, and newer.

Lots of food and a great variety. My family was well fed and ready for a day in the park.  Now, I'm not sure how good the AC is. I was there in the winter. It looked pretty old, to be honest.

Always helpful with questions we had and happy to assist in any way they could.  No safes in the room but they have some at the front desk that we used and felt confident leaving items there.   Pool area was beautiful and not heavily used when we were there, probably due to the time of year.   Walk to Disney was exactly as expected, it is not super close but given how much we walked in a day it didn’t seem like a big deal.

They have a shuttle stop right in front but if you're up for a walk, you can wander through the Disneyland Resorts and get to Downtown Disney for park access, or take the monorail. We arrived around 9am on our check-in day and we were pleasantly surprised to discover our room was already available! The only thing we hated was the warming light in the bathroom - it made it sooo hot even if on for only a couple minutes. Other than that the room was great - very clean, roomy, and had all the necessary essentials.

That being said, if you plan on entering through downtown Disney it is approximately a 10-15 minute walk.

The good:  Location - easy walking distance to Disneyland Pools - On our down days we start off at the pools before we go out to the beaches and most of the time you will get the pool to yourself because there are 2 to choose from.  Breakfast - Well stocked and the staff do a great job at keeping it clean and orderly.  It gets busy in there!  The picky stuff:  We always book a non-smoking room, but we have experienced smokers on the balcony outside our door in each of the past 2 years. The staff are quick to address it but it still happens.  It would be great if it was a non smoking hotel.  $10/day to park.

Unfortunately, this trip (September, 2017) saw some disappointing changes. Most prominently has been the quality of the food. In the past, the continental breakfast has been great, nothing fancy but good and convenient. This trip the food has been almost inedible -- strange concoctions of egg substitute, limited protein, and day old french toast. In addition, guests are now required to reserve specific timeframes for breakfast, which is inconvenient and can prevent you from getting to the park before rope drop.

The hotel parking lot set up was a little inconvenient. When we got to the room the power button on the remote didn't work. The shower nozzel felt like it was about to break and looked really cheap. There was also the incident with their contential breakfast. While sitting trying to enjoy our breakfast outside we noticed that there were random sketchy looking people helping themselves to the breakfast and were sitting in the breakfast area. It was unpleasant and it was clear as I even heard one of the men laughing about stealing food because he could do it so effortlessly.

We went out all day to find our room door had not been properly closed by housekeeping and we could access without the use of a key. We reported this to reception but they said our beds hadn't been made because there was something on there. I explained again that the room had been serviced but the door had not been shut properly. The staff member suggested that someone else in the party had possibly left it open. I replied that there were only two of us and we left the room together checking as always that the door was shut.Then two days later after being out for most of the day our room hadn't been serviced.

We stayed two nights at Best Western Stovall's Inn and I have to say that our stay was enjoyable.

We didn't hear any noise while we were in the room which was great.   The complimentary breakfast was good! Bacon, potatoes, with juice was good.

Also, we were greeted with a terrible smell.  We think the smell was coming from the outdated cranky air conditioning unit that made a terrible noise and a light indicated the filter needing changing. This also leaks water so you can't put anything underneath it. Other faults included a broken toilet roll holder and a bulb not working above the sink.  The room had a dirty feel to it and the toilet door had marks on it.

This hotel is situated across the street from Disneyland so nice and close but still quite a walk if you are a senior.     The hotel has two pools and hot tubs which for the most part are not too busy overall. One good heads up I can tell you is if you want a room on the ground floor directly across from the pool ask for a room from 440 up to 450.  They are directly across.        The hotel has a half decent free breakfast buffet , which makes up for the 10 dollar a day parking charge.  Still very fair when you consider parking elsewhere.

The breakfast room was large and had a good selection of foods. The bathroom was small but adequate. The room had a great kitchenette type area with a fridge for the kids snacks and drinks. The only minor issue we had was the room got quite humid and stuffy with the aircon on which made the windows fog up. The drink machines were well priced , the pool area had nicely trimmed animal shaped hedges which looked great. Walking distance to numerous restaurants and downtown Disney.

The walk to Disneyland was about 15 minutes each way but I found out that you can cut through The Grand Californian and shave a couple minutes off the walk. The walk back each night was a bit more rough since you spend all day walking through the parks but it's not like you are in any hurry. The bed was super comfy and room was clean. The room has a small refrigerator and a microwave as well as a desk with chair and a small table to eat at.

My main reason for booking this motel was the location. It was the closest we could get to the start/finish area of the races without booking a Disney hotel.   We arrived around 9:00 at night and were able to check in quickly. We received a room on the ground floor which is what I had requested. A roll away bed was quickly brought to our room despite the late hour. They had to remove the small table and chairs in order for it to fit. We missed having the table but really there was no other way to fit the roll away bed in there so it was worth the sacrifice.

Generally we spend a week in California splitting our time between Disneyland and San Diego. On this trip we changed our hotel from The Castle Inn and suites mainly because they raised their rates after their remodel and the property does not justify the increase.

The biggest problem this hotel has is that you can hear the adjacent rooms as if there was no wall at all. You will hear every toilet flush, baby crying, kids tantrum, TV and door slam form the room next to you. We stayed in room 335 for a week, and had 3 different families next door and we could hear everything that happened in the room.  Some of the other problems: The WiFi was terrible. It would cut out all the time and when you could stay connected it was dog slow.

The spa/pool closes before the Disney parks do, so don't plan on using them after a long day on your feet.

The beds are comfortably firm and rooms are OK in size for sleeping, which if you are coming to do the parks, is all you need. Location is great for Disney and shuttle is the way to go, stops right in front of the hotel for $5/all day pass. Shower/bath combo is nice.

It was a bit further than I anticipated or wanted after a full day at Disneyland but the kids were troopers.  It's not on the main street of hotels.  I also anticipated the continental breakfast being just bagels, donuts, fruit and beverage.  We were pleasantly surprised to have more (eggs, sausage, cereals, yogurts) which saved us a lot of time and money to hurry and get to Disneyland.  Donuts were really bad.  Muffins good.  Be prepared to have noise from the A/C (Cooler) on all night.  It didn't bother us a bit as we were all exhausted but if noise bothers you, be prepared.

It's obviously less convenient for other LA-based attractions (visitors often don't realise how vast the city is - in bad traffic it can easily take 90+ minutes to get to Hollywood from here) but counterbalance that against the price differential from more central locations - you won't stay anywhere which is remotely as good as this for the same price in Hollywood or the more popular beaches.",September 2012,none,none,Thank you for your review.

I've decided I like staying on this end of the parks more than across the street on Harbor, because a walk through the Grand Californian and Downtown Disney is much more pleasant and magical than a trek through the Harbor mess.  It's a bit farther to walk, but I'll take the distance for the nice atmosphere.  This hotel has recently been upgraded and the rooms are stylish, comfortable and well-equipped.

Why?  Because I've stayed in other hotels in this area that were worse, and being an average hotel in a high demand location like this makes it relatively above average.  We (two adults, two kids under 9) stayed here for 4 nights.  Our primary reason for selecting a hotel in this area was for the close proximity to Disneyland.    Location: This was our first time staying on the south side of Disneyland.  On previous trips we stayed on the east side, very close to the front entrance.

As for the claim of overselling the parking lot, we do not actively oversell our parking lot. Due to our location and our proximity to Disneyland and the convention center, we may experience limited parking availability during our peak summer months as some guests may bring multiple cars during their stay.  For this inconvenience, my front desk manager offered Reward Points or a return visit at a discounted rate which was declined by the guest. This good faith gesture was not an attempt to buy the guest off but rather compensate the guest for the inconvenience he encountered during his stay. As for possible resolutions to dissuade future guests from bringing multiple cars, ownership has decided against penalizing guests with multiple cars. Rather than charge higher fees for multiple cars, the decision to charge a flat fee for all vehicles has been implemented since March of 2010.  Regarding the second issue involving the shower faucet, a front desk supervisor personally assisted the guest and demonstrated how to access the water in the shower. Please know I will research the issue involving the shower faucet and inquire about the feasibility of having signs made for future guests explaining how to use the faucets in the bathroom.

The doors are all on the outside (had a large gap at the bottom) and is extremely small inside (barely enough room to walk around beds) and there was never enough parking.  Parking shared with near by restaurant.  The air conditioner was a wall unit and the insulation was hanging from it so there was an inch gap peaking to the outside.

The rooms are large, which is a plus on a long stay.  Our room was always cleaned by 12:00 each day when we returned for lunch.  We were not woken-up by excessive noise or maids arriving early.  The front desk was not exceedingly friendly, but nor were they rude.  The continental breakfast was not all that great, but there was plenty of food and a wide range of options.

It is nothing special, but is wonderful if you will be in the Disneyland Park most of the day.  During my stay I ran into a few problems, first, when I checked in I requested that there be internet in the room (it is free) and I was placed in a non internet room. Which was one of the reasons for my stay. I was moved promptly and without fuss from the front desk staff.  The rooms are reasonably spacious, thy offer three chairs, a desk, and table.

The hotel has a continental breakfast everyday.  The food consisted of muffins, danishes, toast, cereal, coffee, tea, juice or milk.  Some of the hotels we have stayed at boasted about the breakfast but when you got there the food was all gone - not here.  There was always plenty.  The room was nicely appointed with 2 queen beds, airconditioning, and a sink in the main room. The bathroom was a bit small but how much room do you really need?  The kids enjoyed the pools.

I was a little nervous about how this would be received but to my surprise it was not a problem  even though they had their work cut out for them sorting it out with Best Western International. The room was quite as I had expected, your basic budget motel room with no frills but comfortable none the less.

I found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. When I made my reservation, the man on the phone was nice and accomodating. The room was a motel room, just like any other motel room I've stayed in. It was not the motel staff's fault that this patron had broken his or her back. If he or she wanted special treatment, he or she should have paid a little more and stayed in an upscale hotel. As for demanding that the staff lug his or her bags around. That is not their job or their problem. I think you can tell what kind of person this is just by reading the comments.

The place was pretty crowded with families, but it was not too noisy.  I noticed on some of the rooms that the screens have been bent.   I had read the reviews about the smell (the musty odor was definitely present), so I took my own room freshener and that seemed to take care of it.   The pool and jacuzzi looked clean, too.
