The perks of this hotel having free breakfast, modern rooms, and a close walk to Disneyland really make it the greatest value hotel in the area in my opinion. Rooms were very clean as well.

First impression: I was told to wear a mask in the lobby--after several hours at Downtown Disney where masks weren't required. It's March 2022.  Someone there needs to tell their Corporation that masks never really worked and just about everybody else doesn't care anymore. With that said, the employees were pleasant, saw to our minimal needs, and did their jobs--I applaud them. Next, tiny parking lot, though spots were available.

It is a smaller hotel with about 37 rooms. The parking lot is atrocious! 37 rooms and there not even 37 spots in the parking lot. 3 or 4 of the spots are literally parking in the driveway where everyone pulls in. When there is a car parked on each side you have literally barely enough room for one car to come in and out of the driveway. Is it free? Yes, but you will want to Uber everywhere if you are lucky enough to get a spot when you check in.  The Room - We were in room 105, which happened to be right next to housekeeping.

However, one of the travel sites claimed that it was .3  miles to Downtown  Disney, which is probably true (as the crow flies). When I looked on a map, it seemed like we would be able to walk straight down a path to Downtown Disney--no big deal.  In reality, the Mickey and Friends parking structure and a large employee parking lot are between this hotel and Downtown Disney, which means you actually have to walk more than a mile to get to the park.  It's do-able, but not what I expected, and since I've had 17 surgeries in the past 3 years, it was a little bit more than I could handle.  I felt like I'd been lied to.

We do have new staff in property and maybe we need to further our training.  The reason I see rooms were at higher rate, was because of the ""communication problem"" from booking.com.  If you experience different rate then the one booking.com gave you, please call me as soon as possible to have this fix.   3.  I checked the toilet, and seems maintenance already replaced the water filler pump. I really hope it wasn't a big inconvenience as i don't have any notes about the toilet.  I am sorry we dint see and or fix the problem before you guys checked in.  4.  I understand the frustration being on the third floor and not getting the elevator quickly. I want to apologize this incident happened during your stay but it does not happen often.  We have a service contract with ""Executive Elevator"" company and they do regular maintenance.  Also we call the company when there is an error or something out of normal is happening.  Front desk does notify the elevator company about the occurring problems and then they dispatch technician asap.  Elevator does get a lot usage and with time the buttons do wear off.  The elevator is properly working and no button issues.  5. Yes there is construction on the back lot, they don not use heavy machinery but do start working by 7 AM.   Management has been working with them, however they follow city guidelines.  Work stops like about 4 pm, so late night construction noise ..none.  I understand you were here for a weekend, Ball Rd can get really busy during the weekend and if you are light sleeper then yes you may need ear plugs. (if you are near the street)  I am sorry that we failed to find a better location for you.   I really feel that we deserve a higher than a 1 star, for our service.  If you can give us a chance to give you an outstanding stay experience please call the hotel directly.  Once again, thank you for the feedback as we use it to better ourselves.

After reading previous reviews, I was worried that we were going to a dumpy hotel. However, when we arrived, the hotel was very clean and updated. We head a king size bed in our room, and the room was newly decorated, with microwave, coffeemaker, and fridge. It also has wireless internet. It was a very nice room. The hotel has free continental breakfast, which was a big seller for us. They have strudels, toast, eggos, cereal, oatmeal, and fruit. There is no ""hot"" food, unless you do it yourself. They have a nice breakfast patio outside as well. We used the hot tub a lot. A definite bonus is that you have a great view of the fireworks from the hot tub. It beats staying in Disney",October 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,524,246

Our family of 4 awoke to a gurgling sound at 11pm.

We demanded a new room, had to move the 2 kids, luggage etc in the middle of the night. In the morning we discussed the incident and asked if it had happened before - we were told ""no"". It appears from other feedback on this site that it has happened before. The best the hotel could do was offer a $25 discount - pittance and certainly not eough to make up for the experience.

I have to admit, I wish I would have done a little bit more research on the hotels in the Anaheim area before picking this one, but it was a last minute choice and was the first one to come up on the Best Western Website. They did offer me a very good deal for our two night stay (I was told it was an airline industry rate, but really don't know if it was or not) and all the staff was extremely friendly.  When they say it's a few blocks from Disneyland, that is true, but it's definitely not a few blocks away from the ENTERANCE to Disneyland.

Besides what some people have already written here about the smells in the rooms of raw sewage and cigarette smoke, not so clean rooms, etc...  We witnessed on several occasions staff of the hotel coming out to yell at different people. We couldn't really tell what was going on and quite frankly didn't really want to know. But we did notice they closed one side of the parking lot to car and foot traffic and put up No Tresspassing signs. Funny thing was that the hotel staff would yell at these people, but they wouldn't yell back, they'd just leave.

This was BY FAR the WORST hotel I have EVER stayed at. Our room was not clean upon check in - and even after it had been ""cleaned"" there were crumbs on the floor near the bed, pubic hair on the bathroom floor near the toilet, and the counter by the sink was dirty. The room smelled overwhelmingly like cleaning product. The staff was unfriendly and very socially awkward. Half of the ammenities listed on the website were not ACTUALLY offered once you reached the hotel.

When I stated that I did not think I should pay for the room the owner said: ""You didn't need the bathtub while you were sleeping"".

First impressions were not so good, the two guys although they seem to try, just are not professional and did not make me feel like i would be particularly safe staying here. The main reason was that they were kinda shifty, we even questioned whether this hotel was actually part of the Best Western chain or had been taken over by these 2 guys who had no clue but kept the Best Western sign up somehow. We were asked if we required the room to be cleaned and politely turned it down simply because of our suspicions.

I'm not sure he understood that it didn't seem very professional to us to have that many people in the room at a time, I'm pretty sure only two of them were employees of the hotel.
