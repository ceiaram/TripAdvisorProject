none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointing stay,5 day stay and house keeping only cleaned room 1 day despite calling front desk to confirm everyday.  Rooms need updating. Mattresses very uncomfortable and stains on the carpet.  Smallest bathrooms I've ever seen at any embassy suite.  Very poor lighting in both rooms.  If you go for breakfest be advised they are strict on end time.  They start closing down promptly at 9am despite people still trying to get food.  Felt bad for a lot of the guests was almost embarrassing how they had to grab food or utensils as workers were taking everything away.  Mentioned this to front desk and they just said they were very strict on end time which seems like a poor way to treat guests.,February 2023,none,none,Thank you so much for your valuable feedback.

My only complaint is the parking arrangements. I paid my $17 a night to self park during my reservation- another add on which I feel is ridiculous, this isn’t a resort. A Ton of other guests didn’t and still self parked for free- the gate system isn’t working so they won’t know I was told. They have taken all of the close parking and reserved it for Valet and inconvenience guests including myself who are Diamond Members by making self parking around the back of the hotel near the blocked off lobby. I have never seen such a cluster at a property.

When I complained about not having a TV at check out, the hotel clerk looked kind of disinterested and really just wanted me to disappear.  Said he'd give me a few points for my trouble.  I guess I wasn't the first one to complain and he was tired of hearing about this.  What kind of hotel has no TV?  You can even get reception at a Motel 6.  Not up to Embassy Suites standards.

After another reviewer's tips i requested a newly upgraded room. I am going to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt to say the rooms must not be updated yet and just the outside of the rooms were being worked on because the rooms were not upgraded there was glue keeping things together and cracks in the sink.

As for the restaurant poor food and service can happen and we will follow up.  Regarding pricing we are lower than other comparable restaurants in the area.   Orange County is expense, but we are comfortable we are priced right when my team delivers consistent food and service.  Our parking gates and procedures were added in late 2014 and there is no question the gates approached straight on are the easiest way to maneuver.

I doubt I will have another",March 2016,none,none,"Dear Jose,  Thank you for your feedback.   So glad you had a great stay overall.   The parking is an answer to challenges in the past where we would run out of spaces with no control.  We determined all of the full service hotels in the market, other Embassy Suites, Doubletree, Marriott, Hilton, etc all charged for parking so we made the change over a year ago.   This has meant only our guests use the lot and we still have a full lot when we run high occupancies.  We also added valet which we didn't have before.  Our two room suite, full breakfast and even reception with full bar and snacks means room rates are also higher than all the limited service hotels around us.     PS  La Quinta will and has towed cars from there lot and I would hate for anyone to have to pay for the tow at ""I've been told $350"" vs. $15 each night for self park.

I was sorry to read that you didn't enjoy your stay with us and all of our complimentary offerings such as free wifi, a complimentary cooked-to-order breakfast, and complimentary evening reception.  To address to parking, it was certainly a decision the hotel did not make precipitously.  With the challenge of so many vehicles in the parking lot that did not belong to our guests, it forced hotel to hire a company to manage our parking lot.  In fact, we were the last full service hotel in Irvine, Tustin, Costa Mesa, and Santa Ana to start charging for parking.  Additionally, it was a fee we knew would not go over well with many of our guests.  Yet when pushed with the fact that there was no parking due vehicles of non hotel guests in our lot, it made us take action.  However, we do take pride in having the lowest parking rate around.  One of our biggest competitors, Marriott Irvine charges self parking at $22 per night compared to our $15 per night price.  Our goal was to just cover the costs to manage the parking lot.  However, as a perk, it did allow us to provide valet parking to our guests which we did not have before.

I am sorry to hear about your dissatisfaction with our parking offering.  Over the last several years, one of the biggest complaints that the hotel received was on it open parking arrangement.  With several other hotels on the block and close proximity to the airport, our hotel was frequently the host of several vehicles that were not guest of the hotel.  This not only left the hotel short of spaces, but created horrible problems for registered hotel guests looking for spaces when they returned in the evening.  This brought the hotel to a crossroads where it needed to choose between the registered guests and bringing in a parking management company or leaving an open unmanaged parking lot that was not meeting the needs of the guests.  Since the arrival of the marking management company, the hotel has not run out of parking spaces, has added valet parking, and even offers valet parking at the self parking price should the self parking area be full.

Please accept my apologies on behalf of the hotel that your room was more humid than you would have preferred.  Having staying in the hotel many times before, I can certainly understand what a guest experiences and the challenges that it presents for our guests.  The hotel has a 2 pipe system, which was state of the art when the hotel opened up in 1984.  However, in 2015, it leave some definite challenges to all parties concerned.  With the concrete construction of all of our guest room walls, it has prevented the hotel from upgrading the system to current 4 and 6 pipe systems which allow a guest to dial in a tempter more to their liking.  In 2016, one of the top priorities of the hotel’s capital plan is to find better solutions to our guests HVAC requirements.    Thank you again for sharing your thoughts on your stay.

I was saddened to hear about the various issues you had in your guest room.  Please accept my apologies on behalf of the hotel for your less than stellar guest room experience.  There is certainly no excuse for our inability to property inspect and maintain your room.  I feel that a clean room in good condition is at the very basic level of service that we provide to our guests.  We have an excellent director of housekeeping and chief engineer which makes your experience even more frustrating to me. Additionally, neither of them have been able to provide me with a reasonable explanation as to why we failed to live up to our own high standards.

I would say that the three star rating given to this hotel is correct, but by the skin of their teeth. The building is very old and is in real need of a good refurbishment. A big thing for me was not being able to control the temperature in my room. The HVAC system is so old the entire building can only run ac or heat at one time. So if the temp is above 70 they turn on the ac, if below 55 the heat. If the temp is between 55-70 no heat or ac is running. If you have been to southern Californian you know, especially at night the temp is often between 55-70 meaning no ac or heat for a lot of the time.

Please rest assured that he will be investigating your report and making sure that similar occurrences do not happen for future guests of the hotel.  Cleaner – There is certainly no excuse for our team to have accidently left behind a bottle of Spic n’ Span in your guest bathroom.  Please accept my apology on behalf of the hotel for this error.  Elevators – The hotel over the past year has been in the process of modernizing the hotel’s elevator system.  Currently, 3 of the 5 elevators have been completed and the remaining 2 elevators will go down for rehab at the end of March, for 10 weeks.  We are very excited for the new digital components and upgraded technology!  Pool Temperature - The hotel is required by the health code to maintain a pool temperature of 82*F.  This on occasion can feel warmer or cooler than normal depending on our weather patterns.  Per say the region had been experiencing cold weather and had heat wave, the pool could be perceived as cold since the heat wave is so dramatic.  3 times per day, our engineering team checks the pools temperature and chemical balance to ensure optimum swimming conditions and safety for all of our guests.   Thank you so much for your positive comments about our staff!  We believe the a clean and friendly hotel is fundamental to any establishment and it is our goal to continuously provide ""10"" level service to our guests.  I'm so glad that we were able to hit the mark for you!  Each day our staff strives to make our hotel a better place than it was the day before.  We look forward to you seeing our continuous improvement to an already fantastic hotel, on your next stay to the Orange County area!  Warmest Regards, Timothy R.

The public areas of the hotel are very dated. 1970's, early 80's look and not in a charming way.  The room I stayed in looked like it was decorated with a little bit of everything they could find - at a garage sale. Just a mish mosh of textures, colors and fabrics. The decorator tried, but the rooms are just way too busy. No closet, just an armoire with the ironing board leaned up against the inside of it.

A bit old and dated but OK for a couple of nights.  The issue is that in their wisdom the hotel decided that they did not need to heat the building which includes all the rooms even if it is December and the outside temperature is in the low 40's.  I woke up at 3:00AM freezing. I called the front desk and learned that there was no heat in the whole building since when the engineer left earlier in the day it was warmer than 55 degrees... The front desk can't get the heating going without the engineer...  Stupid answer. As if the engineer could not check the weather forecast and know that the night was going to be extremely cold!

As a frequent traveler, we certainly appreciate your understanding that the property staff was just as affected and shocked as the guests were when this tragic event occurred in the atrium of the hotel. Quick action by the management and on-duty late evening staff redirected guests away from the scene as soon as possible and assisted with luggage while police and authorities managed the situation, which was otherwise outside of our control at the time. Hotel management was in close contact with the local authorities in securing the scene and trying to mitigate guest exposure and inconvenience which is difficult with an open atrium design – while at the same time doing our utmost to respect the deceased and wishes of the investigators at the scene.”    Regarding your difficulties with access to the elevators, bell carts and bellmen during the heavy Trade Show checkout, we apologize for the wait you experienced. It is certainly our wish that even with 300 rooms of Trade Show attendees, all with numerous boxes and trade show displays exiting around the same time that we would have the staff and resources available to assist every guest in a timely manner.   We normally have 5 elevators that service the property’s needs but two of these were out of service as part of a modernization upgrade and are scheduled to be back in service, working better than ever, by mid February. As you may have noticed during your stay, the elevator upgrade is a part of the hotel’s multi-million dollar interior and exterior renovation which is taking place and will include new carpet in all of the guestrooms, corridors and meeting rooms as well as many other improvements like the already renovated lobby, restaurant, sports bar and parking lot.
