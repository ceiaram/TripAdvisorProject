Sorry, but you guys totally let this place down.   Check-in was good, the restaurant was good, Parkestry roof top bar is great, and the rooms are lovely but if you're bringing a car and you want to valet park be prepared to take a few deep breaths.  You pay a lot to park here and for what? A valet to watch you literally dragging your bag from the car while three (yes three) of them standby and watch having a chit chat?

8 helpful votes,23 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice visit before the rush,"We decided to come down from nor cal for a quick trip.  The staff was exceptionally polite (from concierge, check in, to the bartender).  During covid-19 the gym is still closed but they have two peloton bikes that are by the pool.  Pool is still open (as of today but who knows with the lockdowns).  The rooms are really clean and modern.  We thought we‚Äôd stay at the new gem of Anaheim before this place got really busy.  They‚Äôre only at 7% capacity right now so it‚Äôs really quiet and quite peaceful.  Definitely a nice getaway and good prices.  This hotel is going to take off, especially when dland reopens.  We brought our dog and there‚Äôs plenty of walking areas to walk them and let them do their business.  It‚Äôs also right next to the Anaheim garden walk.",November 2020,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,138,49

Couldn't have picked a better place to do it! Service was top notch. The Hotel decor is beautiful. While a lot of things in the area are shut down, there really wasn't a need to even leave the property with everything they had open. We enjoyed the sunset at Parkestry with some friends who also loved it. The charcuterie board was SO good along with the cocktails. Coming from working in a luxury hotel, I tend to be on the pickier side when I visit other hotels but they definitely passed the test. Being a new hotel, that is not easy.

With limited food and beverage services--if they are even offered in-house--it is hard to do a complete evaluation. However, with these limitations, I did enjoy my visit. Beautiful property, as would be expected for a new JWM property.   Valet parking at $40 a night is the only parking options. I did not notice any special Covid-19 precautions being taken here, other than the mandatory mask wearing. Parking has always been a hot button with me and I think the $40 charge is a bit high. I also found the car retrieval time a bit longer than it should have been.  The hotel does have food and beverage outlets open but purchased items need to be consumed outdoors or in your room. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken",September 2020,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,140,49

Instead it opened at the end of August. We spend the Labor Day weekend there and it was a very pleasant experience. We got a beautiful suite upgrade at JW Marriott Anaheim. It was brand new and we were the first people to stay in this suite. Two full bathrooms, amazing kitchen, dining room and a huge seating area. The bedroom was very cozy. Everything was perfect. Views of the Disneyland from the jacuzzi tub are amazing. The only thing missing were the fireworks! The GM is an amazing connoisseur of true hospitality.

This hotel is situated with a commanding view of the Disney Resort and it will be spectacular when the lights go back on and the fireworks return !  We were very impressed with all of the staff we interacted with.  From the excellent front desk staff, the valets, to the Food & Beverage staff - all were well trained, experienced and professional. We had a minor problem and some requests, that were all solved immediately.   The handcrafted cocktails were delicious and included herbs from their lovely garden. We also had a delicious burger and fries and a Margarita pizza.  The hotel and grounds are pretty, modern, and clean.  Lots of safety guidelines in place, ppe, sanitation and cleanliness.

Customer service was great and friendly especially the valet attendant Megan!! I had forgotten a bag and my wallet in the car after they had already parked it. I was nervous about my wallet being left out in the open so I had to ask if they could get it for me. I expected some attitude when asking since they had just parked my car but instantly Megan was so friendly about it and with no hesitation helped me in a hurry to make sure I got my wallet which I really appreciated.

71 helpful votes,56 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Refreshing new hotel near Disneyland.,"This resort had only been open 6 days when we checked in for a 5 day stay, so facility is in pristine shape.  Numerous restrictions due to COVID that when lifted will enhance a stay. It is a bit odd to be in this normally high volume traffic area and have it virtually shut down. Something has to change soon in California as it looks like an apocalypse. Ate at several restaurants in the area where they are only allowed to serve food outside. They are making a valiant effort to serve at reduced tables space but I don‚Äôt see how they can manage the overhead. The State of California better get its act together or the return of tourism will be too slow to recover.
