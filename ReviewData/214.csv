It was especially easy to get to the Newport area. Compared to many other properties this hotel includes free parking which also helps the budget. The property is in great shape with a very nice lobby and grounds. We had a good-sized room with two queens and slept very well.

I can say this because I requested a room change due to excessive noise coming from the floor above me - I believe it was from other guests but can't confirm.

I contacted the Front Office Manager by e-mail a few days prior to our visit to request a quiet room on the top floor and let him know we were visiting for my wife's birthday. He responded quickly and indicated he would set it up if we let him know what time we were arriving. He picked out the perfect room away from the freeway and any potential noise - it was very quiet. My wife was very pleasantly surprised when we entered the room to find complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.  This is a great hotel.

The staff is unbelievably warm, inviting, polite, nice and easy going. They all do an outstanding job. Doesn't matter if you have the lowest priced room or the most expensive priced room, they treat all of their guests  as if they are royalty.

The hotel does have a breakfast bar and menu you can order from, but it is expensive. For 2 adults, the buffet was $25.81. If you plan to eat at the hotel I recommend getting the breakfast vouchers when you reserve your room; it was only an extra $15/night and it is good for 2 people....actually, it gets you a $25.00 voucher and then you pay anything that is over $25.00.

As always, the breakfast staff did lighten up my day, they were so  friendly! Another plus for you jet-lagged travellers from Europe who wake up early in the morning: the pool hours are from 6.00 am till late (about 10 pm, I think), so you can have a good swim before breakfast! If I had to find a minus, it would be the slow computer in the lobby, but it was free, we were on holiday and just to",May 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,508,214

The staff was fantastic every time, especially the waitstaff in the bar / restaurant. Free happy hour with free food and drinks daily is great. Desk staff was always very friendly and helpful. Location was great and close to everything. Free parking and free internet is a huge plus, especially given that this hotel is the best rate in the area by a long shot.

37 helpful votes,25 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great for women travelers,"Once again, all of the wonderful people who write on TripAdvisor did not steer me wrong.  I had business in Costa Mesa and this hotel was far cheaper than the others I looked at, had free Internet and free parking, which the other hotels didn't.  It was two miles away instead of 1/2 a mile, but I had a car, so no problem.  I was a little nervous, but the hotel was beautiful.  My room looked brand new, had a useful desk, a mini fridge and a microwave.  Room service was well priced, good food, and efficient.  Best of all, when the room service guy came, he announced himself, asked whether it was okay for him to come in, and propped the door open so he was never in my room with the door closed.

My first impression was that this hotel looks much more impressive than other Holiday Inns I've seen.  The check-in staff were extremely nice.  We were too tired to search Orange County for a restaurant, so we ate at the Holiday Inn.  The staff was friendly and helpful, very attentive.  The food was good (and the offerings were quite varied, beyond the usual steak and hamburgers).  The room was clean and spacious.  We appreciate the microwave and fridge, the free wi-fi internet, the now-ubiquitous curved shower rods and built-in hair dryers.  The shower spray was high enough for tall men, but the water pressure had plenty of ""oomph"" for us petite ladies.

This is a very urban setting and not particularly scenic. The check in staff was friendly and explained the different features of the property to me on check in. The lobby looked nicer than some of the other Holiday Inns that I have been too. My room was clean and comfortable. Looked like it had been through a remodel. Comfy bed and bedding. Granite in the bathroom and toiletries probivided. There I did not have the free breakfast, but I did order room service from their paninin cafe. It was nice to see a room service menu with reasonable prices. Salad, panini sandwich and fries for around $10.

6 helpful votes,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice...but problematic,"We spent a week here on vacation the first week of April. When we checked in, our room wasn't ready and we had to wait until 6pm to check in even though its supposed to be 4pm. We got a non-smoking room even when we requested smoking. The first few nights were fine. Then they got a cheerleading convention in town and all hours of the night there was screaming in the hallways and doors opening and closing. The walls are thin and you could hear it all. After calling the front desk numerous times, we ended up with very little sleep. The breakfast was wonderful. The housekeeper always moved our stuff around the room...and we did not like that. The pool was nice. Overall, it was ok..but not likely that we would stay here again.

The hotel staff were friendly, quick and eager to please and that included everyone from the receptionist to the porter to the bar staff to the breakfast waiters. Only had breakfast in the hotel and it consisted of a plentiful warm buffet.  Overall excellent value, clean and highly recommended. Well worth a visit.

Crowds at D-land were terrible, but this Holiday Inn provided a nice overnight refuge from the maddening crowd at a great price.  With our Entertainment Card received a $63 per night rate that included a full hot breakfast.  Room was spacious and clean & included a refrigerator & microwave.  Only negatives were two burnt out light bulbs in the room & the king size bed mattress was a little old & saggy.  However, we slept well due to wearing ourselves out at Disneyland.

The check in desk is very efficient.  Waits are minimal most of the time.  Check out (at least if you're Priority Club, which is free to join) is even more efficient, since they leave you your statement under your door overnight and you thus only need to drop your key as you leave.  The rooms and facilities are clean and nice (when they aren't refurbishing, which they have been on several occasions in the past year).  Problems are resolved in reasonable time.
