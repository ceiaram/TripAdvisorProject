The design team have created a wonderfully modern spin on the old Spanish stylings of the nearby Mission. Kudos to them. We also received friendly service from all staff members we encountered.  This hotel is odd in that it looks and feels like a posh resort, but its location next to a noisy I-5 exit, with uninspired views of either an elementary school or a busy thoroughfare, simply doesn't suit its grandiosity. And considering how new the hotel is, the rooms are smaller than expected (although they are cozy and classy).

It’s truly a beautiful boutique hotel/small resort in the heart of one of So Cal’s most iconic towns, San Juan Capistrano! Every aspect of this property shows great attention to detail and captures the heart of SJC in the treasured California Mission heritage and style. The rooms are beautiful, as are the public spaces and as if that weren’t enough, the food at Ysidora Restaurant and Lounge is spectacular, creative Spanish/Mexican fare, prepared by chef Obregon! He’s sooooo talented. Lastly, the staff is warm and welcoming at every turn. We can’t wait to go back again!",September 2020,none,none,"Thank you for your terrific feedback and rating!

Staffing is good,  great attitude and willing to help.  However,  they haven’t worked out all the details.  Decor,  workmanship design is beautiful- Spanish Hacienda Style Architecture, matching the town.  Got to the room expecting a king size bed per my reservation but was given a double queen.  When ask to switched- all Kings were gone.  Called Marriott Directly who screwed up my reservation, Still waiting for their reply. Then welcoming message on the TV monitor was to the wrong person.  When my wife went into the bathroom to take a shower,  there was a line of ants going from the sink to the ceiling.  Never had ants in any Marriotts I stayed at.  The housekeeping came to address the ant issue with an ant",September 2020,none,none,"Thank you for your business and candor.

The check in experience was flawless beginning with Jake and Max on the valet team who greeted us with attentiveness and positivity, and then getting checked in by the front office manager Quinn was a nice perk as she was extremely helpful in ensuring my connecting room request.    I highly recommend the restaurant Ysidora as well! Christine was able to get us a reservation last minute for my friends and I, and Molly our server was amazing! Very personable and kind. Highly recommend the frozen paloma on the drink menu and the sliders are to die for! The GM Pam even personally greeted us at our table which made us feel very special.   Lastly check out was smooth and hospitable with Antonia and Eric. They made sure my bill",September 2020,none,none,"Thanks Michael!  We appreciate your great comments and a staff recognition.

The property is beautiful with lush landscaping and interesting architectural details around every corner. Our room was very comfortable and the bed was heavenly. The bathroom had a standing shower with a rain shower head and shower wand. The pool was refreshing and very clean. I appreciate that the hotel and staff have a lot of signage and precautions to keep us safe during these COVID times.  I highly recommend the weekend brunch at the hotel restaurant, Yisadora. We had the Chicken Chilaquiles and the Sweet Corn Pancakes and both were divine!  There is plenty to do and lots of restaurants within walking distance.

First off we got a reservation for 1 night for the premiere night (first night ever open) at this incredibly beautiful hotel. I advised the hotel that we were celebrating my girlfriends birthday prior to arriving and boy did the staff make her day extra special. She received a beautiful arrangement of flowers as a special gift to her.  We love downtown San Juan Capistrano for the lively restaurants and bar scene as there are so many great places to visit. Downtown San Juan Capistrano sorely needed a great hotel to accomodate the ever increasing number of tourists.  It all started at the valet (side note: Expedia said there was free self-parking but they only offer valet parking for $42/night with unlimited in/outs). I was asked my name and I provided it and,September 2020,none,none,"Thank you for your terrific feedback!
