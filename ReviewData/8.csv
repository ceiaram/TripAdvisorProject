There was also a time where i needed to use VIP so they can find a parking for me because i couldnt get parking at all. Maybe because they let anyone park there as long as they pay a fee instead of only guests. VIP was free due to lack of parking. Other than that its a good hotel.

It fell short of all expectations though and the longer we stayed the more issues we discovered.  We decided to splurge and get the kids suite since we would be staying 4 nights (last minute we booked an extra night to make it 5).  We booked through Orbitz.  Got to the room and check in was easy.  The girls were friendly-ish, so no complaints there.  The room is ok.  It’s nice in terms of tons of space, but definitely needed better cleaning.  Our sink didn’t drain nor did the hot water in the sink ever work until the last two nights.  We found spiders in the bathtub (as well as some mold and just caked on dirt).

No way can you charge 4 devices after a day at the resorts.  There are other hotels in the area that are comparable and with more bang for the buck.

They never replaced the ice bucket liner or cleaned bathroom floors or even replaced soap. The rooms were older and our particular rooms smelled extremely musty.

You touched on some areas that I would like to address just in case others are interested.  Typical with hotels these days is the practice of changing sheets every other day unless needed or requested by the guest to help reduce the amount of chemicals released into the environment during the laundering process.  But again, if a guest requests them to be changed every day, we always observe the guests preference.  Breakfast is one of our most popular free amenities so that being said it does get busy.  But it is a great cost saver for families traveling on a budget.  Shuttle service to and from the Disneyland Resort is provided to guests of all Anaheim Resort Hotels (including the Cortona Inn & Suites) by the ART (Anaheim Resort Transit) shuttle service.  There is a very modest daily fee for adults and children, but the service is excellent and takes guests not only to the Disneyland Resort but to Knott’s Berry Farm, The Westfield Santa Ana Main Place Mall, The Shops at Garden Walk, Target and many other fine locations.  It even serves the Anaheim Amtrak Station for guests arriving by train.  I would also like to thank you for recognizing our Front Desk Staff.  Their primary purpose is to ensure that every guest is attended to professionally and with the utmost of care and to ensure that their stay is comfortable and relaxing.  And finally, the new hotel being built in front of our hotel has reached a phase that will see less and less noise intrusion as the earth moving and underground parking garage comes to completion.  The construction process of course is only temporary with this new hotel opening in June of 2014.  In the meantime, efforts are employed to maintain noise at a minimum during the day with work only performed while most guests are away from the hotel.

The rooms were nice and seemed like they were renovated recently.  We stayed in the family suite that had two bedrooms.  This was nice because the second bedroom is very large and the kids loved the bunkbeds.  We also liked that we could put them to bed and not have to go to bed immediately ourselves.

We ended up only having 5 guests, but once we checked in we realized that this was not a place to accomodate a large group. Check-in was seamless and the front desk staff was beyond friendly.

Seems as though we met your expectations in most areas but with some dissatisfaction with our complimentary continental breakfast.  Just to touch on our breakfast as we do offer a more extensive breakfast than some hotels currently offer.  For example, every morning for breakfast we serve:  three cereal choices, toast, make your own waffles, donuts, Danish, muffins, orange juice, milk, coffee and tea.  In addition, we also feature a hot item that varies by day.  In addition to the above, we also serve one or two of the following each day:  scrambled eggs, French toast, biscuits & gravy, hard boiled eggs and pancakes.  These hot items are rotated on a daily basis to provide a little more variety to our breakfast.  To accommodate our guests, we serve breakfast from 6:30am to 9:30 am each morning.  A great tip to avoid the crowd would be to take advantage of our breakfast before 8am.  Or, for grab and go convenience, a cup of juice and piece of fruit, coffee and a donut, toast and milk can all be quickly served and you’re on your way.    And although the shampoo provided in our guest rooms is a Conditioning Shampoo, we thank you for your great tip to remind travelers that have specific toiletry item preferences that they are partial to to bring them with.

We understand your frustration with the airport transportation that brought you to our hotel.  There are a few choices available to those that are in need of transportation to and from the airport, but only the van style shuttles are able to enter our drive way and pull up and stop directly in front of our lobby.  Full size coaches may not always have easy access to all hotels and drivers are unable to move in reverse due to safety reasons.  For those passengers looking for a more convenient method of transportation, albeit perhaps priced slightly higher, there are two other van style companies that are highly recommended as well.  As for your room type, we do make every effort to accommodate all requests, however certain reservations that are made through agencies other than our own may only sell rooms with two queen beds and other bedding options are on request.  Most of the time we can accommodate these requests.  We offer our apologies that a King bed was not available during your stay.  Our complimentary Continental Breakfast is a great money saver as breakfast in some of the restaurants nearby can cost a family of four close to $40.00 per day.  Considering that our breakfast is free, the savings can really ad up for those that stay a couple days or more.  Our staff is on duty throughout the hours breakfast is served and while some of our breakfast choices may be depleted quicker than others, our staff does monitor and replenish food items as needed.  A quick mention to the hostess will resolve any issue with regards to any food choices being offered that day.    A previous guest who comments on Trip Advisor left a great tip for those looking for transportation to and from Disneyland.  This guest suggested the following:  ""Helpful hint: The bus route that serves the Cortona #3 has quite a few stops after the Cortona, it is faster to take the bus that picks up around the corner on Convention Way #6 to Disneyland and the Cortona bus on the way home only.""

Walking to the Disneyland Resort Parks is easy and measured in blocks and is 1-1/2 blocks  from the hotel.  It is also nice to know that the Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) bus will take you to and from the Disneyland Resort and to other dining/shopping and entertainment venues close by.  ART will also take one to and from the Anaheim Amtrak Station.  As for kids running around and noise, we like to think that our guests are considerate of others and make efforts to keep their kids excitement in check.  Noise issues are not unique to our hotel, though.  Granted we are not a library but sometimes a parental ""shhhh!"" may be needed, so to speak,  for the comfort and appreciation of other guests.  Thanks again for your comments and opinion.  We look forward to seeing you again at the Cortona Inn & Suites.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1567,8

It is always satisfying for our team to read comments such as yours as we all work very hard at making sure that our hotel can deliver clean, comfortable accommodations with value.  Each team member takes great pride in knowing that their efforts help make pleasant memories possible for our guests by ensuring that their stay is satisfactory.  With respect to the ""Kettle"", we do what we can to ensure that guests from all over the world are made to feel at home and comfortable.    I especially appreciate your comments about our FREE, yes FREE breakfast.  Although it is a complimentary deluxe ""American"" style Continental Breakfast,  there is always something for everyone.  There is a variety of breakfast favorites served each morning, as well as tea, coffee, milk, orange and apple juice.  Considering a jump across the street to a popular branded American family restaurant  will set you back and average of $30.00 for a family of four, our breakfast represents an incredible value.

Many factors can affect rate, and being sold out is one of those factors.  Your decision to not check in and seek other accommodations meant that you did incurr a late cancel/no show fee as we did in good faith hold your room for you.

The clerk that originally assisted you was hopeful that because she could not find your reservtion under the correct spelling that you iterated to her, she was asking for a confirmation number that would reval the reservation record that would  allow her view your booking and if necessary, update the last name with the correct spelling.  In this process, you quickly departed the front desk and came back a few moments later with your daughter but proceeded to our other clerk on duty who was able to locate your reservation by your first name as the first clerk had suggested to him.

I cant help but mention in my reply to you that our previous guest comment was not so positive about our bedding, and as you mention, you found our bedding to be quite comfortable.  Therein lies the dilemma for any hotelier when faced with comments about beds.  So, I should say that because you found our beds to be comfortable I will believe that this is more the norm than not.

I believe, and as you mention, it is truly a great breakfast that is free, complete and can save a family a fair amount of money on a daily basis.  We offer a great selection of items for free each morning, and what we dont offer may be found on the menu's of restaurants that charge anwhere from $4.00 to $12.00.

The results that will be returned for those two topics will help define the discussion about breakfast and what determines whether a hotel is a hotel or motel.

I'm even bordering on family dorm. the only part of the pictures in the website that was ""real"" was the check-in lobby in the middle of the hotel. The room block was old, doors were thin and everybody could look into your room if you forget to draw your curtains.

76 helpful votes,134 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,OK - without beeing impressive,"From the pictures we imagined actually a hotel - but Cortona is more like a motel. Pros is that it is near Disneyland, and that the busroute leaves near the hotel (3 mins walk). You can't walk to Disneyland, - you'll be too wornout to enjoy the park. We bought at 3 days pass at the reception. Bad things are that the doors are very thin - so you'll hear everything going on when other guests come and go. Breakfast was OK - but the room is to small for the amount of guests, so we had to wait a bit every morning to sit down to eat.",June 2010,none,none,"Dear Perkja, Thank you for your review.    Since your comment makes mention of motel versus hotel, I have referenced a definition of HOTEL that can be found online:  HOTEL - A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging, usually on a short-term basis. Hotels often provide a number of additional guest services such as a restaurant, a swimming pool or childcare. Some hotels have conference services and meeting rooms and encourage groups to hold conventions and meetings at their location.  Interestingly enough, many of todays current terms describing hotels and motels date back many years and may be of French origins.  In any event, I have seen this comment in the past and I thought I would take a new approach to help solve the question on what exactly a hotel and/or motel truly is.    So, that being said, Cortona Inn & Suites, with a 3 Diamond AAA rating, pool and meeting room, can appropriatly be referred to as a hotel, having met the criteria as defined above.  Now with respect to the walk to Disneyland, I wish I could compare it to the Walt Disney World,  Florida, where one must use buses or cars to travel great distances between hotel and the different parks and may take days to complete a thorough visit.  But I wont.  I will only say that when measured by the physical size of a city block, we are two blocks away from the Disneyland Resort parks.  Depending on how fast one walks, or how fast a family walks, it can take from 10-20 minutes but that also counts the time wating for the traffic signals to ensure safe crossing at the intersections.  Using the ART shuttle will greatly reduce the walk to the Disneyland Resort, and may take about the amount of time to arrive at the park.  Granted, for the return to the hotel late at night, and after a busy day of fun and walking, a shuttle is nice to ride even if your hotel is just across the street (for which there are but only a handful).  So, keeping the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim , California in perspective, the Cortona Inn & Suites is extremely close to the Disneyland Resort parks and just minutes away.    I dont know exactly what is meant about thin doors, as the doors used at the Cortona Inn & Suites are doors typical of any other hotel.  Metal doors are used for strength and security and durability and are insulated to reduce the pentration of noise into guest rooms.    As for our breakfast room, it is capable of accommodating about 40 people seated at one time.  The breakfast room at Cortona Inn & Suites is actually, by comparison, much larger than the rooms used by many of our competitors.  I have mentioned this before in previous comments about our breakfast room, but we serve breakfast from 630AM to 930AM each morning to allow enough time for everyone to enjoy a complimentary breakfast.  We would like to think that all guests would be considerate of others so that everyone can be accommodated in a timely manner.  Thanks again for your review and comments and trust that we will see you again soon.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1596,8
3 helpful votes,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't Let the Bed Bugs Bite,"1. Checked in. Notified that on Wednesday the power would be out for 6 hours.  No electricity whatsoever.  All the food in our fridge...no ability to go in and use the room with electricity for those hours and most importantly, NOT DISCLOSED BEFORE I BOOKED!!!!!  2. The sheets were not clean.  I am pretty sure I saw boogers on the sheets. Nasty!  3. There was a silverfish in the bed.  4. Hotel pictures did not describe the exterior well.  5. Hotel parking is limited. You cannot view the car from the room.  6. Hotel staff were not very helpful. When complained they never acknowledged it. They simply listened.  7. Breakfast: Poor quality foods. Enriched bread products only. Some people got eggs, not everyone did. They ran out quickly. All food is served on styrofoam plates. You",June 2010,none,none,"Thank you for your review.  Honestly, somewhat mispresenting our Inn and that is simply not very fair.  Your headline of Dont Let the Bed Bugs bite can be miscontrued to imply something that just is not the case here.  You mentioned you saw one Silverfish.    2.  The City of Anaheim notified us of the shut off of electricity to perfom repairs to natural gas lines.  Electricity to several hotels and other business in our sector was turne off as a prevenative measure to avoid a more serious event should an electrical spark ignite gas under pressure.  We posted signs all throughout the hotel of this six hour shut off in every public area, elevator, breakfast room as well as voice mail messages on each occupied guest room phone.  When the city imposes something of this nature on a business, it is always difficult but the work must be completed and all we ask is for understanding.  You may want to contact the City of Anaheim to express your discontent with the city and let them know of the negative effects it may have caused you.  3.  Silverfish in bed.  At least in California, at times some of natures creatures may find themselve inside our homes, cars, boats, even hotels and restaurants.  Every reputable business will employ a pest control program to elimiate or greatly reduce the incidences of unwanted pests in or around a business.  Although highly effective, it may not always be 100% in any situation.  4.  Hotel exterior pictures of the Cortona Inn & Suites are similar to pictures found of other hotels.  Unless one likes to study the paint and stucco, we tend to focus on the attributes of the hotel that guests may find pleasing...pool pictures, room pictures, breakfast, gift shop,  lobby, etc.  The focus is on interior pictures which can allow a guest to view the rooms that they would be staying in, with different pictures of the different room types.   5.  Hotel parking is limited to registered guests of the hotel only.  Because of our great proximity to the Anaheim Convention Center as you noted, we must restrict parking to guests only to ensure that each guest has parking for their vehicle.  Parking permits are issued and those vehicles not displaying proper credentials may be towed at owners expense.  This is fully disclosed to guests at time of registration.  As for the ability to view your vehicle from your guest room is unavoidable.  I am thinking about hotels such as the Anaheim Marriott, Anaheim Hilton, Clarion, Courtyard, Sheraton, Travelodge, Candy Cane Inn and countless others that having parking that may not be visible from every guest room.  My point is, is that we offer free parking...other hotels may charge for parking.  Viewing a parked vehicle from a parking garage or parking lot may not always be possible.  6.  Hotel staff not very helpful... Could be a matter of opinion and/or the perception based on the discussion.  Our staff is always trying to do their best to ensure that each guest is comfortable and has an enjoyable stay.  There may be challenges to a clerk that are presented once in a while, but part of good training is that the clerk listen to the guest so that they can then take the appropriate measures to rectify whatever the situation.  Breakfast.  The food served is restaurant quality purchased from the nations largest purveyor food products for restaurants, insitutions and other uses.  Breakfast hours are from 630am to 930am.  The breakfast room also serves as a meeting room available from 12noon.  In order to ensure that the meeting room is ready for occupancy, the breakfast service is discontinued timely each morning at 930am.  Although guests may continue to remain and enjoy their breakfast, food items are removed from the serving area as part of the cleaning process.    Hotel is not worth normal price of $229...our prices are monitored regularly to ensure that we offer the most competative pricing in our area.  Not sure if that is actually the price you paid, and if you did it would be for a suite.  Keep in mind that we do not charge for parking, breakfast, internet or local phone calls.  9.  Hotels.com rewards.  I cant comment on this because it has nothiing to do with the Cortona Inn or the decisions made to secure your accommodations.  10.  Wasted time for ARTS... if you were not satisfied with the ARTS service I would suggest you direct your comments to them as they provide shuttle service for most hotels in the Anaheim Resort.  Room smelled...not sure what you are referring to unless it is the newness of the fabrics that were part of our most recent room renovation.    12  Breakfast stinks...keep in mind it is a Continental Breakfast that we serve that we have kicked up a few notches...and it is complimentary.  Hard boiled eggs are served some days while scrambled eggs are served other days.  We vary the menu to keep it different and still provide food items that are satisfying.  On a personal note, never select a hotel because they serve hard boiled eggs.

If at 930 am you should arrive and find less than the items listed above, it is because the service has ended and the cleanup process has begun.

Biscuits and gravy seem to be quite popular with the majority of our guests so if you would like to clarify your thoughts with us that would be appreciated. The Cortona Inn & Suites takes pride in serving a deluxe Continental Breakfast that is complimentary each morning from 630am to 930am.  Our breakfast room has a capacity of 55 seated guests at one time.  Just as with many popular restaurants, we are not immune to crowds and do our best to accmmodate everyone.  A great tip is that the early hours are not as busy as the later hours.  We currently serve:  Biscuits and Gravy, Scrambled Eggs, Make your own waffels, Donuts, Toast, cold cereal choices, oatmeal, danish, fresh fruit, milk, orange juice, apple juice, coffee and tea.  For those that prefer a tradtional breakst, we are happy to offer suggestions for restaurants in the area offering breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Also the walls are thin and we also listened to the people above us running around also. There is nothing the hotel can really do about this but just be aware. Recommendation - stay on the top floor.

Your comments are unique in the sense that we did try to accommodate your request for early check in.  It is possible that the guest that you let pass ahead of you had a different room type than yours that was ready and therefore was able to gain immediate occupancy.  If your room type was NOT available at that same instant, we would have informed you of such.  Although our check in time is 3PM, it seems as though we are being faulted for not providing your room earlier than guaranteed.  Typically, requests for early check in are based on availabilty of the room type upon your arrival, not necessarily at the time of a phone call.  In any event, we accommodate the majority of our guests with early check in as a standard procedure, knowing that it is often appreciated.  No doubt, your circumstances were out of the ordinary even though our clerks did try to find you an available room.  As for the phone call you received at night, there was a rash of prank callers that were calling different hotels suggesting many things to guests.  I honestly dont believe that any of our staff would be calling a guest room at the time of day you indicated suggesting the nees to change rooms or even use the term downgrade.

When checking in to a hotel, even for cash paying customers, it is quite commen that a credit is also requested to cover any additional charges that may be incurred during the course of ones stay.  Although room charges may be paid in advance in cash upon arrival, additional charges are billed to your room account and settled at the time of check out using whatever payment method you choose, whether cash or credit card.  As I stated above, this is common in our industry.  Second, if the gentleman that came in to the lobby asked for a key to your room and was not recognized by the clerk on duty and was not able to verify his identity, the clerk is trained to refuse the guest access to the room.  Please understand that this is for your protection.  No hotel can issue a key to a guest that is not identified as being the occupant of the room nor to one who is unable to verify his/her identity.  Clerks are trained in guest safety and security and there are many tactics that must be employed to ensure that only guests that should have access to a guest room are in fact a registered guest in that room.  BUT, I can guarantee you that at NO time would our clerks have suspected that you or anyone else in your party as being criminal like for waiting outside our lobby or sitting in our lobby nor do we think of any guest as being a common criminal.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1644,8

I will also remind our housekeepers that they should slow down some with their carts in the earlier hours of the morning so that it doesnt cause the noise you may have heard.  As for TV buttons being broken, it may have been done intentionally as a deterrent to prevent settings being changed that should not be attempted by anyone other than our maintenance staff.  It has to do with the premium pay system.  In fact, the buttons may appear broken but it is for a reason.  All TV settings are made with remote controls.  In any event, I want you to know that I have looked into your concerns and have found that most can be easily resolved.  So, once again, thanks for your review and perhaps the next time you visit Anaheim, we can change your mind about where to stay and allow us another opportunity of meeting your expectations.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1654,8

So, being an avid Food Network viewer, I turned to them for the definition of Continental Breakfast.  Here it is:   CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST   Definition: A light breakfast that usually consists of a breadstuff (such as toast, croissants, pastries, etc.) and coffee, tea or other liquid. The continental breakfast is the antithesis of the hearty english breakfast.   What we offer consists of the following:  - Choice of 3 cold cereals (Kellogs, for those that are brand concious) - Oatmeal - Assorted Danish - Donuts - Toast (White and Wheat bread) - Waffles - Hard Boiled Eggs (Health Department requires they be refrigerated...can be heated gently in microwave oven) - Fresh Fruit (Apples, Oranges) - Milk (2% low fat) - Coffee - Decaf and regular - Two Fruit Juices (Orange and Apple) - Tea  Compared to the definition of Continental Breakfast, we do exceed the basics and still plan to add more.  We are in the process of adding more hot items as well as freshly made waffles.  Usually, a Continental Breakfast is a ""grab and go"" thing...a quick bite in morning to get you started.    Not sure about the diabetes issue, but I did find what a diabetic can have for breakfast:   1 slice of whole wheat bread which you toast to your own particular liking. Then on to this spread 1 teaspoon of margarine. Then on to the toast you can either place 1/4 cup of egg substitute or cottage cheese. However if you want something a little more warm and substantial in the morning replace the cottage cheese/egg substitute with 1/2 cup of oatmeal mixed with 1/2 cup of skimmed milk. Plus you are also allowed 1/2 of a small banana.  For most guests, our Continental Breakfast offers not only great value, but also a great selection of most breakfast favorites.

I am happy to hear that we met some of our goals by providing you and your family with the value that you were expecting with respect to your hotel accommodations.  Quite frankly, it is difficult to find a happy medium with beds since what may be soft to one could be firm to another and vice versa.  Our beds are relatively new and while they did not provide the comfort your were expecting, it is not due to the condition of the bedding.  There are many manufactures of hotel beds as well as many different designs and levels of comfort.  Our beds are designed to provide a broad degree of comfort rather than discomfort.  Regardless, they did not appeal to your or your family and we appreciate your input.  Although we do not have a restaurant on premise, there are many restaurants within a very short walking distance in either direction.  Personally, I enjoy the Agio Risotrante for some of the best freshly prepared food in Anaheim.  For late night snack urges or hunger pains, we do have vending machines with a fresh supply of snacks, chocolates, etc as well as a beverage machine with soda, water and juice.  Several restaurants even deliver.  I admit, I love to walk but I know that after a busy day to the park, it might seem a bit far with kids in tow.  That is the beauty of the ARTS (Anaheim Resort Transit Service) bus that provides shuttle service between most hotels in the Anaheim Resort (including Cortona Inn) and the Disneyland Resort, as well as other shopping and entertainment venues in the Resort.  It even stops at the Anaheim Amtrak and Metrolink Train Station.  To help with your last comment, the new Anaheim Garden Walk will open June 14th where you will find many nice restaurants as well as some establishments that will serve adult beverages and is located just south of the hotel at Harbor Blvd and Clementine St.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1677,8

With respect to your comments about our Continental Breakfast, is it the appearance or the product?

Our service is from 6:30 to 9:30 every morning.  If you are referring to the room where the breakfast is served, please be more specific so that we can consider any suggestions you may have.  Our business center is a fully self contained set-up which allows one to perform most tasks that one would care to do while vacationing.  One is able to check email, make online purchases, shop, print boarding passes, print documents, online banking, etc.  The service is fee based, and is very reasonable and inline with many internet services that are offered for a fee.  In addition to our fee based in room high speed internet access, we do offer a complimentary wireless high speed internet access service in our public spaces such as lobby, breakfast room, pool area.  For those without a laptop computer, the business center is a very handy option.  Some hotels combine fees in the rate and are not listed as a line item.  We have elected to list the fee separately so that one can distinguish the rate by itself.  This helps to find the best rate when shopping for the best rate.  Keep in mind that we do not charge for parking, local phone calls, toll free access, in room coffee, free wireless in lobby or continental breakfast.
