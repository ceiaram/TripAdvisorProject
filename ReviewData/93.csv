Unfortunately, a slow but marked decrease in quality over time is now evident.  While the location is still as stunning as always, and the villas are spacious, the quality of service has been on a downward slope, and a seeming lack of attention to customer expectations more evident.  It starts with the check in process-- where late in the day villas are not ready for check in, and waiting customers are kept hostage to misleading ETA's; even delayed airlines are getting better at being honest with passengers when delayed flights will actually take off.

For example, in-room coffee service is with an automatic grind-your-own coffee maker.  Coffee beans are provided (instead of the institutional packets) which can be placed in the coffee maker, which then grinds then brews fresh drip grind coffee.

Our aim is to deliver the perfect guest experience, where every aspect, step and moment of a guest’s stay is comfortable, satisfying and uplifting. To this end, we provide complimentary valet parking and Internet access, as well as access to all pools, fitness centers and spa facilities without an added resort fee. Many guests have expressed appreciation for these value-driven considerations, which are uncommon among other luxury destinations.  Regarding the Resort’s architectural design, it was envisioned through decades of careful planning and a clear, long-term vision. As an authentic, yet modern, adaptation of Italian Renaissance architecture, the Resort’s design was intended to be aesthetically pleasing, timeless, and perfectly suited to its chic California coastal setting. Pelican Hill is a truly inspired adaptation of the architectural style of Italy’s renowned 16th century architect Andrea Palladio, whose work was based on the classic building principles of ancient Rome and Greece. Palladio’s legacy has been adapted to the 21st century to create a resort of timeless beauty, proportion and vision.  The unprecedented attention to detail has set Pelican Hill apart as one of the world’s finest Resorts. In fact, Pelican Hill has been recognized with top national and global accolades from Andrew Harper Hideaway Report, Condé Nast Traveler, Travel & Leisure and many others since opening in 2008. The Resort’s architecture was also featured in a cover story of Architectural Digest magazine.  Once again, thank you for taking the time to post your feedback here.

As we discussed over the phone on the evening of July 31, the safety and security of all Pelican Hill guests and staff is one of our highest priorities.  During your stay, we informed you that Pelican Hill is a weapon-free Resort and all guests are required to keep personal firearms either locked in a safe or locked within your vehicle. For this reason, the unsecured rifle observed in your trunk was brought to the attention of our security team. It is not our policy to search any guest’s vehicle under any circumstances. When Resort security inquired with you directly about the weapon, you provided the serial number for it. As a matter of protocol to ensure the safety of everyone on property, the Resort provided the serial number to local law enforcement for the purposes of records verification. This step in our protocol concluded the Resort’s investigation of your rifle.  However, the local police decided come on property to investigate, including a search of your vehicle when you gave them the keys. The police then verified the matching registration for your rifle.  Although the head of Resort security offered to speak with you further to clarify any questions, concerns or confusion, you declined this follow-up with Resort management.  In consideration of the inconvenience that these security measures caused, Resort management provided you with a complimentary dinner at Andrea.

As expressed in the February 1, 2011 letter of response I sent to your family, I deeply regret the unfortunate challenges that you incurred during your recent stay at Pelican Hill. We take special dietary requirements very seriously and apologize that such attention fell short when it came to your dining experience with us. Please know that what you experienced was an exception and not the rule.   I understand your level of disappointment from the points you mentioned regarding cross-contamination and proper knowledge when handling food, and can assure you that many members of our kitchen staff are ServSafe-certified.  While I was pleased to learn that our Director of Food & Beverage and Restaurant Manager did not charge you for the meal, I would also like to make you aware of the resort-wide alert sent out on January 28, to ensure that appropriate attention was given to your gluten-free dietary requirement. In your family’s email and phone exchanges with our Restaurant Manager and Chef on January 28, our management team also offered you their personal assistance with any dining needs during your stay.  In addition to the measures taken during your stay, I have recently taken the time to meet with the Executive Chef concerning your experience and the Resort staff’s responsibility to ensure that proper care and attention are given to future guests in a similar situation as yours.

The villas, clubhouse and grounds are impeccable as are the staff, always available but never intrusive.  I encountered nothing ""cheap"" here!!  Everything is ""top notch"" at Pelican Hill.  One unusual but nice feature is that the villas each have a private garage.  The security is great.  We had friends over for dinner who joked how it was like dealing with the CIA and FBI if your not a resort guest and trying to get in!  Security calls you, then escorts visitors to your villa.  We had dinner served en suite so everyone could relax and visit.  This",March 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1904,93

They wont take you seriously unless you are willing To spend at least 25 K on your even. If you cant, or want something small, they will have the nerve to tell you that you will have to WAIT it out to book anything till “ they see if another party books that will spend MORE money” in that case, they will then Bump you!  (we offered up to $9,000) NOT exactly chicken feed!      We could not belive the stuck up attitude of the people here. No wonder it’s a ghost town, the only people there are the bored looking staff.        The place is really nice but the people who work the catering dept have got a lot to learn",January 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1905,93

From the moment we arrived, through the impressive massive arches, we were swept away into a world of beauty and luxury.  They pipe aromatherapy through the A/C throughout the property so all of your senses are engaged.  They spared no expense in every detail of the property - frunishings, finishes, amenities are all unequaled.  Our suite was FANTASTIC.  Nice patio with view, huge bathroom and bedroom, generous living room and bar, top of the line entertainment systems, 2 fireplaces, superfine linens and pillows.  And, strong wireless signal that they didn't charge $9.95 a day for (I find that so chintzy).  Whitney",February 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1906,93

I travel a fair amount around the world reserving my hotels through the reservation system of the Leading Hotels of the World, of which The Pelican Hill Resort is one of their newest members.   Pelican Hill opened only 10 weeks before my four day visit in January, the very few glitches that I saw is a compliment in itself on how good this hotel/resort is run, managed and designed.  I am privileged to have been invited a few years ago to be one of The Leading Hotels of the World, ""Unlimited"" Leaders Club members (their top tier loyalty program) which affords me many benefits, but I have to say that even without that distinction, this hotel",January 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1908,93

I made reservations in advance, but it appeared that we didn't need to.  When I made reservations they hadn't worked out all the pricing yet.  This was just their 2nd weekend to have afternoon tea.  It is served from 3pm to 5pm.  They had three prices, $19, $20, and $29.  The $19 dollar included only the baked goods, the $20 had sandwiches, and the $29, had both baked goods and sandwiches (hopefully I remembered this correctly).  All three included a selection of teas.  They had 4 on the menu, but they gave us 10 to choose from.  We all chose the $29 tea.  The sandwiches were great, there was a cucumber, egg salad, proscuitto and salmon with caviar.  Next came the",December 2008,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1909,93

This place was a 2300 squ ft House with large bedrooms bathrooms, a living room, dining room, and full sized kitchen.  There were large LCD TV's in every room. State of the art furniture, electronics, there was even a wine fridge.  And you have a butler to get you anything you need. They even delivered our mountain bikes to our garage when we asked where we could rent them. The bike ride to Crystal Cove is a must.  And when it got too dark and too tired to go back up the hill, we asked the butler to pick us up.  Steven at the Villa Club makes you drinks from the freshest ingredients and fruits.
