No one in the hotel informed us not to park on Wednesday morning and we did not see the sign that was in the far end of the street. The hotel promised one parking per room and the hotel lot was full.

With all the positive ratings this hotel has received, I know this sounds crazy, but hear me out, because I went there because of the positive reviews.  As a result, it's the number 1 rated hotel in NPB on Trip Advisors.  It is really the number 1 rated hotel in Newport Beach?  Come on people.   Partial ocean views are a joke.

I'm an avid trip advisor surfer and always run my choices by the reviews on here.  I told my husband about the Bay Shores Inn and he was worried it wouldn't be as nice as the reviews posted on here.  We were completely impressed!  We arrived early and asked if there was a room ready, there wasn't but we were given a map of the area and shown some places we could eat lunch that was within walking distance (we choose Sharkees and loved the fish tacos!).  By the time we ate and took a walk on the beach our room was ready.  We had a top floor room and were able to see the beach from our room (#301), we opened the windows and enjoyed the beach breezes, during the day the traffic on our side of the building",May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,740,128

Great location - across the street from the beach and a block from Newport Pier and a lot of great little restaurants and shops.  Ralph at the Front Desk was so nice and helpful, he directed us to a lot of the sights at this beautiful place, but the most interaction we had was with Justin at the Front Desk.  Justin was like our own personal tour guide without leaving his desk. He gave us pointers on where to dine (and every place he suggested was wonderful), what to see and local entertainment.

If I had to really dig for a criticism is that the internet web site states that they have a hot tub and cocktail lounge which is not correct.  However, for such a small place a bar would be silly. Besides there are terrific bars and restaurants just blocks away.    Once settled in we did not need our rental car, just rented a couple of bikes which took us everywhere including to the ferry for a ride to balboa island.

The room was very clean with a table and chairs for four where we ate breakfast and the room had a small sofa all the things you don't usually find.  No need to bring beach gear they have it all which is really nice.  Every afternoon they have homemade cookies in the lobby.  They have a nice sunroof and just check out the view!
