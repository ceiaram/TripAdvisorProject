none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Failed to tell us they cancelled our booking!!!,"We booked our stay weeks in advance for 8/14/20 through 8/16/20.  When we arrived in CA, I called the property to get the lock box information as they stated in their booking details they would share such.  Roni advised me that there was a maintenance issue w/ the property and unsure if it is available.   I asked why we had not been notified prior as Friday morning in the summer is hardly the time to find an open reservation for a family of SEVEN!!!!  She told me to call Chase Travel Center and they could find me another reservation???  I shared it was not Chase's responsibility.   After numerous exchanges and hours later-we learned they cancelled the reservation through Chase Travel Center and told them that we requested it.  That was not the case, we actually called to extend",August 2020,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,500
