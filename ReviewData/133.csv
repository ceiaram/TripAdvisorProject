4 helpful votes,41 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great stay at great price,"The staff were all very friendly.  The rooms are not fancy, but they are newly renovated, the mattress was comfortable, and it was clean. Nice shower, and our room had a little separate area with a couch and small desk. It was perfect to put our stroller in and store some things after Disneyland for the next day.  It is about a 20 minute brisk walk to Disneyland, or if you are a slower Walker with kids then I would say 25-30 minute walk, but that’s going slow taking your time.  It was doable for sure.  Great stay at a great price. Also, breakfast was pretty good as well, eggs, sausage, bacon and waffles. They had 3 cereals, coffee, juices, bagels and toast.

After a long day at the park, return to a clean open concept room and rest on a mattress that feels like a cloud.  The room design is modern minimalism, which provides a larger open space. Plus, the room design prevents the likelihood for any accumulated dust behind bulky furniture, which is common in most hotels.   Be advised that the room did not have a closet, so if you are the type that prefers to not live directly out of your suitcase, the lack of a closet might be a hiccup.   I enjoyed my stay at Capri.

The Capri is a great cozy hotel with awesome and very friendly staff. Have stayed at a few different hotels in the area, some more expensive some less, however, the genuine kindness and hospitality from the staff, set the Capri apart from the rest! Aubrey and Carlos have both been the sweetest and most helpful hotel employees me and my family have had! They are awesome. We can be a handful (mom of a 9 and 10 yr old all with lots of questions) No matter the hour both, Aubrey and Carlos have been patient and more than happy to help meet our needs! The rooms are clean as well as pretty big with living room area apart from the bedroom. Totally worth every dollar spent. Thank you Capri!

We were a little scared after reading the reviews but when we arrived Eby greeted us at the front desk and she was very welcoming. The building is old and is in need of a remodel which Eby & Jennie informed us that they would be doing a total remodel on the entire building. We are looking forward to coming back to see how it looks when it is finished.

Not knowing what to expect or have super high expectations we arrived in our room no problems checking in...we went to the park upon returning to the room we notice things that needed updating, fixing etc. so the next morning we brought our concerns to Jennie and the staff and they listened and were very accommodating. I was excited to here all the updates and remodeling they will be doing since they just took over the property on Wednesday 2/19/20. Can’t wait!! Good luck and see you soon!

But overall it was a pleasant stay. Jenny and evelyn were super welcoming and made the check in process really easy. I'm rating it a 5 star mainly for the service we received from the front desk.

The sign on the door said the elevator wasn't working, so we had to lug our suitcases up the outdoor staircase.  The sign looked like it had been there a while -- how long was the elevator broken??  Then, we got there about 2 p.m. and inquired about going ahead and checking in.  They admitted our room was ready, but wanted $25 for ""early check in fee"".  Really?  It cost them nothing to let us check in!  We said no.  Then the tv did not work and we had to call maintenance.  For the duration of our stay, we had to turn the tv off at the unit, the remote wouldn't work.  Then, the bathroom was really gross and run down,  badly in need of remodeling.

But rooms were not in good shape: -One room had a mattress stating against a wall getting dry by a fan, and a used soap. -Second room smell bad, the window was opened and didn't close.  -Third room had dirty covers over the bed, corner covered with cobwebs and rugs in bat situation. All rooms were on a bad shape, so we tried to cancel and leave ASAP the same night as soon as we got in the rooms.  But staff claim they have this policy where if they offer you another room they wont refund the night.

24 helpful votes,14 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Hands down the most disgusting hotel I have ever stated in.,"Needed to book a room to attend the 2020 NAMM Show and this place was mid-priced at the time of booking - just under $300/night. My mistake was failing to read the reviews ahead of time.   The pictures speak for themselves. The place was infested, filthy, and in dire need of renovation or tear down. Cockroaches, filth and hair everywhere (including on towels), broken furnishings, and a leaky ceiling.   When I asked the front desk clerk (who was perfectly nice) why their ‘Market’ in the lobby was completely empty, they said that they were in the same boat and that my guess was as good as theirs.   I wish I could have booked another hotel somewhere else but literally everywhere was sold out for the show. I was and still am very sad.

Not everyone was checked in so they do have rooms available but she refused to switch me rooms. Even tho she could give this crappy room to someone else. She said they made their reservations already . Hello I did too ! Give someone else the dirty room. First come first serve.
