We stayed from the 20-21  and booked to stay again from the 29-31 of January. We were attended to by Salvador at the front desk. He is phenomenal. The villas are quite extraordinary with everything you need in the villas. Full size kitchen, fire place enough towels, and even towels for if you’re going down to sun at the sand. At the retreat our first booking was for Villa Da Vinci and after that we booked to stay at Sleepy Hallow 2 and during our visit in June we stayed again at both Sleepy Hallow and  The sunset Cove which are all being managed by one management.

Very cozy and steps away from the beach with easy access!! We stayed in villa 2 which was my favorite it has a good mix of privacy with its own balcony and amazing view! Parking was effortless and in front of our spot. but I’d have to say besides the fantastic views the best part was the SERVICE!

We initially booked a room at 14 West on PCH, but we wanted to see the rooms in person before our stay, which the hotel was more than willing to let us do. The 14 West room we saw on PCH was pretty nice. It was clean, modern, and at a great location and for a great price. We asked about the property as we were kind of confused why we needed to check in for our hotel at the Holiday Inn next door. Turns out the owner of 14 West, who happens to own pretty much the entire block adjacent to 14 West (all shops/stores/properties), had recently acquired the Holiday Inn as well. Also found out he owns some proprieties across the street including these Villas, otherwise known as the retreat.

We enjoyed the common area and grilling on our own private balcony. Slightly off the main road so most of the sound came from the ocean.

Especially since the master gate to the unit doesn’t lock  Since you have to check in at the Holiday Inn across the street it gives you a false sense of security.  We were woken up at 4am by a banging on the door on the unit below us, also owned by the property.  Repeated banging and yelling, in the form of a domestic dispute.  I called the Laguna Hospitality phone number where I was told no one is on staff and was literally asked “what do you want me to do about it?”  I was advised to call the police.

Unit 1 is not ocean facing and you can't hear the waves from it with windows open but for the price we got it was a great deal. Clean and mostly pretty comfortable.  Very close walk to the beach. We really enjoyed our stay. Was a little thrown off when we had to move our truck on the 2nd evening from the parking space right in front of our place, to across the street due to it being ""oversized"" but several other larger vehicles were allowed to remain...

It has an excellent location, as you can easily walk to the grocery store, beach, or downtown Laguna.  I have stayed at several of the Villas in the past, but my favorite is the Villa Roma!  It has a basically private balcony, beautifully decorated, windows surround the living area, and very quiet.  Villa Rustico is nice with a large bathroom and walk in shower,  but I missed looking out to the ocean and having a  fireplace.  Villa Bella Mare is also a beautiful Villa, but has a less private balcony. The laundry facilities need worked on as you share the 2 washer and dryers with the maid service.

The bedrooms were big, tastefully decorated, and most importantly - super comfortable. After being in a conference all day, this was the perfect place to return to and rejuvenate for the next day. We slept so well.   A big highlight for us was the location, which is right next to the heart of downtown Laguna.

The first night my husband had rain that came into his room. Management went above and beyond to make him comfortable. When I joined my husband five days later, management tried to find a very comfortable place for the two of us to stay. We had to move a couple of times (because of previous reservations) which just gave us a chance to experience their different properties. None of the properties you can go wrong with. We will definitely stay here again!",October 2018,none,none,Thank you Heather for your kind words.

We stayed in Villa #1 (Villa Rustico) a one bedroom, two and a half bath with a full kitchen. Very comfortable for two people. Ideally located a block from town and steps from beach access. BTW there is a Ralphs Market within walking distance. The shared oceanfront deck is the ideal place to relax and take in the views. Spectacular on a clear day. Our Villa was not oceanfront but you can still hear the waves. The staff was more than friendly and helpful. At one point we dropped a ring down the drain in the half bath, called for maintenance and someone came right over and got it. You rarely find that kind of service anywhere. Also walking distance to several great eateries (Driftwood Kitchen, The Deck to name a couple) and the",October 2018,none,none,"On behalf of all our staff, I would like to thank you for staying with us during your trip to Laguna Beach.

Between somebody’s child running back and forth and jumping up and down, and loud partying adults, it can get very very very noise. It will sound like they are either coming thru the ceiling of in your unit with you. Unit is in a great location. Parking is very challenging. Advise a compact car only.  Enjoyed the bulk of my stay here except the last two days when it got so noisy that it was uncomfortable",October 2018,none,none,"Dear Deborah, We are sorry to hear that the noise level of other guest bothered you during your stay.

55 helpful votes,57 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Perfect Location in Beautiful Laguna Beach!,"I have stayed many times in Laguna at a few of the beachfront hotels. Our villa at the Retreat was much better, in my opinion, than a beach front hotel even though it is technically not right on the sand. We were in the DaVinci which has 1.5 bathrooms. All the units have full kitchens. Ours was nicely stocked with wine glasses, plates, bowls, flatware, etc.  The bedroom has a queen bed, the sofa turns into a queen sleeper which I found surprisingly comfortable. There were 4 of us who stayed for a ""girls weekend"" so we brought a blow up air mattress too. It was great having the extra bathroom.  They have beach toys, beach chairs and boogie boards available for guest use. The only thing I would bring next time would be a couple of folding chairs to include on the balcony as there",October 2017,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,90,394
