14 helpful votes,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good price for the quality,"The hotel is pretty good for the price. It's not worth the in-room jacuzzi price. The regular room price is good. Keys: they don't use key cards like other hotels, these people use actual keys. Hotel is old. Go to the roomsaver web site and find the hotel there. Get the coupon, you'll save some money. They have a shuttle going to Knott's and Disneyland, but make sure on the hours of their shuttle, departing and returning. Call them.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,44,342
none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Good clean place to stay at a good price,Brookhurst Inn was a clean and a friendly place to stay. The frontdesk clerk was helpful and punctual. If you are looking for a place to day in Anaheim that has a competitive price. Give them a try.,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,45,342
4 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Brookhurst Infestation,"Stayed at Brookhurst on 9/6. Found bathroom infested with bugs (even on towels). Notified manager. He saw them and I was given another room, same floor, three doors down, also infested with bugs. No where else to go. Manager sprayed room. Next morning, more bugs. Notified housekeeping who also saw bugs. Too afraid to take shower. Notifed manager and asked him to come up and view bugs, he refused. Asked for refund -- denied.  This is the first of many letters that I will write about this hotel.  Will also notify health dept.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,46,342

none,none,2.0 of 5 bubbles,very tourist class,"They advertized themselves as AAA approved, but I cannot find a listing for them in the AAA Tour Book 2002. Six of us were traveling and so we booked two rooms; neither were clean; glass rings and food stains on the table and bathroom vanity. They have a 72-hour cancellation policy or we would have left after the first night. The grounds were very unkept and left much to be desired. I would not recommend even as a budget lodging. $69.00 for two double bed room per March 2002.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,48,342
