So, I was very excited to have the opportunity to stay at the brand new Marriott while also knowing the history behind the ownership and build.  The lobby and rooms are nicely appointed.  The d√©cor is modern with nice wood accents that is very welcoming.  The rooms are large with full ceiling to floor windows offering beautiful views of Irvine and the sunset every night.  I was however, disappointed with the cleanliness of the room especially since it is brand new hotel.  The sunshades were dirty and covered with an unknown spray of ""something"".  There were obvious dirt marks on the ceiling.  The toilet area had an odd smell on/around the toilet.  The biggest disappointment was the valet.

I'll echo what another reviewer says about valet - totally unnecessary. Its not DTLA, San Francisco, NYC or other high-density area (heck even downtown San Diego!). I decided to voice my opinion to Marriott re: the valet only feature and although I got a response from the property - it was really just fluff (as witnessed by the Courtyard property on the same lot having self-parking available without any ""issues"").

We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay overall.  We understand that it can be frustrating to valet park when you see our neighboring hotel offering self-parking.  Being different brands within Marriott, we do operate under different business models.  Due to the limited parking within our community (and that our own parking lot is smaller than most full-service Marriott‚Äôs), we have chosen valet parking as our preferred method.  This is to ensure each and every one of our guests is guaranteed a parking spot.  In peak times with ballroom functions, local community enjoying the restaurant outlets, and guests checking in, our valet is able to double stack cars and accommodate everyone coming to the hotel for business or pleasure.  We strive to provide our guests a truly elevated full-service Marriott experience with our valet.  We go to great lengths to inform our guests of the on-site parking fee which are indicated on Marriott.com, in your confirmation email, and upon check-in.  While we wish that all aspects of your visit to our hotel had been extraordinary, we appreciate your feedback.  Warm regards,  Alexandria Huggett",none,none,none,none,none,none,164,137
