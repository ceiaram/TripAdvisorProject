They only provided clean towels.  The breakfast is a bag with an apple, a juice and very bad bread.   It feels like they are using covid 19 as an excuse to save costs on everything.

Its okay for the price. At least the room was clean. What was weird is that they dont have a shower or tub, just a hole in the floor and the toilet is next to it. So if someone took a shower and you need to use a restroom, you literally have to sit ankles dip in water. Also, there are no door to separate a closet and restroom so if someone using a restroom, you cant get into the closet. Very weird set up.  Air conditioner was bad. It either super cold or super hot.

Only complaint would be the parking is awful!! Very small spaces. Front desk clerk seems annoyed when I asked him where we could park as the lot was full. A few things to improve. The shuttle was great!! Larger than it used to be. Still need to have more pick up times in the early afternoon and evening. Also the breakfast needs improvements. Not much but sugar and carb loaded choices. Also as far as the room, our couch was covered with stains. Cleaning it would have made the room much more appealing.

none,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointed,We stayed here for 2 nights. The free Disneyland shuttle they offer was a van that came every hour and only in the morning and night. We planned on coming back to the hotel so the little ones could nap but the van they had didn't run at those times . The breakfast was a joke all they had to offer was half a burnt waffle and toast. The room was small and the sofa bed that we had for the kids was right by the ac and we couldn't use it. The pillows were lumpy and flat. We only had one washcloth in our room. We also had a room on the second floor and with kids and luggage and no elevator made it very difficult to get in and out of our room.

The lady who worked that area was on top of refilling items as they ran out, as well as preparing the waffles for the guests.  The pool/hot tub area is the perfect setting to watch Disney's fireworks.  Speaking of Disney- they squeezed about 15 of us into the shuttle which was tight, but I was still grateful that we didn't have to walk.

First we were placed in a room in a very dark walkway at the end of the building.  No natural light so that was a real turnoff.  The rooms themselves have recently been redone and were pretty nice and clean mind you this hotel is OLD.  Improvements:  Better towels and it would have been nice to have more than one washcloth for four people in the room.  It does not pay to be frugal on these types of things.  Bed linens could have been a bit better as well, the beds although new are VERY firm so keep this in mind if your used to a softer bed.

So my friend and I would leave our room early to make sure we got on, but there was no line or ""first come first serve"" rule. Everyone would just crowd around the van when the driver got there and whoever pushed and elbowed their way in the van would get a spot. The driver didn't care to help or intervene.

The pool was also cloudy and filled with floating hair, you could smell the chlorine from across the complex.

none,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Reasonable for the price.,"I stayed here with my mom for a long weekend at Disneyland.   Pros:  Location. It's  about 1/2 mile from the parks. Shuttle. Comes every hour on the half hour; I stress how great this is in the evening, when you're tired. Price. We paid about $60/night.  Front desk. There is always someone to help you, even if they forget to follow-up (more on that below). I left my coat in my room after checking out, and they held it in the reception until I came back for it.   Cons: Sound proofing. You can hear every car, footfall, and handrail grasp. This didn't bother us, but if you're a light sleeper, be wary (and not weary ;0] ). Service follow-up.
