Rooms were decent, clean and functional and free parking was great. We arrived at 07:00 for a 3pm check in as we were going to Disneyland for the day and the front desk staff were more than happy to let us park anyway - very handy.

Both days we were there we left the park in the afternoon then returned for the evening shows. This was great for that as it was so close to the parks.

The location is awesome, 10 min walk to the parks and close to stores like Walgreens, CVS, 7-Eleven and Starbucks. They have a small continental breakfast, no hot foods but enough to get you fueled up for the day. Still plenty of choices like cereal, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, muffins and juice. We booked a family room that has 2 beds and bathroom in main room,there is a small second bedroom with one bed which was perfect for our group.

We enjoyed being so close to Dland and I was slightly concerned about being directly behind Carsland but there was minimal noise that is only heard if the window in your bathroom is open.

The very minute I received the e-mail I called them, and the guy that answered could just tell me that my card was rejected and thus ""the system"" automatically canceled my reservation. I argued a little bit, saying that the card used was a company card that for sure was good to be charged, but trying to solve my problem quickly, I just asked what solution could he offer me, given the situation.

Management did not provide the family suite room as reserved, (directly with hotel), no crib was provided as requested.  the room was dirty,  smelly and poorly furnished.  The cramped parking area was noisey and dirty.  We  ran from the property in the morning as soon as we had a room reserved at another hotel.....oh  since when is hot coffee considered a "" continental breakfast""?....save your money and your time and stay elsewhere.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1226,94
2 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,My favorite place to stay for Disney visit,The Alpine is the most convenient and affordable motel near Disneyland.  It's cute vintage exterior makes it's irresistable to venture insite.  The rooms have some vintage appeal but have unfortunatelly overgone some renovations taking away the charm of this older motel.  I still recommend this bargain quaint motel for Disney visitors!,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1227,94
2 helpful votes,4 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,close & affordable,"This motel was close to the Disney parking lot, where we were shuttled to the park entrance. Rooms were very clean & affordable, (our 2 room suite was cheaper than singles in the hotels across from the Disney entrance. The staff were very friendy & accomodating. Small, quiet complex with clean pool. Would recommend to others & stay again.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1228,94
3 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Alpine, bargain right next door to Disneyland","My daughter and I stayed at the Alpine.  We never had to move our car once during our 4 day stay. Ate all our meals at Disneyland restaurants - easy to do with the money we saved by staying at the Alpine.   We walked to a Disney parking lot walk-in entrance just 1 1/2 blocks away where we boarded a Disney Tram to the park.  The Alpine rooms are spotless - TV worked great - pool was clean.  Coffee was there daily.  This is a family-run and occupied business.  An incredible bargain - surrounded by big, much, much higher priced hotels, but closer to the park.  A convenience store was on the next block.  We plan on returning.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1229,94
none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best spot outside of Disneyland,"For more than 20 years, we've stayed at Alpine Motel on every visit to Disneyland (average about twice a year).  Before discovering Alpine, we stayed at many other places including  Disneyland Hotel.  Alpine motel is, obviously, our favorite.  Very close to the park, economical, quiet, clean.   It has a friendly, efficient, competent management.  If you can't stay in one of those VIP rooms on the park's Main St, stay at Alpine Motel.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1230,94
