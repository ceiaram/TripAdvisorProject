6 helpful votes,18 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A pleasant stay that met most expectations,"We stayed here for 5 nights to visit Disneyland.  The property is clean and updated and we'll kept. I was impressed with how well staffed the property was- from the parking attendant,  valet staff, to security and front desk personnel.  Most were very friendly too! The room was a nice size and well appointed for a value motel. We had a room on the 5th floor. Unfortunately,  we were behind the elevator shift which makes a lot of noise. Other than that, the walls seem well insulated and there wasn't a lot of other noise to deal with. Housekeeping only comes every 3 days, so they only came once in a 5 day stay. That's really not acceptable. 3 people living out of one room, it's going to need cleaned and replenished.

Sadly, my latest stay at the Marriott Fairfield proved to be more like an unrestored original Volkswagen Beetle - kind of interesting to look at, but squashed on the inside and not somewhere you'd want to spend a lot of time.  Specific complaints: we reserved a two queen beds room. On arrival, we were placed on the ground floor, adjacent to the vehicle parking, and next to the laundry room. There wasn't even a closet.

The valet company always greeted us when we returned to the hotel, check in and check out went fairly smoothly.

It's less than a 10 minute walk to Disney security, and is very near some easy food options (Mimi's Cafe, McDonalds, Panera).

The staff at the hotel are very friendly, and our room was always very clean. The only downside was that the airconditioning in our room was so loud when it was running, and unfortunately it was too hot to not have it on - I didn't sleep well because of this.

It's in a perfect location, right across the street from both parks- you can actually see portions of Magic Kingdom from some of the balconies that face the parks. It's probably a 10 minute walk to the entrance to both.   I gave an excellent rating because of its general closeness to the parks and cleanliness. The rooms were nice and updated, with a Disney theme. No breakfast - but there is a Panera that you have to walk by in the morning to head to the Disney area that worked just fine for us to get coffee and a bagel on our way over (much cheaper than breakfast in the parks!)

There are several local choices.  This one is the least expensive across the street from the park.  Your tip is to ask for a room facing Disneyland vs. the Freeway.  It is much quieter and you can see the fireworks show.  They have quick cheap food onsite and very close to many restaurants. They have a pool. Parking is $19 a day.

Its definitely not anything more luxurious than that, but it was solid for our purposes.  As advertised, it is a short walk to Disneyland and CA Adventure - about 10 min, even for my 5 year old's short legs.   The rooms are what you would expect from a 2.5 star hotel - nothing fancy, and unfortunately it had shower curtains (touching hotel shower curtains is a particular fear of mine), I thought the two queen beds were pretty reasonable, but my husband found it rather uncomfortable.   The big problem for me was the temperature control - it was either super cold AC or heat coming out of the vents.

The main room had the 2 queens and the sofa chair, with the side room having the queen sofa bed.   Note that there is NO door between the two rooms, so you can't close that room off.     The sink area included an open closet space and the mini fridge and safe.  The sliding door closes this space off from the sleeping area, but the door has frosted glass so it DOES emit light into the sleeping area when you turn on the sink",February 2017,none,none,"Thank you for choosing our hotel for your family getaway to Disneyland!

Rennovated a old hotel room and pictures that were shown on web sight looked nothing like what  you see at the hotel.  The rooms were updated.  No carpet on the floors. Laminate tile.  Not as kid friendly has had hoped.  If you request an upper level you are supposed to be able to see the fireworks from Disneyland.  Requested upper rooms we got a view of the busy highway and below was all the metal containers for there rennovations.  Doors did not close tight and all you heard was the traffic all night.   Metal railing around building.  Friendly staff.  Had a snack and pizza area with game room on 3rd floor.  If you stay request front of building. Much better view.  Small but nice pool area on front of,February 2017,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to write a review.

This is a perfect place to stay.  Good price, convenient location - my only complaints would be there weren't a lot of choices at the hotel for food (McDonalds and Panera is basically in the driveway) and the housekeeping knocked on my door at 7:30 a.m. on Sunday morning.
