4 helpful votes,6 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Clean and quiet,"I needed a place to stay locally for a few nights and found this one at a reasonable price.  Contrary to other reviews, my room was clean and comfortable.  Had a little sitting room with a tv, and a separate bedroom, also with tv.  The decor is dated, but it reminded me of the quaint little boutique hotels in Europe. The free wi-fi was reliable and parking was free.  Convenient walking distance to local eateries. There was a mini-fridge and a microwave oven.  Even though my room faced a busy street, the windows were good enough to mitigate the traffic noise. Free breakfast was less than satisfactory.  Some cereal, instant oatmeal packets, Cup-a-Noodles, two loaves of bread and a toaster. I never felt unsafe.  There was a homeless guy hanging out at the 7/11 across the street,",October 2022,Ask for a room toward the back of the hotel if you want to avoid street noise.,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,385
