I want to start off by stating I travel often and I am used to staying in a variety of places, but this location was unacceptable.  First of all, the place smells terrible and like it has not been cared for in years. The bathroom is super small, almost to a point of being dangerous. You are touching the sink as you are using the toilet. All of the wires are run under a carpet and plugged into the same extension cord (which is using the only outlet in the room), which is a clear fire hazard. My husband, who is 5´8,´´had his feet hanging off the bed. The paint was chipping off the night stands and other places around the room as well, including the balcony. The carpet felt like it really had not been cleaned in months, if not longer. we",September 2021,Please research other hotels along the strip.

1 helpful vote,9 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Do not stay here!!!,"My boyfriend and I came to this location last year and had a nice time so we decided to come back this year.  BIG MISTAKE!!  Never in my life have I been so disappointed with a travel experience.  The pictures listed  on Airbnb are absolutely nothing close to what you actually get.   We walked into our room to discover it was uninhabitable hot!  We found a fan in the “closet” of the bedroom but it didn’t do much as it is the middle of summer in California.  We contacted our host David who took his sweet time to ensure we got another fan...three hours later!!!  By this time our experience had been ruined and we had decided to leave.   The floors are disgusting, as is the bathroom.  You cannot comfortably sit on the toilet without your face nearly hitting the sink and the shower",July 2018,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,505
19 helpful votes,56 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,The Coast Inn now on Airbnb-Nightmare on 1401 S Coast Hwy,"Obviously the Coast Inn is closed, nevertheless the rooms still get rented via Airbnb. My wife and I were thrilled and excited to spend some days at the beach. The pictures, the description, the reviews all looked flawless. We prepaid almost 500 $ for two days.  We arrived at the proposed time. All doors were closed, and the placed looked like a resemblance of a crime scene in NYC. Next to the building is a construction site, that is filled and smells like a landfill, the access to the beach is closed. Once we managed to find our way to the apartment, we could not believe our eyes. Everything was covered with rust and dirt. The patio, the lounge chairs the umbrella look like a scenery for a horror movie. Once we managed to enter the rented flat, it was nothing like the pictured",April 2017,Dont go there it is a dump,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,505

My teenage son, fiancé, and myself had to share 4 towels between the 3 of us for 4 days! The view is absolutely breathtaking and makes up for anything lacked. We had an end room on the top floor and it had to have been the best view.

30 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,This Place Should Be Condemned!,"I had the displeasure of staying at the Coast Inn on May 23, 2007.  This hotel should be condemned.  The paint is peeling off the wall, the bathrooms are absolutely filthy, nothing has been dusted in ages.  I contacted the housekeeper to bring me a clean pillow case because the pillow cases appeared to have what looked like blood stains on them.  She was down right belligerent when she showed up to replace the pillow case swearing everythhing was cleaned.  Very unprofessional and it broke the Number One rule of customer service...the customer is always right.  This is not a family hotel by any means;  it is essentially a whorehouse atop a gay bar that blasts music until 3 AM.  Unfortunately, you won't be able to complain to the front desk as the front office closes at 8 PM.  If",May 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,7,505
6 helpful votes,4 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Awesome views!,I've been to Laguna many years ago. On this next trip I was unaware of the change of ownership. I made my reservation by phone & they were very kind & courteous. The rooms are nicer than I remembered them. I'm assuming some refurbishing had been done.   The hotel is an older hotel but the tranquility of that beautiful ocean view & being rocked to sleep by the waves was exactly what I needed on this trip. The price is very good considering how close to the ocean I was. The staff was very accomadating & friendly.   There is no continental breakfast but there is a restaurant below in the Boom Boom Room called the Boom Cafe that has  excellent food.   I can't wait until my next visit!

13 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Used to be great -- now it's just SAD,"The Coast Inn has never been notable for its amenities, but I used to stay there because it was right above the famous Boom Boom Room. It's rather pricey for what you get, but it's a gay hotel and I wanted to support it. However, the last straw was my most recent visit. I called the day I wanted reservations there, and I asked what was going on at the Boom Boom Room that night, since the bar and hotel share the same staff and management. I was told it was business as usual, so I made the reservation and checked in a few hours later. I took a nap and went out to the bar around 10pm. The place was dead. Forty-five minutes later, the LAST CALL was announced. The place was closing before 11pm! Apparently, if there are not enough people in the bar, they now close down early, whenever",January 2006,none,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,9,505

Right above The Boom,"The Coast Inn is the PERFECT place to stay in Orange County for the Gay/Lesbian traveler.  It is fight above the largest Gay club in Orange Co., not to far from ""Downtown Laguna"", and only 1 block from the other gay clubs in Laguna Beach.    Personally, I would recommend one of the Suites facing the Beach and overlooking the ocean.  The sunset over Catalina Island is to die for!
