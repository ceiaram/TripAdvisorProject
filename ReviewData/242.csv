Since I was coming down with a cold, it was also nice that they have a little convenience store by the front desk where you can pick up Advil and decongestants.

4 helpful votes,7 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very nice, fresh new hotel","Decent stay for the price, full kitchens so bring some food. Breakfast was OK but I cook better than they do. The social hour was sans alcohol due to liquor license issues, may be corrected by now. If you are choosing based on the happy hour, call and check. I wish hotels would include notes about things that are out of order or not available during the booking process. I feel ripped off when I choose a place with specific amenities (pool, hot tub, social hour, etc.) and find out upon check in one or more of them are not working/available!",April 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,617,242

Indeed it was a great experience, two of the front desk agents by the name of Brett and Hector were extremely nice and helpful with getting us situated at the hotel. As for the housekeeper Gloria, she is absolutely outstanding at her job. I would have to say that she went above and beyond her call of duty with cleaning. I am definitely making another trip to this hotel ASAP it is so beautiful here. Anyone out there deciding to take a peek or even a tad bit interested in getting the Homewood suites experience should definitely give it a whirl spin :).",March 2016,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,624,242
