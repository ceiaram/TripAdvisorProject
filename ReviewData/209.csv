We walk to our room: the floor smelled of marijuana, but once we get to our room we couldn't smell it. Upon getting to the room we find that one bed was half made. We couldn't be sure that the room wasn't entirely cleaned, and didn't feel comfortable sleeping in this bed, so we went back to the front desk where they promptly apologized and assigned us a new room. At the time it was frustrating due to exhaustion, but in retrospect I appreciate how quick the front desk was about rectifying this.   For two twenty-somethings who just needed a place to sleep for a few hours before heading back to the parks, our stay was just fine.

Yes they are fairly clean, and the staff seems to be trying hard, but its time for a full reno.    We booked with Expedia, and received notice that the breakfast buffet was included with the room. We booked 2 rooms for 4 nights, 8 guests in total.   After we checked in, we were informed it would be a plated breakfast for the adults only, kids under 3 eat free, kids 4-17 need to purchase separate meals. When we objected , the front desk referred us to the dining room manager, who referred us to the front desk.  Every morning we had to retell the whole story and show them our Expedia confirmation.

1 helpful vote,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a good place to stay while visiting Disneyland.,"Our AAA office booked this hotel for us as we were on our way out of town on a spur of the moment trip to see Disneyland. The hotel was friendly and clean, and the price was more than reasonable at $69 per night.They had a free Hot breakfast for us every morning served buffet style with lots of clean tables and plenty to eat. They offered food to order as well as the buffet for a fee and had a short menu for lunch. The location was about 6 miles away but a straight shot to Disneyland parking and they offered a shuttle to take us and also pick us up in the evening, which saved the $15 parking fee. The hotel rooms were large and clean and the pool was in a lovely setting. They also offered a nice exercise room which we did not use after our 2 days at Disneyland.",June 2010,none,none,Thanks for your review. We are so glad you enjoyed your stay at our hotel.

Decor very out dated and tacky from the 80s; hallway carpets had bleach stains all over them. would never stay there again. Not worth the money",June 2010,none,none,"I apologize to hear about your experience.  I'll try and address specific issues here.  OWNERSHIP CHANGE As of March 18, 2010, we obtained ownership of the hotel, so we're working hard on addressing the short comings of the property.  FURNITURE CONDITION There were  major renovations to the rooms as of 2005 when the hotel was a Wyndham.  I'd have to see the specific room regarding the condition of the furniture.  TV RECEPTION It may have been a particular room that had problems.  Any issues can typically be resolved easily by notifying the front desk.  Worse case scenario we usually are able to accommodate a room change or even free upgrade.  ELEVATOR PROBLEMS One of the elevators was down for extensive, emergency maintenance.  I apologize for the inconvenience.  NO ICE I'll talk to my maintenance staff about checking all the ice machines for any problems.  NO FREE WI-FI The free wi-fi is limited to the lobby along with free computers you can use with Internet.  I'm currently working with AT&T about getting free wi-fi to the rest of the rooms.  NOISE If there are particular noisy rooms, we can get that addressed by letting the front desk know.  SIDE TIP: a room in the ""tower building"" is typically the quietest.  Also, if you're sensitive to noise, please let the front desk know at the time of check in and we can move you rooms.  Thanks again for your feedback and please let the front desk know of any problems during your stay and we can usually take care of most issues.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1155,209
none,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Not bad for the money,"We stayed here in June 2010. The only complaint I have is the tv channels sucked. There was really nothing on tv when we came back in the evening. Also, they advertise free wireless internet, but that is not in your room. I thought that was a bit of false advertising. Other than those 2 issues, no complaints on the room or cleanliness or staff. Nothing was excellent, but it also wasn't bad. When we booked, they offered free hot breakfasts so that was nice. Also, parking is free. I'd stay again because it was a good price for the area. If you have AAA, you get a discount so use that.",June 2010,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1156,209

We have chosen this place because our bus tour had this hotel as one of the pick up point. We stayed there for two days, overall experience was good.  Staff was friendly and agile. We wanted to leave car baby seat for couple of days at the hotel as we had plan to return to the same hotel later, they kept it with full care.   They do provide free internet in the room but for some reason we could not connect to wifi due to laptop problem, we were disappointed to know that there is no free computer there to be used in that situation.",March 2010,none,none,"Thank you for your review.  We are currently working on getting free Internet in the rooms.  In about late March or early April, I installed free Internet in the lobby and installed two kiosk computers, so the next time you come out, you should be able to use those for free.

It's hard to have to choose between comfort and cost when you're on a budget and when it comes down to it, comfort which includes cleanliness and quality takes priority. At Anaheim Park Hotel, not only have i experienced cleanliness and quality but I've also found it to be very reasonably priced.  Just entering the lobby area for check in gives a feeling of comfort and luxury.  It is a very nice hotel. I've received great friendly service everytime I've been a guest.  It is right off the freeway with easy access to many shops and restaurants including a grocery store.  It's less than 10 minutes away from major Orange County tourist attractions.

none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,TRAVELERS BEWARE,"This has got to be the most god awful place I have ever been. I got a deal on a discount site, and folks, you get what you pay for. The service was terrible, they have a pathetic excuse for a Disneyland tram, as the bus rarely runs, the walls are paper thin, and the place is busy and noisy night and day. My husband and I got no sleep and were miserable at Disneyland the next day. We didn't get to the hotel until around 2:30am, and we weren't planning on getting to Disneyland first thing in the morning, but we decided to go ahead and go because there was a choir group there at the same time we were, that started vocalizing at 7am. Not that we got any sleep before they started in. Our trip was completely ruined. And as if that wasn't bad enough, they charged $75 to my bank card",May 2010,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1160,209
