It's quite a long walk to Disneyland but you can get an Uber to take you right there for $6 each way, and Ubers seemed to be plentiful and quick. Very pleasant if not really luxurious stay for a Disneyland vacation. Ample parking, there are a handful of EV chargers - we were lucky enough to snag one, but they do get filled up and some EV drivers use up a spot even if they're not charging (very, very annoying), but if you do get a spot the charging is free. Biggest downside is the shower water pressure in our room wasn't great, TVs didn't have ChromeCast like some newer Hyatts, etc. Overall I'd say it's a very decent place to stay.

The hotel is about 0.75 m (according to my GPS watch) away from the shuttle dropoff area at the Disneyland parks entrance. We had no issues walking to and from the parks daily.

So, as far as park access, I think this location is great!   Hyatt Place offers free breakfast daily. The breakfast consisted of pre-made plates of sausage, scrambled eggs, and tater tots.

They took care of it very efficiently. Every staff member, from hosts to cleaning to breakfast crew, were really friendly and helpful and efficient. The hotel itself was all right. It would probably be fantastic for families with children. For a single person trying to attend a conference for work, it was a bit loud - the walls are very thin, and there are a TON of children who were either excited early in the morning or really upset at the end of the day.

Hyatt Place was a little bit cheaper, it was just me and I was only staying one night, so I opted for it.  It was a great choice.  I would say that this is the edge of reasonable walking distance to Disneyland.  It's about a mile from the hotel to the park entrance.

The tools made regular, weird chugging sounds, the air-conditioner made a loud clunking when it would turn off and the window covering would suction when the air came on and would smack the window and the tv flickered on and off continually (that was fixed). I did let the hotel know about these situations twice. Ohhhh...and you can hear EVERYTHING on the other side of the wall. The first morning I listen to someone having a very gassy bowel movement next door to me. Made me nervous that they could hear every movement and sound I made in my room.

1 helpful vote,2 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hyatt over promised on check-in, highly disappointed on delivery","As a World of Hyatt member, I was looking to get an early check-in for my two rooms. After an early start at Disney, I find it to be a good family strategy to get some rest during the hot afternoon and go back in the evening. It was hot, we were tired, even a half hour earlier check-in would have made a world of difference.   I called in advance and the front office person Ken noted that this was possible and that he would leave a message - he said one room would likely be ready, but we may need to  check in about the other one.   I arrived at about 1pm and was able to check in early on one room, however the other (a king suite with bunk beds) one wasn't ready yet. I asked Samantha if they could accelerate it a bit since my family was needing some rest in the afternoon. She said",April 2019,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,659,91

This time we had a king standard room, the bed was really comfortable. My only suggestion would still be that I wish they would add blackout curtains to their rooms, but everything else is great. Breakfast good as usual with hot breakfast options. Our only issue was resolved as soon as I called the hotel. We used the hyatt app to check out (first time using their app) and a few days later I realized the hotel had charged a different night rate than the original rate I had reserved it for.

We made reservations on the hotel’s website the evening of. When we arrived later that night we were told the hotel was fully booked. The lady at the desk said they knew there was something wrong with their website that caused the website to sometimes give confirmation numbers that weren’t real. Then she tried to put us in a more expensive room with a price break. (If you’ll recall this conversation started with the assertion the hotel was fully booked.) The happy-ish ending to the story is that she eventually found us a room at less than the rate we expected to pay but not before we almost walked out to try to find a different place to stay late at night.,February 2019,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,715,91

Upon arriving the staff member at the desk was extremely friendly and answered all of our questions. The hotel looks very grand as you approach it and the lobby is equally attractive. The rooms were clean and big, the only let down was the very dated bathroom. The only other gripe I have is that the bed sheets felt cheap. The TV had some great channels for the short periods of time we were in the room. There is a small shop in the lobby to grab some snacks/water, but it is extremely over priced. There is also a Starbucks on site, but it can get very busy in the mornings. The fitness room was great.

It seems like in the area it is either 2 stars for around  $100 per night or you are in this bracket for a better quality hotel.  My bill for  4 nights was $980.00, breakfast is included in the room charge, this includes parking charges and a few late night food charges. Parking is an extra charge but has in and out privileges and is secure. The room was excellent, comfortable beds and I am picky about that. Air conditioning worked well and was not noisy. We had a corner room so not sure if the air conditioning was in a different place than most rooms, but it was wonderful that it did NOT blow directly on the beds.

Secondly, the walls were extremely thin in that I was woken by loud rumbles which I assumed were the upstairs neighbords opening and closing their french doors.

Apparently, the young man who was working at the front desk was also the bartender.  As such, he was juggling both which is not good when there is a bachelorette party at the bar.

I immediately called in the morning and spoke to Addie, who helped me find my wife's clothes. She then went, during her lunch, to Fed Ex and shipped them that day!!

No slamming doors, no screaming kids in the hall, no thin walls - just a great place to spend the evening.

This is the second time that we have stayed at the Hyatt and if staying off site, it is very hard to beat. Location is great and is close to Disneyland but so too are many other hotels. What I really like is the fact that the hotel has its own shuttle that runs to and form the park. For $6 per day, one can ride the shuttle to and from the parks an unlimited number of times without stopping at any other location. That is HUGE, as many other shuttles will stop multiple times before arriving at the park. Also, rooms are nice. We had a normal room with two queens and the coast was approximately $600 for three nights. There is also a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel which is nice for early mornings.

Our room was clean and met our expectations based on website. We even got to check in early after a 7 hour drive from N. Cali.   Beds are comfy and plush but if you plan to use pull out sofa bed, it's typically not comfortable for an adult.

We stayed in the bunk bed suite, but were surprised at how small the space was considering it had a door closure separation between the two sleeping areas.  When researching the room appears large and we were banking on the doors providing privacy for us after the kids went to bed.    If you are considering this room, I would also research the large double queen suite.  For the same price it was twice as big and has a kitchenette and dining area as well as a very large bathroom area.  The doors in our bunk suite were opaque and offered little to no light or sound privacy between the two sleeping areas.  So there was no privacy advantage.

My only two concerns were noise related. Firstly the AC seemed very noisy which was a little annoying. And secondly the floors/walls must be a little thin because we could hear kids running outside or upstairs from the room, which was also a tiny bit annoying.

But since you have brought this to our attention, the ART shuttle service representative has provided us with an updated Ticket Order Form that includes the Reduced Fare Tickets so that we will now have these available to folks that qualify for the lower priced ticket.  I did also check our brand web site as well as a very well known online travel web site and both sites do mention our parking policy.  Parking fees in Anaheim Resort area hotels are common amongst most branded hotels (Hyatt, Holiday Inn, etc) and helps to ensure that overnight parking is restricted to hotel guests and not transient parking of visitors that may not be guests of the hotel.

Low to no service – – for example if you wanted to order food it was available to pick up downstairs. The pool area was basically nonexistent.
