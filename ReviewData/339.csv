This Travelodge was the closest inexpensive motel that I could find.  I just needed a place to sleep and take a shower.  This place fit the bill.  The room was large (much larger than typical for a motel and much more than I needed).  It was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The motel was far enough from the I-5 freeway that there was not much noise.  The layout was a little unusual as the tub/shower was open to the main room.

Space is at such a premium that the Coke and ice machines are outside the lobby in the parking garage.  Honestly, I might have given this rating an ""average"" instead of ""poor"" except for the fact that our room reeked of pot. We thought it was a previous guest after the scent went away, but the next morning, it came back in full force, leading us to think it was someone across the hall. Now, hotels can't always control its guests. But we were staying there over Christmas with our family, which made it worse.

They have lower end rooms that have no such balcony and designed poorly.

We do our best to make each and every customer’s stay enjoyable and welcoming, and our staff treats everyone with the upmost kindness and respect. As many of our customers can attest, we provide a friendly environment and genuinely enjoy chatting with them throughout their stay. Moreover, we take it upon ourselves to ensure each of our registered guests receive the peace and amenities they are entitled to, including a parking space and easily available access to internet. As a result, we have a large number of returning guests who find our staff helpful and personable.   With all of this in mind, it should be dually noted that these guests violated our basic hotel policies in this particular situation. They attempted to sneak in extra guests through our back entrance and even occupied three (3) parking spots in our limited parking lots. We do not allow guests after 6pm and only offer 1 parking spot per registered guest in order to respect other customers’ right to a space. Additionally, neighboring guests made noise complaints about their room, and it is our responsibility to address such issues and ensure we maintain an appropriate noise level for all customers. In regards to accommodations, these customers specifically chose their room despite our staff warning them that it was the smallest we had available in the array of room options we had to offer. We have always been more than willing to print multiple copies of the internet password for our guests, and take pride in the fact we offer free internet access when most motels and hotels charge for this service. Finally, we do in fact offer a full breakfast every morning, but these guests checked out early (before breakfast was served at 7am).   Again, we are sorry for any hassle these customers experienced as well as for any resulting disturbance our other guests experienced that evening, but we take our motel policies seriously and want to ensure all our guests are treated fairly and given the privacy and access they deserve.
