The location was convenient to Angel Stadium, for those interested there, easy walking distance. It was also a quick drive to the hospital/clinic I needed to visit. For the price, this was a nice option. The room was spacious and worked fine for my needs. The bathroom felt a little dated but worked; its location, at least in the room I was in, was a little strange, off of the main area instead of the separate bedroom. Probably a good arrangement if you have kids/others on the sofa bed, I would have been happier with it in the bedroom. But it worked fine.

The location is excellent, close to Anaheim Stadium and all of the major freeways. The rooms are average, you can definitely tell it’s outdated but they were clean, quiet rooms. Check in service was terrible; you could tell the girl working the desk was miserable and it reflected in her service. I politely asked if there were any room upgrades available since I’m a titanium member and after much huffing and puffing by the girl she responded “well I guess since you’re only here for one night and I can honor that since you are a elite member.” Wow thanks for doing me a favor when your hotel parking lot is practically empty.

Two main ones were the distance to Honda Center (20 minute walk) and the fact that they were one of the few that had two bedroom suites - the other being Residence Inn, but even they seem to be eliminating the two-bedroom options in many of their locations.  Price was the third, but you then get what you pay for, as the old adage goes.  First and foremost, it was not very clean.

I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks.   The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island.

I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew.

Next, the cons: * Room smelled like some cleaner that I couldn't identify.  I don't know if the smell was to cover something else. * The line for the two waffle makers was ridiculous.  We waited over 30 minutes to make a waffle. * The seating area for breakfast is very small.   * There are no meats/eggs for breakfast.  This is unusual for a TownePlace.

My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed.  The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred.  In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving.  As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet.   As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made.   Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable.  We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that.  As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.  The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests.  We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms.   again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect.  We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium.",none,none,none,none,none,none,495,222

Great deal for the $ - would definitely stay here again.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,699,222
15 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Not As Advertised,"Even thouth we had reserved a two room suite and confirmed a two room suite, we got a one room with a bed and a sofa.  We were still charged the same as a two room suite and our complaints went unanswered with the desk staff repeatedly assuring us that the room was a two room suite.  The room was so small that the sofa bed had to be folded up for people in the bed to move to the other side of the room.  Not what was expected of Marriott.  Fortunately, it was short trip and we had relatives near by or the family would have been at each others throats cramped up in there.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,700,222
63 helpful votes,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,TownePlace Suites was sweet!,"We stayed for 6 nights at the end of July 2004. Originally scheduled for 7 nights we needed to leave a day early (no fault of hotel) and they were very gracious about it. Our room was spotless and well appointed as stated on their web site. Staff was very helpful. Pool was not very big but clean- most important! Location was fantastic....45 minutes from LA, 5 minutes from Disney, 30 minutes from Legoland, beaches and more. Easy access to and from, highways. A nice food court is in the same plaza. This would be a great hotel for families, especially baseball fans. You can see the Angels Stadium from the hotel.  The only negative is a train track running along the parking lot, parking is free, by the way. We quickly tuned it out and had no trouble sleeping.

7 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Big 2 bdrm suite!,"We got a 2 Bdrm suite, which was perfect for us. Close by to Disneyland (5 min drive).Our baby slept in a crib (provided by hotel with linens) in the living room, our older son had his own room, and my husband & I had a room. There were 3 tvs, a fold out sofa and a full kitchen. The pool and jacuzzi were nice. The only bad thing was the train going by, but we got used to it and it never caused us to wake up.  The staff was very friendly and quick to help.  Restaurants were close by but we brought our own snacks and drinks. Will definitely stay here again. My husband loved the morning delivery of newspaper and my son loved having his own room with a view of pool and train tracks.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,703,222
8 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Perfect for families,"We stayed in a two bedroom apartment during our stay in Anaheim in June 2004. We have two young children (3 and 5). The apartment was clean and well equipped. The beds were comfy and the linen fresh. We loved the location, near Dennys, Starbucks, Panda Express and Mc Donalds. We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels. I highly recommend this hotel to families with young children, we were very impressed.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,704,222
10 helpful votes,3 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Amtrak Coming Thru,"Our family stayed in the suite. It wasn't spotless (needed vacuuming and had bees that kept coming in through the kitchen window). After stuffing the seams with papertowels we were able to be bee-free for our stay. The staff was friendly whenever we spoke with them. The pool was average size, the kids didn't seem to mind that it wasn't over-sized.  The biggest problem we had didn't have anything to do with the hotel.  Amtrak has a station not far from the hotel. The tracks for the trains (both Amtrac and cargo) are directly past the parking lot. Not across the street, not a block or two away, right outside the hotel parking lot. The trains blow their horns 3 times everytime they pass thru. Not only do you hear the horns, but also the ding-ding-ding of the railroad cross-bars",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,705,222

4 helpful votes,10 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,GREAT for Families,"What a great place to stay when you have a family. The 2 bedroom units were of a very good size,very clean,quite and comfortable.It's location so close to all different types of food outlets and attractions made this all the more enjoyable. We liked the quite atmosphere away from the Disney District ,but you are still close enough to Disneyland(10mins by bus). There was only one small problem and that was with the bedding in the second bedroom,they provide Queen size beds and were they should have some units with two singles instead, which would suit the needs of a family of 4 better.",September 2003,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,707,222
