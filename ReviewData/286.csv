Also, lots of food choices in the area which are in walking distance. Also, easy access to all those crowded freeways.  Close to a shopping center too.

He then did everything he could to make my stay pleasant. Benny is great and an asset to Extended Stay America.  The rooms were nice but not quite as updated as some of the other Extended Stays. My stay was very pleasant and the room was very clean. The kitchen was property stocked with pots/pans/utinsils/flatware/coffee. There is also complimentary coffee in the morning from 7a until 9:30a.

I was a little unnerved that the back door kept getting proped open even after I closed it....just a security concern.  Room was clean and kitchen was nice although it was set up for 2 guests while our room had 2 double beds. Didn't use the cooking facilities so didn't bother asking for extra set-ups.  Breakfast was ""grab and go"" including muffins, oatmeal, coffee, juice and bananas.  Lots of parking...would accommodate trailers or RVs.",June 2012,none,none,"Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at Extended Stay America Orange County - Yorba Linda.
