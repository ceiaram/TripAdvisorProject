When we got there we were shocked how big the room was and how nicely decorated. The service was great and everyone was so nice. The only thing I wasn't super happy about was the towels and bedding... something softer and less scratchy would have been nice... but nothing crazy.

My family of 4 and I were going to be at Disney most of the time so we didn't spend much time there.  Although the rooms were clean and the shower drained properly (both things I look for in a hotel) the beds were a little too soft.  My husband kept sinking in and he's not a big man.  I slept in the other bed with my daughter and I had no problem with the bed sinking in (I do weigh 110 lbs).  The breakfast wasn't that great.  I was expecting waffles we could make ourselves; instead, the waffles were like the frozen Eggo waffles you put in a toaster.  They also had two kinds of cereal and donuts.

Rooms are clean and come with both a microwave and mini fridge.  Cons: do not stay at this hotel unless you plan on spending all day everyday of your stay at Disneyland. They have a very inconvenient parking system where they double up the cars in each stall so that one car essentially blocks the other one in. If you happen to be the inside car you are trapped unless the other person is there to move their car. The hotel tries to coordinate this system based on when people say they plan on checking out, but the bottom line is they can't guarantee that the car will move/leave when they say they will.

I requested a room not near the elevator or ice machine.  When we arrived to check in, I had to remind the woman at the check in counter about that, she was kind enough to follow through.  As the evening got later, there was a number of other guests who proceeded to stand near our room (319).  There was a rail which overlooked the parking lot on the third floor.  Their presence of loud voices, music, smoking and constant walking back and forth by our room was annoying and quite disturbing.... It was difficult to have peace and relaxation, not until after midnight when things finally quite down.  I would not recommend this room at the end due to the noise factor from other rude guests.  We checked out early",June 2013,none,none,"I'm sorry you had an unpleasant experience.  Everyday we have guests left items, big or small, behind upon check out.  It really is impossible to ship everything with different rates so we implemented a standard charge of $25 to send back all items regardless of where you live.  We use standard USPS envelope and if it fits then we ship it back without having to concern the guest about the rates.  Room 319 is a very corner room and many guests enjoy that because it does overlook the back area.  If at anytime our guests inform us of the noise from other hotel guests, we will inform the guests and ask them to keep it down.  I'm sorry if that did not happen in your case.

Here's why:  When the property was built back in the 70's, it was clearly that the rules and regulations back then did not address the parking issue properly.  Our property has 111 guest rooms but only about 85 spaces.  When we first started managing the property I thought: ""which genius designed this place with not enough parking"".  Having said that, we dohave to work around this issue as do many Anaheim hotels.  Everyone has their own solution and ours is to assist the guest to stack park whenever we've reached full capacity.  Granted it's not the best solution when it's midnight, you're tired, your kids are tired, your wife's yelling at you...on and on.  But we've worked out this solution over the years and it's the best we can do to accommodate every guest.  Every guest who stacked parked will be given a permit and the front desk staff will make sure we have the car information.  We'll do our best to make sure by the time you're leaving, the car behind you will already have left.  9 out of 10 times this works out smoothly because we have been very diligent in training our front desk staff.  In fact, I can honestly say if our front desk staff did not pass how to assist guest in parking, they're not going to be working here.  Unless we can buy up a piece of land in the back parking lot and turn it into parking this is the best we'll probably be able to do.
