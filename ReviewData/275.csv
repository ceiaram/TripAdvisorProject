They have great breakfast options and choices for you to choose from which is really a plus since it’s all free.  It could have well been over $20 per person at other high end hotels. The rooms seem really updated and remodeled so it really compares to some luxury star hotels at very discounted price. The staff is excellent and very helpful in places to dine with kids nearby.

We have spoken with Priceline regarding your reservation and per your contractual agreement with them they are unable to do anything since the standard King room is suitable for two people.

As a courtesy we have provided both rooms with a complimentary roll-away bed at no additional cost (normally $10/night).  As we went over during our discussion, it is our priority to make sure that each of our guests are comfortable and satisfied with their accommodations. If that is still not the case with your current reservation we can reduce your reservation and waive any fees.

As you mentioned, our guaranteed check in time does begin at 3 PM.   Unfortunately we are not able to guarantee any early check-ins since the outcome is so dependent on the foot traffic from the previous night. As you may have noticed upon check in, our weekdays are our busiest time of the week and our room attendants need an adequate amount of time to clean rooms that are up to not only our standards, but especially our guests'. We do however understand many of our guests' request for an early check in so we do advise them to contact us prior to arrival so we can update them on the likelihood of accommodating their request. Nonetheless, we apologize for any inconvenience that your son and daughter-in-law may have experienced. Please rest assured that we will be using your feedback to further improve the experience of all of our future guests!   Sincerely,   Jessica Gonzalez",none,none,none,none,none,none,254,275

The breakfast was better than we expected with sausage, hard boiled eggs, a good variety of cereals, waffles, bagels, yogurt, and fruit. The breakfast room was quite small but I understand a remodel is underway. Yes, Beach Blvd. is busy and it is challenging to make a left turn onto Beach but it is just a block to a controlled intersection to the right (south) where you can make a U turn. My only criticism is the bedding. This time of year is cold at night and a down-like comforter rather than a thin blanket would have been nice.
