Room was 1 star but with a 4 star price of $119 plus tax, I checked in and paid then saw the room, bed head was dirty and marked, bed was uncomfortable and room was small. Towels were thin, there was plenty of freeway noise.  I checked out the next day and went down the street to where there was a Hampton Inn and Travelodge for only $10 more.  Avoid this motel unless absolutely no other choice, but there is plenty within a few miles each way.",April 2015,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,490
