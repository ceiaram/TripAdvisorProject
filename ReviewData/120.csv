Has great amenities and is not near Disneyland.  However, Covid has changed everything,  Housekeeping is now only once a week (think about that)! There’s no buffet any longer (cold eggs from steam line now), and now, during reopening, the families are road tripping again.  I don’t begrudge anyone their freedom to enjoy this great country, but have some courtesy for fellow guests. And Homewood management, you must assertively deal with parents who don’t want to supervise their kids.

We appreciate feedback whether it is positive or critical, because that is what makes us better.   I am so sorry you didn't have a great stay and I am embarrassed that you did not receive the great stay you are typically accustom to with us.    I would like to point out that we are currently offering full service cleaning to all of our guests 3 days a week and as soon as the state releases all of their restrictions and Hilton CleanStay standards are loosened, we will go right back to our 7 days option for cleaning.  The reduction to 3 days a week was a combination of over 50% of our guests refusing any cleaning because of wanting to keep anyone person from being in their room and Hilton wanting to minimize human interaction between employees and guests as much as possible while maintaining some sort of high cleanliness standard.  I am sorry you only had your room serviced once, but keep in mind when you come back, you have the option of getting it cleaned up to 3 days a week.  As for the breakfast, I am not sure what happen with the cold eggs as we have not changed how we make or how we keep the eggs and hot dishes warm.  We have the same staff and use the same equipment as we have in the past, so I will be sure to go to the kitchen today and be sure the equipment is working correctly.  Staying in Irvine in June and July is in the middle of what we call our peak season.  It is a busy mix of our usual business travelers and families traveling as schools start to get out.  I do sincerely apologize if there was noise issues.  Hopefully you let our staff know when there was noise so we could deal with is accordingly.  We have a zero tolerance policy and if we warn a guest once and they do not quiet down, we will ask them to leave.  We pride ourselves on making every guest's stay comfortable and obviously this time around, you didn't.  I am so so sorry.  Thank you so much for the comment regarding the mattresses.

We stayed there for a family wedding for 5 nights. We were first greeted by Caroline who was so accommodating. Everyday she was there for everything we needed. Always smiling and joking. She seriously made our stay the best. We were all impressed how on point she was with everything. Seriously she really was the best. When we got home I realized I had left my jewelry in the room when I unpacked 2 days later. When I contacted Myra (spelling??) she put my mind at ease and said she would contact me as soon as they located it.

Nobody warned me ahead of time.  When I inquired at the Front Desk they didn't have an explanation and apologized.

Not close to much other than the airport.  WARNING: if you need a ride to the airport before 0600, make your own arraignments.  The shuttle does not run before 0600 so we asked the front desk to schedule a ride.  They took the room number and time and all, but in the morning the desk attendant just then started trying to line up an Uber.  After 10 minutes of futzing about, we broke out our own phone and called an Uber which took a full 15 minutes to arrive.  The extra 25 minutes added to the anxiety of catching an early flight.  The front desk clerk in the morning had NO CLUE how to call a taxi nor how to do anything other than suggest we call an Uber.",August 2019,none,none,"Greetings, BorregoSailor  Thank you so much for taking the time to leave this review on your recent experience with us. We take each guest review as a chance to better our facilities and guest services. We are pleased to hear that you had a mostly enjoyable stay and are sorry to hear that it was a somber reason that brought you to our location.  Due to our location a little further out from the airport and the hours of operation of John Wayne Airport, we do not offer 24-hour shuttle service. We begin services at 6am when our morning team comes on. We are pleased to offer complimentary Uber rides to the airport when the occasional need arrives. We apologize that the morning you required an Uber ride we were experiencing issues with our internet services, interfering with our desk agents ability to order you an Uber on the hotel's account. We do try and refrain from recommending taxi rides because from our past experiences, they are less reliable and take longer to arrive compared to the ubiquitous Uber drivers. Again, we are sorry that this situation marred an otherwise pleasant experience with us. We will certainly take this situation as a learning opportunity to better set up our night audit staff for future situations like these.  We hope you will join us again the next time you find yourself in Irvine (under better circumstances) so we can provide you with a better experience.

Breakfast was pretty good with a large seating area. Pool was nice, we didn’t use but saw many people enjoying it even in March. The only off thing is when you stood by bathroom sink, it was difficult to get in and out of shower/toilet area.  The person at sink had to move over.  But, with a full fridge, microwave, two stove burners, and dishes it was well worth that bit of discomfort.  Beds super comfortable.",March 2019,none,none,"Greetings, Simon!

The room was lovely and filled with attention to detail (wine opener, glasses, reading lights, movable furniture, ceiling fan, comfy bed, titanium white linens, etc. etc.).  The walk-in shower, albeit a bit low in pressure, was fine.  The breakfast was delightful-- not the usual phone-it-in breakfast offered by other chains.  The all-day coffee and water bar was VERY welcome.  The spa fantastic (the tension in my lower back was temporarily eliminated!).  No-fee parking was nice too.

The rooms are nice and spacious, with full-size kitchen amenities, couch, desk, very nice size flat screen tv and comfortable mattresses.

The beer is on tap and was surprisingly great quality.  The morning breakfast offered eggs, two meat choices, breads, bagels, yogurts, cereal, waffle station, oatmeal and pastries.

We take every review seriously and try to make the best of it and improve whatever feedback we get.  You stayed with us the first weekend of the ""summer"" season which means our busiest time of the year.  Irvine and the surrounding Orange County area has numerous sporting tournaments as well as leisure guests traveling to the surrounding attractions.  We did staff every weekend for the summer to try and avoid the breakfast getting so busy.  I myself was here that weekend and I will agree that the breakfast did get very busy at times.  As with any buffet, we try to control an prepare as best we can.  Hopefully if we did run low on something, it was replaced pretty quick with a smiling and eager team member.  AS for the claim of a ""bloody"" napkin in the room.  I immediately notify the Executive Housekeeper of your claim.  We are sincerely sorry for the napkin being left in the room, which is something we take seriously.  After investigating the substance on the napkin, it was not blood, thank goodness.  But there is still not excuse for the room not being 100% clean and we do sincerely apologize for that as well as the toilet running slowly just after you checked in.

The hotel was in a great location with lots of restaurants nearby in the District.  The room was one of the cleanest I have ever stayed at.  The hotel was bright and with modern interior.  The beds were very comfortable, you literally sank into the bed with the crisp bedding and feather pillows surrounding you.  The height of the bed was great and taller that hotel room beds.  Great breakfast, pleasant interactions with all the hotel staff.  Definitely will stay there again.",February 2017,none,none,"Dear Gay S,  I am so sorry to hear that you missed out on Disneyland.

After receiving your initial communication about the issues, we were quick to check the room and fix any issues.  I also immediately offered you a free future night since you mentioned that your travel to the area 2 to 3 times a year.

The room size was just right, and everything was in working order.  The staff at the front desk was very helpful and friendly.  The only issue we encountered was that they seemed to be severely understaffed in the breakfast room, but that did not hinder my experience, I just felt badly that the one person working seemed to be working so hard.

Th day before we got a call informing us that there was a problem with our room so they were moving us to two connecting rooms with 2 Queen beds in each. No problem, however,  when we arrived we were told that those two rooms were not available so they were moving us to 2 connecting rooms but they only had 1 King bed in each, plus the pull out couch. I was not pleased but honestly it turned out OK. We all slept comfortably and the hotel made it right by knocking off a decent amount off our bill. The hotel itself is very clean and modern!

33 helpful votes,54 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice new hotel,"This is a residence-style suite hotel, with fully equipped kitchens.  No valet or bellhops here; this is a do-it-yourself facility, a plus in my book.  Breakfast is free and the food is a distinct cut above most other similar hotels, served in a beautiful and spacious atrium-style dining room.  On weekday afternoons they also offer complimentary hors d'eourves, which I unfortunately did not get the chance to try.  The hotel is only a month old; Google still shows it as an empty lot!  The staff is extremely friendly.  The hotel is very convenient to John Wayne Airport, UCI, beaches, etc.   Some negatives: 1) This hotel is in a business park area, with no restaurants or stores close by.

It enables me to go back and review things in detail with the team.  Thank you so much for your post.  It is always nice to hear about the staff and amenities being to your expectations.    Thank you for the list of improvements also.  I have taken the liberty of calling out the elevator maintenance company to look at them and see what can be done.  As for the opening of the room at 1030pm, we were able to run a key report straight from your door and in fact it was a team member who was delivering some items to another guest room and mistaken the room number.  I am so so sorry for that.  We have met with the team member and this definitely will not happen again.  Please accept my apology for that and reach out to me if you need any other clarification or questions.  This is certainly an embarrassing situation.
