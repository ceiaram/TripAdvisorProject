1 helpful vote,5 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing stay,"What a fabulous little hotel. They have thought of everything. Coffee service in the morning. Wine in the afternoon. Lavender spray for your pillows. A white noise machine for sleeping. It was so amazing I purchased one on Amazon. Beds and pillows were super comfortable. Gift bag for our dog Clyde upon arrival. However, the biggest selling point for us was the customer service. Kyle went out of his way to make sure our stay was perfect. This is a small hotel only 12 rooms. A large open air atrium in the middle with seating and a rooftop deck with ocean views. It is very Zen like. No TVs in rooms. They do have Wi-Fi to hook up to Netflix if you need to watch a movie. There is so much to see and do in Laguna you really don‚Äôt need a TV. We will definitely return.",June 2022,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,250

Enjoy a morning coffee or a sunset wine on the rooftop patio with gorgeous ocean views. Less than a minute walk and you're on the beach! The location is superb with easy access to fun shops, galleries, wonderful restaurants, and more. The rooms were clean, quiet, and calming.

none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful Petit Boutique in the heart of Laguna,"I loved my stay at SCP - their brand is aligned with my personal values of conservation and wellness, and the size of the hotel, just 12 rooms was great and gave me the feeling of a European B&B. The shared spaces with fireplaces, the offer of a complimentary glass of wine of kombucha each day of my stay, and the service. The team was helpful, kind, and took the time to get to you know the guests, without being invasive. That on top of being able to walk to everything in Laguna made it a perfect fit.",January 2023,none,Traveled on business,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,9,250

4 helpful votes,5 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hotel with a human touch!,"Fantastic location steps from the beach, minimal rooms, great and tranquil design of the courtyard. Meditative sound machine in room, great customer service. The best thing about this hotel is the affordable price and the personal approach at the front desk, exhibited by Kyle and a very nice woman at night, I believe her name begins with ""N"". They really care, and it shows. This hotel reminds me of a quiet Pensione in a small town in Italy. Walkable in seconds to the beach, and a very short walk to the downtown shops. Highly recommend, especially if you, like me, needed a solo retreat to clear your head and rest.",September 2022,none,none,What a blush worthy title for a review!

none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Outstanding experience,We found this hotel on the internet.  Everything you would expect to make a hotel experience great was at this hotel.  What truly set SCP apart was the manager Kyle. My wife and I have traveled extensively and encountered outstanding service. Kyle took service to a new level. He was so good at everything it is hard to explain.  I would say he exceeded all expectations in every way.
