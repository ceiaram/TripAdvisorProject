The staff was very nice. We left before the breakfast opened but they let me into grab a milk and cereal for my kiddo. They also grabbed me a milk the night before. I really appreciated their help as I was traveling with a toddler alone.  If they have a shuttle to Disney I will come back again.

When we arrived to LA we rent a car and drived to Garden Grove area, we made a mistake and we arrived to Holiday Inn at Katella, the Front Desk person was really nice,she offered us a cup of coffee and explained with calm how arrived to the correct hotel.  What a surprise when we arrived to the correct Holiday Inn, the coffee area was a mass, everything was dirty, broken or out off place, the front desk recepcionist was so agressive, the day was so cold, she wouldn´t give us other blanket, my mother got a flu, until the waitress got to clean the room, and found my sick mother there, she help us, with a decent blanket.

4 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Place To Stay!,We booked this hotel because of all the good reviews from Trip Advisor. I must say that most of the reviews were dead on. The hotel staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Check in was quick and easy. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The free breakfast that they offer is small but very good. It is very nice of them to offer this service - especially if you are in a hurry to get to Disneyland in the morning. All amenities were only about a block away. Plenty of food places and even a Target. Disneyland was an easy eight minute drive up the road. My only slight dislike is that the walls are very thin. You can hear conversations going on outside in the parking lot and you can hear the water running in the shower and toilets being flushed in the room next store.

Check in was quick and the staff was helpful. The rooms were very new and clean. The free breakfast was very disappointing. The pastries  and muffins were small and bland. Everything was standard cold breakfast food. We ended up eating out the other mornings. The shuttle that ran to Disneyland only ran  on the half hours.

The location was perfect (just outside of premium area but close enough that it was not a long haul). Staff was friendly and helpful. I don't understand comments about surrounding area being a rough neighborhood. It looked like typical California city center to me. The area was busy but not run down.

It was fine -- mostly clean, relatively new, friendly staff, decent free breakfast. A few minor glitches: For some reason, the microwave and mini-fridge we've enjoyed at other HIE properties was not supplied here. Also, we couldn't get the temperature in the room right, due to the tempermental AC unit -- sometimes too cold, other times too hot, and the fan wouldn't stay on when we wanted it to.

There is high speed internet in the room (not wireless but cable), refrigerator, microwave, etc. I think that holiday inn must have VERY recently bought this hotel and updated everything (furniture, paint, etc.. are all new). The things that I did not like include the lack of a dvd player in the room (I have a 4 year old who likes his disney movies) and that there are only 2 beverage vending machines in the place, one of which has water.

To make a long story short, although they don't run the shuttles that far away anymore, they made an exception and gave us taxi service to and from the airport and shuttle service to and from Knotts, as well as the daily shuttles to Disneyland.

We paid $79.00 a day for our stay and found the hotel to be worth the expense.

I had to take my suitcases everyday to the front desk because I was afraid that the maid stole all my disney souvenirs (if she stole 20 dlls, she could take my daughter princess toys). The shuttle is terrible too!, you sign up for a pickup time and they get there with 1/2 hour delays.
