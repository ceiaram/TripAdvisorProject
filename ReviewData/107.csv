The hotel staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Check in was quick and easy. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The free breakfast that they offer is small but very good. It is very nice of them to offer this service - especially if you are in a hurry to get to Disneyland in the morning. All amenities were only about a block away. Plenty of food places and even a Target. Disneyland was an easy eight minute drive up the road. My only slight dislike is that the walls are very thin.

A few minor glitches: For some reason, the microwave and mini-fridge we've enjoyed at other HIE properties was not supplied here. Also, we couldn't get the temperature in the room right, due to the tempermental AC unit -- sometimes too cold, other times too hot, and the fan wouldn't stay on when we wanted it to.
