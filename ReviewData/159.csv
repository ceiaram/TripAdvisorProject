I came in a day before my daughter and her family arrived at the hotel on Main to talk to them about a reservation that I made in my daughters name for three nights. I had booked the reservation so that the charge would be covered by me. It turned out that only the first night was charged to me and my daughter was billed for two other nights. This was very disappointing. Any business that can't manage their billing is not a company that I wish to frequent.

Part of the family stayed at the AC Marriott and part stayed at the Irvine Marriott. We stayed at Embassy Suites. We liked the two-room suite, but we were less than impressed with other aspects of the stay, some of which can be helped. First, parking was a challenge in that you cannot enter the hotel from the garage. Second, and this has been mentioned in other reviews, there are unsupervised kids everywhere. The pool and exercise rooms are overrun by them, rendering them unusable by adults.

The plus is if you have a lot of kids, the free breakfast would help you save a lot of money.  The parking is a bit cumbersome to park and get to the lobby.  It is also in an enclosed structure but since it is in Irvine, any crime/issue might be super low.  Anyhow, the room was average.  My wife found a hair ball still in the tub so that did not go over well.  The couch in the suite area is a bit dirty.

We arrived early so we were unable to get the City View Suite that we requested and ended up with one that overlooked the garage.  That was a disappointment.

All interaction with hotel staff was great. Everyone was friendly and helpful.  The hotel is located near the airport but I don't remember hearing planes!  My only gripe is the parking. There are a ton of spots outside the garage that say ""20 minute registration parking only"" but they are all taken all day and all night long. When I was checking in I had no place to park! And there was no crowd at the registration desk. My guess is that these people didn't want to pay the $15/day parking and Embassy Suites doesn't enforce the 20 minute rule since all those spots are filled overnight.",August 2014,none,none,"Dear Michael, thank you for your recent stay and taking the time to share your experience.

This property is typical of the usual ES quality.  It was well appointed, had great views and was in an exceptionally convenient and safe area of Irvine.

The food in the restaurant was fair and like most hotels, overpriced.  The French onion soup was wonderful, The Rueben was a good choice, ribs - okay, coleslaw that came with it was wilted and bland. for $4.95 you can get a sparse piece of supermarket cheesecake - don't bother it tastes like the cooler.
