This has never occurred at this location even though any hotel can be targeted, whether it‚Äôs a 3 star or 5 star property.  As with all safety or security incident, we look to first thoroughly investigate the events by having a direct conversation with the people involved, checking the readings from the lock and ensuring that a police report is filed.  In this specific situation, when the hotel team was informed of the incident, the managers started the investigation process immediately gathering more information, contacted the local police department asking for more presence in the area, informed the corporate office of the incident with a corporate team member being dispatched to the property to assist in the investigation and following up with the guests onsite.  Additionally, at our urging, we had one of the occupants file a report with the police department a couple of days after the event in question to ensure all proper steps were taken; until that time, no one from the room had filed a report.  We did not attempt to comment on the situation until we had all the facts.  But after hearing the story from 1 of the occupants, inspecting our lock system and reading the lock logs, it was evident that the room was not accessed using any type of room key.  We could only assume at this point that the room door was left ajar allowing access.  For this reason and overall safety of our guests, we highly suggest that they use the latch lock and the deadbolt which are provided in all the rooms as a necessary precaution.  We, as a hotel team and company, will continue to make safety a priority and look for opportunities to improve our operation and to educate our team and guests on hotel safety and security.

Guests were forced to park on the other side of the freeway in a Motel 6 parking lot with a shuttle to take you back and forth. Of course this type of maintenance needs to be done, but the staff was not at all sympathetic or apologetic about it. The lady who checked me in was completely cold about it. The manager outside was quite belligerent with my boyfriend, who, unaware, had already parked the car. Signs on the lobby door stated that all cars must be off property by10:30 pm and it was only 6 or 6:30. This man insisted that we could not unload the car and move our luggage to our room. We must follow the shuttle driver, transfer out luggage to his van, then bring it all back to the hotel.

The room was marginal at best. The bathroom and bathtub were chipped, spotty, not well cleaned. Walls were stained and dirty throughout. Overall, the entire place is in serious need of an overhaul. The beds were like being on a waterbed but some like that I am sure. I never saw a no smoking sign and smoke certainly wafted to our 3rd story room. The breakfast was the standard breakfast that most of these places have. However, there was no coffee until we asked someone to replace the empty container. The remainder of the ""breakfast"" was the usual cardboardy, mass produced fare. That is to be expected and not unusual but seemed just a bit worse here.

I read some of the reviews after the stay and this place needs way more than updating. The stay began with coming back from dinner and having someone doing drugs in one corner of the back parking lot and someone else urinating in another. The gentlemen urinating in the parking lot got in his white van after we exited our car and watched us very closely until we were out of site. Im not 100% sure of what happened after that, but my husband went outside to get something he left in the car and low and behold someone had hit the back of my car and the paint on it was...what...white.

I couldn't afford to stay at that one any longer so I was lucky enough to find the Comfort Inn. I had a room right at the pool and hot tub at about half the price. Now I must say the breakfast wasn't the greatest especially after a hundred days of it but it was just a short walk to many other places. I even walked to the Holiday Inn for breakfast.
