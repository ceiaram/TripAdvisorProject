I actually choose to stay here since I was attending a concert at the Honda center which is less than 3 miles away from Hotel Lulu. As soon as I arrived I was greeted and check in by Adan.  The check in process was super easy. They even gave us complementary drinks. The room was super cozy and comfortable. We were able to keep our drinks cold in the fridge with no problem.

It blew cold air, but the vents were pointed up so the rest of the room couldn't cool down. Between the upstairs neighbors, toilets flushing, people next door, and housekeeping, sleep was nearly impossible which made it hard to get rest after a long day at Disney and having to travel the next day.
