Could do with a lick of paint or a little upgrading.  But tv, microwave and fridge all included and the sink area is very nice.",July 2019,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,412
2 helpful votes,6 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Shady business practice - they cancelled our room without calling!,"Avoid this place at all costs, even if you see a good deal on an online booking site. We booked a room at a great rate through Hotels.com, but apparently it was too good of a deal because the hotel unilaterally cancelled our room and re-rented it to someone else. Upon check in at 3:30 p.m., they stated that there was a problem with the credit card and they had cancelled our room. Even if they were right, how about a phone call??? I have had that card for years, so there should not have been a problem. But in any event, who just cancels without calling the customer? To make matters worse, the check in clerk was completely unapologetic and rude. He was literally shooing my boyfriend away with his hand, like I don't have time for this, I've cancelled your room, why are you still",July 2018,none,Traveled as a couple,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,2,412

This is an old style motel (drive right up to your door though parking is limited near doors but also available in the back of the property). Nice local host who helped us get to our room. There are no extras here (no ice machine, vending, breakfast, etc.) The rooms are fine -- stripped of old dusty carpets and drapes to make them a bit more modern and equipped with new tvs, mini fridges and microwaves. Internet was fine, but water was luke-warm in the shower. There is significant traffic noise and the well lit parking lot spills through the blinds so not the most conducive for a",September 2017,Get the rooms farthest from the road,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,412

The motel is newly renovated and the room was functional. The A/C was a bit difficult to regulate. I ended up turning it off during the night, which made the room a bit stuffy in the morning.",July 2017,none,Traveled on business,none,2.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,412
