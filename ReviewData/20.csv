2 helpful votes,4 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointed,The hotel is located well in the Disneyland area.  The front desk staff are less than the nicest or helpful staff I’ve encountered on my travels either.  The interior of the hotel is dated. Rooms are spacious enough but you have to ask for the room to be serviced.  This is not explained at check in an when we asked the second day it was apparently a chore for the front desk staff to arrange it and they never did come.  I wouldn’t stay here again.  You pay a premium due to the area but there are much better hotels on the strip around the same price point.

The bedrooms are totally separate and can be closed off from both the bathroom and the living room.

The next day my receipt showed a full nights parking charge. I called & let them know I did not have a car & we were dropped off.

Pros -   - Staff is very friendly, welcoming and eager to help.    - Grounds are very attractive and well kept  - Rooms are spacious  - Hotel is way quieter than other properties I've stayed at during the same show  - Restaurant is normally available without reservations and food is above average. Cons  - Rooms are getting a bit dated and need work.  Furniture hasn't changed since I first stayed at this hotel most likely over 10 years ago.  It's due for a refresh   - For a major chain like the Hilton (even for a sub brand) the gym is VERY disappointing.  One treadmill, one bike and some weights.

The room was clean, spacious.  For me another minus was not having a mirror close to a plug that wasn't in the bathroom.  it meant that whilst my husband was showering I couldn't blow dry my hair and when he was finished the bathroom was very warm to blow dry my hair.

I'm a Hilton Gold member and was glad about the free breakfast, although I have to say that the hotel options for vegans are really lacking. I was stranded into just eating fruit and bagels with jelly, and given that Anaheim is pretty vegan-friendly, I believe that a Hilton hotel should be doing better. Some ideas for good vegan breakfast options would be a tofu scramble, veggie sausages, non-dairy butter, non-dairy cream cheese, or pancakes without animal products.

But the hotel itself needs some major renovation the room we had 708 was clean but looked old at the same time, All the furniture looked like it had come from the 70s era. Also the one thing that needs changing is the cafe it closes just after lunch so if you need a Starbucks coffee it’s a 10 minute walk to the Hilton Hotel at the convention centre.

A pass for the bus was purchased at the front desk for $5.50 which was good all day. Disneyland is a walkable distance from the hotel but being an avid Walt Disney World traveler, I knew I needed my steps for park exploration and used the bus instead.

The main reasons for this hotel was that we got a deal with a suite, so we had a bedroom & separate living room. Which gave us (2 adults & 2 kiddies) space. There is a heated outdoor pool & jacuzzi.

You can walk to the park, will take 20 minutes. On a long day, hitch a ride. Many restaurants are with in walking distance and next to the Double Tree.

I could not have picked a worse hotel for business. Firstly, like most business travellers I need Wi-Fi access. I thought a Convention Center will have good Wi-Fi.

I can see by your wording that this stay was bitterly disappointing to you. Please note your feedback was reviewed with the entire team for follow up. In addition, the hotel has been in contact with both Hilton and AT&T to see if any improvements can be made to the wifi.   Your email concerns were addressed within 72 hours of receipt. I have included our GM's response to you below: ""I am very sorry to hear of the problems you experienced with the Wi-Fi at our Hotel. I must say you are the first person to complain about the quality of the internet. The complaints we get are for people having problems logging into the system, not from those actually using it. We also offer hard wire service in all guest rooms for free so I am not sure if that may have worked better for you for conducting business. While the internet is free to everyone at our Hotel I would expect it to be a the level you have come to expect at all Hilton Hotels. I have asked AT&T to have one of their technicians come and look into the connection for room 723 to see if they can find out what the problem may be.   We strive to be the best DoubleTree in customer service so again it is very surprising to hear about the way you were treated at the Front Desk. I have discussed the content of your emails with the Director of Front Office and she will be bringing those to the attention of her whole staff at their next meeting.   Our Hotel only provides the two bottles of water at check in as required by Hilton HHonors standards. I believe if you had asked the Room Attendant or at the Front Desk they would have given you some additional waters seeing that you are a Gold HHonors member, as we do not supply them daily as procedure.  Again, I apologize for the issues you encountered and I assure you that I will discuss these issues with my staff to see what can be done going forward to prevent another guest from experiencing the same.""

Please accept my apologies for any disappointment you felt.  I have some additional information which may help clarify how we handle credit cards.  When guests check in to the hotel, the full amount of their stay and a $50 incidental deposit per night is authorized on the credit card provided.  This authorization often shows as a ""pending transaction"" when you look at the account online.    When you depart, the final amount is charged against that same authorization.  Once that charge is processed, the authorization then drops off of your account.  The speed with which the authorization is released depends on the credit card company.  As a result, the authorization and the final charge may briefly overlap.  I apologize for our failure to explain the credit card process clearly and for the disappointing guest service you received.  I am also very surprised to hear you were disappointed in the Housekeeping services.  Your comments will be shared with the team as part of our ongoing guest service training.

I realize that I made a good choice choosing this one.  Although it´s not so close to the Disney Parks (1 mile), you can try walk or go by shuttle or by car (what I think it´s better). You have to pay the parking in this hotel (USD 16) but you will have a Hilton Hotel with silence, good shower, towels and sheets with good quality. Even the restaurant has a good price if you are with kids because under 12 years they don´t pay if they are with adults.

The cookies were fantastic and the staff was amazing to supply my kids with cookies each time we entered the hotel. My only complaint is: no shuttle to Disneyland which is about 1 mile away. Be prepared to walk, we thought it wouldn't be a big deal (we exercise a lot), but it turned out to be with 3 kids. Also parking was $22 a night. I wouldn't mind the $22 if they had a shuttle to Disneyland. The hotel and rooms were always clean and quiet. Staff are very friendly. Great place to stay if you don't mind walking or there for a convention (convention center was close by). We go to Disneyland every year and this would be our ""go to"" hotel if it had a shuttle.

I'm glad your family had a good visit & enjoyed our famous cookies.  While the Disneyland Resort is close by, it can be a long walk after a full day in the parks.  I must admit I’m disappointed that you didn’t hear about the Anaheim Resort Transit system during your stay.  The ART is a shuttle system for Disneyland & the greater Anaheim Resort area.  The ART service typically begins one hour prior to the opening of the Disneyland Resort & picks up approximately every 20 minutes. The ART stop is located at the end of the hotel's driveway, facing Harbor Blvd.  Guests can purchase passes at our hotel's front desk.  Adults aged 10 & up are $5 round trip.  Kids aged 3-9 are $3 round trip.  The ART is a great service & I apologize you weren’t informed about it during your visit.  I’d also like to clarify that overnight parking is $16 per car, per night.  I was concerned when I saw the $22 price you mentioned but when I checked your receipt, I saw that you were charged the correct amount.  Benjamin, I hope you consider staying with us in future.  I think the ART shuttle might be the missing piece to a great stay for you & your family.

On the morning of your scheduled check out, you room attendant found your room vacant, with the exception of two balloons.  It is very common for hotel guests to leave balloons behind in their rooms when they depart, as they do not make good travel companions.  The balloons were removed & the room was cleaned.  After finishing your room, the attendant gave one of the balloons to a child she encountered.    When the room attendant was advised that the balloons were not intended for the trash, she felt awful.  It’s my understanding you were compensated $8 for your lost balloon.

Proximity to the Disney options is good - nearly a mile, although you can take a bus, and the dining options for families are good but not fabulous if you are seeking fine dining, albeit being reasonably priced.

The two TV's were a bonus; * A fridge and microwave in the room; * A guest laundry; * Heated pool and spa (we were lucky enough to have a couple of days which were warm enough to swim; * Starbucks coffee on-site; and * Internet access in the business centre for keeping in touch.

I called down to the front desk to extend my stay and the man at the front desk said, ""we are all sold out"". There was no help what so ever, come to find out there was rooms available. I found the front desk staff very unprofessional, rude and unhelpful, other than that, the room was very nice.  If you don't care about service, then you will be happy. If you care about being treated kindly and professionally, then stay somewhere else.",June 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2921,20

We are annual passholders and stay in Anaheim once a month for a Disney trip.  We have stayed at many many area hotels including the Grand Californian, Disneyland Hotel, Ho Jo's, Del Sol, Candy Cane Inn, etc.  Honestly, the Doubletree has the best room we have ever stayed in.  The ""mini-suites"" were perfect for us.  Our son slept on a pull-out couch in the front room.  We had a seperate room with a ""sweet-dreams"" bed.  IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP.  The beds and pillows really are great.  Ultra clean room with a good size bath,  2 TV's and a microwave.  Large fluffy bath towels.  Staff extremely nice.  And yes, warm cookies at check-in.  The location was the only drawback.  It really is a bit too far to walk considering",June 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2922,20
17 helpful votes,18 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Loved it!!,This was our second Hotel of the trip out of 5 different hotels. I loved this hotel. It was so clean and comfortable. The staff was very nice and helpful.  The beds and pillows in this hotel were so comfortable I felt like I was at home. We are very picky about staying in clean hotels and this surpassed our expectaions. We will stay here again if we ever go back to Anaheim.,June 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2923,20
55 helpful votes,38 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Loved this place!,"Stayed here May 26 - 28, 2006.  I booked a 2 Queen/2 Room Suite for 4 of us and it was very spacious, the beds were the Sweet Dreams beds and very, very comfortable to sleep in; we loved their beds!!  Of course, when you check-in, you get their famous chocolate chip cookies, nice and warm.  Everything from check-in to, maid serviced, to room service was exceptional.   We had no complaints other than having to leave.  The hotel is only minutes from Disneyland and the Disney Shuttle stops in front of the hotel every 20 minutes.  There is a Denny's and Carls Jr right across the street and several other eateries all around the area.  If you need a rental car, there are several in the area.  If you're looking for bargain shopping, go to the Anaheim Market, just minutes away also.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2924,20

Excellent service, great pool.  All of the rooms with 2 queen beds are suites with a separate living room.  Excellent for a family with small children.  We walked to Disney two of the days and took the ART the other times.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone doing Disney.  Very comfortable beds.  Extremely clean!!",May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2925,20
26 helpful votes,23 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,absolutely LOVED it!,"I just returned from a four day stay at this hotel. because I was in town for a business conference. It was awesome! the place is lovely to look at and to stay in. the lobby is simply beautiful and everything from the floral centerpiece, cozy couches, shiny floors, beautiful ceilings and warm rich colors in the lobby scream ""Elegance"". The staff are friendly, attentive, professionally dressed and helpful. They even gave us a warm cookie after we checked in as a welcome. :)   The room we had held double queen sized beds and looked like a small one bedroom apartment complete with living room area and ample storage areas. The style of furnishings were modern, clean and new and  the colors used are attractive and restful. The view from the window was great too, we were on the 6th",May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2926,20
12 helpful votes,11 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great New Hotel,"I loved the hotel. Excellent service. Rooms were quite comfortable. The 2 room suite had just the right amount of closet and storage space. The minifridge (no freezer) had enough space to store the weeks worth of food (it was a size larger than the cube type). The microwave was easy to use.  Small pool. 2 washers/dryers located on 4th floor.  Internet service was good - $9.95/day or $49.95/week. (Free wireless in lobby)  My primary complaint was the hotel uses the ART shuttle service which (for me) has always been more than unreliable.  It took 7 minutes to walk to Convention Center.  For a COnvention Center trip, I would not hesitate to stay there again. For a primary Disney trip I will stay there for a really excellent rate only.",May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2927,20
7 helpful votes,18 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice Hotel Near Convention Ctr & Disneyland,Stayed here while at conference at Convention Center which is just down the block and around the corner.  Very new and nice.  Room was spacious and nice.  Ask for room in rear of hotel to be away from traffic noise on Harbor Blvd.  Restaurant was good for breakfast but service can be slow.  No wireless internet except for in lobby and they charge $10/day for this with cable in room. Great location with pick up right out front for trolley to Disneyland parks.  Very nice and quiet since it's new and not a lot know about it.  Much better than Hilton/Marriott and rate was cheaper.,May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2928,20
54 helpful votes,38 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Quick Walk to Disney,"I agree with most of the reviews posted (beautiful albeit small suites, nice decor, wonderful bed).  I will only add a few things:  Disney is a quick 20-minute walk.  My husband and I stayed with our two young boys (3 and 1).  We just popped them in the stroller each morning and walked to Disney.  It was much easier than the day we took the ART (waiting, folding and unfolding stroller).  My husband thinks we beat the bus easily each day we walked.  The pool was a bit of a disappointment.  It is just a basic pool (no frills).  I was expecting something a little larger, but it was fine.  The service left something to be desired.  No one was rude, but they did not know the answer to some of my questions and did not go out of their way to find out.    Great price/value!",April 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2929,20
21 helpful votes,10 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful rooms,My family of four stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites for 3 days last week.  The room decor is very upscale. Our room had 2 queen beds and a sofa sleeper in the living room which is always great when my two sons don't have to share a bed.  As mentioned in another review the hotel is brand new. If you have any hyper-sensitivity to fumes from new carpets and furniture you might want to wait a month. Great location too.,April 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2930,20
