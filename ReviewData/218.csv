Our room, while clean, suffers from overuse; ripped screens outside + broken towel bar inside (which the owner decided to fix while we were unpacking). Everything in the room needs replacing. The furniture is old + worn. Absolutely NO amenities for our price of $165/night (Dbl Queen). It was quiet at night despite facing PCH. Will look for other accommodations during our next stay in OC.

30 helpful votes,29 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,It was ok,"I had booked a room here through AirBnB. I'll start with the PROS of my 3 night stay: The motel room was clean, had a TV, very good WiFi, a small one-cup motel-style coffee machine, a fridge, microwave, and hair dryer. The king bed was comfortable. It was a 5 min walk (one block) to the beach. I saw that you can borrow beach chairs and beach towels from the motel. There are 2-3 restaurants, a small grocery store, and 2 cafés in immediate walking distance. Not much else around in terms of sights. It's a 40 min walk to Newport Beach pier. It's definitely walking/bicycle friendly. The CONS: I'm a noise-sensitive person. The walls were very thin and you could hear the other guests throughout the night.

I was in the big room with my daughters for their spring break this year and I couldn’t have asked for better service. Check in was simple and easy The rooms are totally accommodating for family trips and I’d imagine others for solo. But our stay was fantastic, we had the big room right next to the sun deck and the ocean is about a 700 ft walk (if that really)! Great place to stay happy they’re still open during covid.

We are trying to figure out why we are suddenly having a couple of “firm” or “hard” comments about our beds after years of wonderful feedback from Guests regarding how comfortable our beds are.  Our Serta reps are also at a loss to explain as our beds are from the upper end of their line typically installed in higher-end expensive properties.  We are now experimenting with different “bed toppers” to see if we can create a more luxurious feel without compromising the support that many Guests prefer.

The location was close to the beach but the surrounding area was pretty rough and except for Cappy's resturant there wasn't much around.  If I had to do it over I would have paid more and stayed in a better location and hotel.  The reviews on here sounded good with a couple of exceptions.  I should have checked on things a little more.,January 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,349,218
14 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Place,"The Newport Channel Inn is a nice little hotel just a short walk to the beach.  It's next door to Cappy's, a great breakfast place and just a short drive to UC Irvine & Fashion Island.  The managers are very friendly and the place was immaculately clean.  I last stayed here about 10 years ago and the place has been well kept up with new furniture and a quiet heating and cooling system.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,350,218

The staff was friendly and helpful. Accommodations were roomy and clean. The location is very close to the beach, and a short drive from the hustle and bustle of Newport Harbor, Balboa Island, and Fashion Island shopping.  Our out-of town guests are looking forward to coming again for another stay.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,352,218

3 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Horrible!!!!,"Do not believe any online info you obtain on this ""Motel.""   It was not worth the $81.00 we paid for.  (2adult, king, 1st floor) The place was old.  They need to gut the whole place and renovate it with new furniture.  The bathroom was too small and the sink/coffemaker was out of place.  The microwave/refrig combo was on a piece of furniture that looks like it was used for a computer.  It looks like the place hasn't been renovated since the 70's.  It smelled very musty and overall it was not a good deal.  And if you think you are going to get a good nights sleep, well, think again.  Especially with the traffic on W. Coast Hwy and your neighbors, we heard everything, and I mean everything.  Good luck.... PS, do not use this ""Motel"" to set up any guest for any type of function,",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,354,218
13 helpful votes,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,very nice,"This motel is a very nice, clean and pleasant. The office staff is very knowledgeable and accomadating to all our requests. THis is right across from the beach, next to some great restaurants and 5 minutes from the pier where you board the Catalina Flyer to the island of Catalina.   In addition, they sell attraction tickets and Catalina Flyer tickets at discounted prices.   Very reasonable rates for California. Highly recommend you stay here.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,355,218
17 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Used to dislike the beach until our stay at Newport Channel Inn,"How do I begin? From the first phone call to your establishment, we were treated with nothing but respect and professionalism! The General Manager, Brion, was GREAT! Very knowledgable,of the area, and had no problems expalining everything thing there was to do during our stay.  He even went so far as to get us in at The Rusty Pelican on a Saturday night...and you know how busy that night can be. We are so please and excited, we are coming back again this Saturday night and staying until Monday! We have even decided to see a realtor about a posssible move to Newport or near by area. And yes, Brion hadid have something to do with this decision! Strange but true! We have even invited family and friends and told them to look no further than The Newport Channel Inn!  Thank you Brion",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,356,218
