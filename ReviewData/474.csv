8 helpful votes,10 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Owners Are Not Responsive To Park's Disruptive Inconveniences,"We are experienced motorhomers who have travelled to many parks and locations throughout the years.  We live locally and wanted to stay at this park due to some remodel work being done in our residence.  Our 11 day stay was not a pleasant experience.  We wrote the owners of the park an email describing our haphazard and frustrating stay that they were clearly responsible for, but did not care enough about their guest's experience at their park, nor were professional enough to respond.  Taking our money was a priority, though.    This is the actual email:  Dear Sir(s):   My name is XXXX XXXX and have been a guest at your rv facility since September 12, 2022 and am reserved until September 23rd. Since my arrival 3 days ago, two of those days we have been without water until",September 2022,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,474

It is located directly across the street from the beach and can walk to beach in a matter of minutes. There is controlled crosswalk adjacent to park.  The place is very clean; pool, hot tub and rec room. They have quiet time that everyone follows and even during the day it is fairly quiet especially during the week. We have stayed here many times and highly recommend the park.

46 helpful votes,26 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Tight spaces, but close to the beach...not the best deal in HB","As others have stated, it's a parking lot. Spaces do not have picnic tables, grass, or anything extra and you can reach out and touch your neighbors.No campfires or charcoal BBQs are allowed in the park. However, the location is great if you're here for the beach. (There are fire pits at the beach across the street). A trip to the beach does require quite a bit of walking and crossing Pacific Coast Hwy., which is very busy. Would be nerve wracking to do this with young children. We liked the pool and hot tub, which were clean and well-maintained. Lots of shopping nearby, but too far to walk if you're picking up groceries. It was such a hassle trying to park in our tiny space that we chose to take a Lyft to go to the store (cost about $6.00 each way).",June 2019,"Measure your RV length before booking.

Guest relations were nice but the place requires so much work, and has some long term residents living there.  My family enjoyed the pool and hot tub.  Unfortanetly it was noisey all night from the road, nearby refinery and/ or construction.

Easy access to the beach across the street.  Person at the front was not overly friendly but I was not looking for a friend. But at the prices you pay, I would have liked someone to go a bit out of their way to at least smile.  I thought check in was 12:00 but no it’s 1:00. My mistake, the front desk person told me to go and look if they were still there, if yes you’ll have to come back.  Wow, wrong business to be in!

43 helpful votes,80 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great Location, If you look West","This park is really a paved parking lot.  Not a tree in the place.  There is zero privacy between spaces.  However, the beach is literally across the PCH and access is very easy.  The bike path goes north to the Pier and south to Newport and both are really close.  The park is next to a power plant and a mobile home park.   Pros  Easy access to the beach.  Close to the Pier and shopping and dining.  Good wifi (actually could stream Netflix).  Cable TV was high definition on all channels.  Game room was nice with pool table, ping pong and football.  All free.  The residents we met were nice and helpful.  Cons  Bathrooms and showers need some work.  They were clean, but a little beat up.  Park need some maintenance.

4 helpful votes,15 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointing.......,"This site was pre-booked for one night before leaving the UK so had no real idea of the site. On arrival was quite disappointing..... best described as a tarmac car park with water taps, hook ups and drains. Thankfully not very busy as the pitches were all quite small and close together. The whole site looked a little tired and in need of a spruce up. The facilities were at best basic and in parts not particularly clean. It is close to a beach but we couldn't comment on that as the strong wind whipped up a sand storm. There is a very busy road between the RV park and the beach which at night was noisy and intrusive. If your main interest is a beach and little else then maybe this site might be for you however it was not our choice.",April 2017,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,11,474

I am glad to report that this place is great. First of all there are not many RV Parks with full service in this area, like none! The park is small, getting in and out tested my ability to back my 34' fifth wheel, but it all worked out great. Checking in was quick and easy, the people in the office were very nice. The restrooms were clean the few times I used them. It appeared that some people were staying for several weeks/months at this park but the park was clean and organized. If I could stay there for a month I might too!

I knew about this place from growing up in HB area but never wanted to stay there because of the power plant. We decided to take a chance and went in with zero expectations.  We were pleasantly surprised by the pool and the friendly fellow campers, but the best part is bicycle access and the beach across the street.

54 helpful votes,126 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Okay For A Night or Two,"First impression: I walked into the office to check in and waited about 5 minutes while the clerk was on the phone. I wasn't even acknowledged. Finally a gentleman came out to assist. Spaces were wide enough for our 38' RV and to also park our car next to the RV. Maneuvering into spaces was tight. Had to take off tow car to drive to space due to tight cornering. We had a space along the PC Hwy wall and if cars would have been parked in the parking area in front of our space we could not maneuver backing into the space.  Lot of full time residence in park with older trailers and RVs and lots of junky rigs and junk around their area.

1 helpful vote,4 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Convenient location, decent amenities","We only stayed two nights on a long road trip out west. We chose this place for the location alone, and it was a great spot right across from the beach. Downtown HB was a little over a mile, and we had spent an exhausting day at the beach, so we did take an Uber lift there and back, but it was absolutely walking distance for the less lazy. :)  We were there during some big surfing event, so the main beach was really crowded, but our area right across from the park was still nice.   The park itself had a nice pool and hot tub area, but we didn't use them when there was a great beach right across the road.  The bathroom facilities were good, but the water didn't get warm (I have teenage girls, it was an issue).

Unfortunately there weren't any reviews... so we took a chance.  Its basically a parking lot with very little room for turning & backing in (which is required for all spots). There is no shade at all and no picnic tables etc. The pool area was nice enough, as was the game room, but the cigarette smoke in these areas was so strong we didn't use them much. This meant no Wifi since it was only available there. The bathrooms were clean, but the showers left much to be desired. The women's had 5 but one was out of order, one wouldn't drain and one barely misted out. That left 2 workable showers and one of those had a door that wouldn't close.
