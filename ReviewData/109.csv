I stay at Hiltons all the time, and this might be the worst one yet. The property itself is very dated, but in pretty typical DoubleTree style. Be aware the 2-bed rooms are doubles not queens. No elite recognition at check-in, and annoying $23 parking charge considering the hotel is in the middle of nowhere and the lot is uncovered.  My real issue has to do with the refusal to honor elite breakfast benefit. As a Diamond, I am entitled to 2 buffet breakfasts per day. The buffet was understandably closed due to covid restrictions, so I had called in advance to find out what the breakfast would be, and was told I would get 2*$15 credits to use on the restaurant menu to-go.

70 helpful votes,71 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Stay - Great Location,"Stayed at Doubletree while on a family trip to Disneyland. The crazy thing is that there are two Doubletree hotels and we thought we were staying at the other hotel so we could walk to Disney. Here is the thing, we preferred this hotel as it had an hourly transfer to Disney (drop off and pick up) just ask for a timetable and this hotel didn't come with all of the crowds that prefer to be closer to Disney.   As an added bonus, if you have the stamina there is an outlet shopping centre virtually next door to the hotel so you can do some great shopping also.   The staff here were all super friendly and the bus driver was great with the kids. I'm really glad we stayed at this hotel.

I have spent 13 nights total in 4 different hotels this month alone so I travel a lot on business and experience many different hotels in various countries around the world. This hotel is aged, but clean and in a good location. For the price I booked at, I sincerely expected a top notch hotel. The breakfast was  extremely underwhelming with the only positive being that there was in fact food available. One can get an omelette cooked hot for you, but this is about the best it gets. Several of my colleagues also stayed here and we all agreed that for the price we payed, our expectations were not met.

We stayed here on our trip to Disneyland and chose this location due to proximity to the park and ratings. When we got there, it had stormed earlier and was very humid outside. Unfortunately, the room was the exact same. I brought the AC down as low as it would go and it did absolutely nothing. Our bed sheets felt like a wet plastic shower curtain and needless to say, I only got about 2 hours of sleep because I was so uncomfortable. We left early the next morning to catch the FREE shuttle to Disney (the only good thing about this hotel) and so we were unable to talk to anyone at the time.

I choose this property because it is not far from Disneyland and their prices are generally cheaper than closer properties to the Disney resort.  I paid about $300 for 3 nights which is very decent. Upon arrival, a very friendly clerk checked me in in no time. As a HHonors member, I had a room on one of the HHonors floors and free wi-fi, which is nice. The hotel caters for big groups and it feels like a big complex in the middle of nothing much. The rooms are a bit dated and the whole decor is anonymous and cold. The fitness room was small but decent. The concierge was rather friendly. The staff running the shuttles back and forth from Disneyland (about 1 shuttle per hour) was great:  always enthusiatic and kind.

93 helpful votes,75 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Hotel nice but far from Disney,"Overall - OK.  Hotel is FAR from Disneyland and all the best restaurants in town. Oh yeah, this hotel isn't even in Anaheim, it's in Orange. Yes, the hotel has a Disneyland shuttle but it only runs on the hour. Maybe that's fine for weekdays and off season but it should run every 30 on summer weekends. I missed it everyday and had to drive (annual pass with free parking - otherwise I would've waited.)  Hotel is close to UC Irvine, a massive church and some outlets.

We have always stayed at the Embassy Suites on our previous visits but decided to give this hotel a try.  It seemed updated and the rooms looked nice online.  Our stay was average and we spent the entire trip wishing we were staying at the Embassy Suites for the following reasons.   1) The rooms here are very tiny and we were very tight for a family of 5.  There was not enough room to place our suitecases or store our clothes, stroller etc.  2) Breakfast is included at Embassy Suites and if you are not a frequent business traveler at the Doubletree breakfast is very expensive. 3) The room was very warm when we arrived and it took 3 phone calls for someone to bring us toothpaste and an extra blanket.

The only good thing about the hotel was the Troffi restaurant which served good food. There's a Wendy's and a Starbucks across the road if needed a cheaper breakfast option. Shuttle service is poor - one shuttle in an hour so if the shuttle is full you have to wait for an hour for the next one or take a taxi. Similarly the first return shuttle starts at 2:15 PM - if you want to start early then also you can't do that. The drop off area is way outside where as almost all other shuttles drop at a better location.
