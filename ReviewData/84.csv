25 helpful votes,54 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wished we could have stayed longer.,"Out of the bag, I’ll start out by saying that we visited Anaheim purely for Disneyland. Saying that, I couldn’t afford the cost of Disney’s own resorts, so I google earthed the hotels that were in walking distance. Which it is, about 3min to the gates of Disneyland & California Adventure. Incidentally, a McD’s is halfway down. Perfect placement for a quick something before or after the park. My draw to this hotel was the pool and waterslides it offers, having 4 kids it was perfect. Google earth wise, it looked good. In reality, it was flipping awesome! In house restaurant, lounge, and store. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The pool has life guards on roster (not that I’d let mine swim alone anyway) And was a genuinely relaxing place to unwind after the parks.",October 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,35,84

They had great reviews, were reasonably priced and I’ve stayed at a few Courtyards before so I booked it. Best decision I made! The staff was great!

It's really close to the park, I was able to power walk from my door to the gates of the park in 12 minutes. Regular pace would be 18-20 minutes. Another option as pointed out by a previous reviewer is to walk across the street to the Disney Toy Story Lot and take their shuttles. I found out it wasn't worth doing as it took just as longer or even longer.  The room of the hotel was good condition as you would expect of a courtyard. I was granted late check out by an hour which was nice. Also the bistro gave me a banana for free which was nice.

For those who frequent the Marriott chain, this Courtyard is new with updated furnishings and bathrooms ( the bathrooms are very large). The staff is very nice and helpful.

This is Marriott's newest hotel in the area, and I was amazed how clean it was even after one year of being open.  The rooms are nicely decorated, and just right in size for a family of four.  Some people have complained about size, but let's face it are you really at Disneyland to stay in your room?  The staff was very friendly and helpful, even helping to arrange medical care for my wife who became ill during our trip.  The pool was nice sized, and heated just right.

The hotel offered a shuttle for $3 per adult from their nearby Marriott, which was a bit of a hike and ended up being more expensive than the taxis.
