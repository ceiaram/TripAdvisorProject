The mattress on the bed was comfortable, although the pillows were all the same firmness - hard.  I would suggest that out of the 4 they provide they include one or 2 that are less firm. I did not use the pool as the outdoor temps rarely got above 72. There is a small pool, but I didn't use it as the temps were too cool while I was there.

This little gem has cathedral ceilings in the single floor rooms, which made the good sized space seem even larger. It has nice decor, some of the furniture shows a bit of wear, but not enough to want to pay double or more at some of the other hotels on the street. There are several eateries within 3 minutes of walking. Some of the other hotels charge a parking fee, not this one. Jay, the desk man, really was the topping on cake.

11 helpful votes,10 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Here  we go again,I’ve been coming to Anaheim for the past 20 years or so to a big Music Exhibition (NAMM Show) After the general price increase I stopped using the official hotel at the so-called corporate rates and was looking for something more sensible price-wise.   This place is just opposite Disneyland and a block away from the rear entrance to the Conference centre. It was taken over by a young Indian family just few years ago and every year I can see the great improvements. The owner is really caring for his property and year-by-year it is getting better - still for the some rates (so far:) As I’ve already written in the previous review - If you do not need to stay in Hilton to be happy so this place is definitely for you.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Not A Single Good Night's Rest,This is a budget motel near the Disney Resort that is not at all a bargain if you wish to sleep at night. The room is quiet but the bed was only slightly more comfortable than the floor. Both my spouse and I are side-sleepers who woke up stiff and sore each morning--after horrible nights tossing. We chose this property strictly due to previous reviews. We liked the free parking and didn't need amenities like free breakfast. The barebones approach did not pay off as Anaheim Discovery Inn & Suites may be the worst place to (attempt to) sleep near Disneyland.,December 2017,none,none,"Dear Cynthia, We were so disappointed that we failed to provide you and your husband with a restful nights sleep.
