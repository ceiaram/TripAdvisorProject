The rooms are quite large (we got the suite - two queens in one room and pull out sofa in the other). I would say the rooms are older, but very clean. Plenty of towels. The pillows leave much to be desired as does the free breakfast (individual breakfast pastries, coffee, cereal, and bread - there was fruit the last two days of our stay - bananas and apples I think). Overall you can't beat the price or the distance to Disneyland. It was super easy to walk back to the room to nap/relax in the afternoon. The pool/hot tub are nothing fancy, but clean (indoors).

Especially for the price.  The breakfast is ok, with Danish, fresh fruit, boiled eggs, toast, bagels, cold cereals, juice and coffee. Leaves little tip be desired for a continental breakfast but with waffle stations being the basic breakfast offering in motor lodges and motels all over, it is surprising you don't offer this. Another negative is the main elevator... Slower then molasses and Forrest Gump.  The staff are great. Every last one o of them.

It was an easy walk back to the hotel late in the evening when we left the park for the day.   We had a standard double room, which had two beds, a small table and two chairs, microwave, and fridge.

I gave a 4 rating because it was exactly a 5 minute walk from the hotel to the main gates at Disneyland and California Adventure AND check-in/out was a breeze.   The room and amentities were nothing special ... this pick was all about location. We stayed at another hotel that said it was walking distance from Disneyland two years ago and it was a much nicer hotel but “walking distance” was a joke ... it was close to 2 miles!!

The room we had was outdated; the bathroom was incredibly small and dirty; the beds were not comfortable; and to top it off during the night the part of the trim on the window came off.

In this case though, I did end up lucking out.  The location of the hotel (as most will know) is excellent for access to the Disneyland Resort.  Based on past stays down here and using the ART system, even though we may have walked a little more, it saved a good amount of time (and at the end of a long day, not having to wait around for the ART bus to show up or to have to wait for another because it is loaded).  The hotel was actually quite nice.  I had no major issues at the hotel, so I really didn't have to deal with the service staff much, but I would say they were a mixed bag.

1 helpful vote,4 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hotel close to DIsneyland,"One of the closest hotels to Disneyland, and the best price.   Rooms were clean and a good size. Bring an eye mask - the shutters on the window do nothing to block out the corridor lights.   The pool and hot tub were great, nice to soak after a day in the parks. The pool hours were similar to the park hours though, and often the pool closed before the park did. It would be better if the pool was open earlier and later so that people could actually use it.

The bath was grotty underneath the bath mat.

I had an other hotel I also like booked too, but decided I needed to save money due to the length of my stay and I now regret that choice.  My last review was negative based on how loud this place is.  So, in going about staying here again, logic told me that if I requested way in advance a VERY QUIET ROOM, that requesting this so far in advance, I would likely get a quiet room.  WAY WRONG!

But offering only cold hard boiled eggs as a protein choice for breakfast was very disappointing.  Couldn't you at least have a breakfast sandwich with bacon or sausage and a scrambled egg? We could warm it up in the microwave.  It really would start the day off much better. (I was very tired of hard boiled eggs after day two of a four day stay).

The couch was not comfortable - if a child were sleeping on it, would probably be ok but with any normal adult weight, the springs and metal frame were felt.

The nightstands and dresser's were worn and nicked but it was clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful, the guys parking the cars were great. However, The best part was the location. We'd grab the continental breakfast at 7 and walked over to the front gates and it only took about 5 minutes. We'd come back about 1 for swimming and soaking tired feet in the hot tub. Beacause it was so close it's was easy and quick todo and we were back in the parks by 3 or 4.

I absolutely would stay here again, and recommend it to anyone, for all of these reasons. It's hard to imagine a better way to visit Disneyland for a family.  Cons: Sadly with the great value there are caveats. First of all, the wifi is more or less nonexistent. Yes, there is a wifi service you can connect to, but the speed is so laughably slow that it may as well not even exist. We're not talking ""too slow to stream video,"" I have come to accept that as normal for most budget hotels. No, we're talking ""too slow to load basic web pages without any media in them.""

I requested to change rooms to be closer to the lobby in hopes of piggybacking off the lobby's faster internet. They switched my room but I'm not close enough to pick up the lobby's signal.   It's a shame that something that's a very inexpensive fix is going to cause them to lose a customer.

That might be why they are so passive about a concerns that guests bring up.   The walk to the park is very short which is great for tired feet and tired people. The parking isn't too bad at this hotel either.   They have above and below ground parking. They will even let you come and park even if you are way ahead of check in time.   There is also cheap food within feet of the hotel so you can save meal money inside the park.   Bad.   The A/C is simply blowing in outside air.

My wife was totally grossed out and fortunately, we had already showered for the night. The tub backed up for about ten minutes, so my guess is that the occupants in the room above us had filled their tub and were draining it, which overwhlemed the drain trap in our tub.

Granted, some of the furnishings were a little old and the breakfast pickings were slim, BUT the place was spacious & clean, location was excellent (5 minute walk from DLR gates), and staff were extremely helpful.  We were with friends who had stayed at the Fairfield in the past, and they felt the Desert Inn was much better in terms of room size & cleanliness.  We'd stay there again for sure.",November 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3163,100

On the average we stay 4-5 days and occupy 5-6 rooms.  We usually stay at the ""Desert PALM inn & Suites"" on Katella but unfortunatley due to their recent remodeling, their prices are just not what we're looking for.   I chose the ""Desert Inn & Suites"" this year because location as far as walking distance to Disneyland seemed to be shorter (It was). and distances to local food establishments was a plus too (Denny's-Ihop-McDonalds..just to name a few)  We had a total of 6 rooms, from a 1king room to a 2 room suite.

Room was large and equipped with microwave and small refrig. Room was clean, bed was kingsize, included a sofa and table.  The price of $59.00 a night, we thought, was a good value for this room and location. Breakfast was only Danish and juice or coffee but McDonalds and IHop are only a few steps away.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Meh, won't be back","The Desert Inn and Suites, which was rated the #1 best deal in the Unofficial Guide to Disneyland, was a huge disappointment.  We stayed the first two nights of our 5 night trip at the Fairfield Inn, in order to use up Marriott points I had.  Since the Fairfield was rated 69 in the guide, I was looking forward to staying at the Desert Inn which was rated 79.  The Desert Inn was far inferior to the Fairfield in every respect except square footage.  There were no pictures on the walls, the beds were very low and thin with a view to the bare pipes under the sink, the towels were thin, the furnishings were at least 15 years old, the TVs had very poor reception and no cartoon channels, the elevator worked only intermittently, the tub was gray/brown on the nonskid, the signage on the",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3167,100
1 helpful vote,2 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Good Location... Rooms lacking,"We have Stayed at the Sister Property and enjoyed our stay, but we wanted to be closer to Disneyland. Boy you sure are close! We loved the location ( Even with our room being in the back we were still so close) We could enjoy naps during the day because we were right next door to the park. The staff was friendly and accommodating at the Front Desk and impressed me ( Which is hard as I work in the business.)  What I was not impressed with was the rooms and the service once we got to the rooms. Sure they are a little run down but for the price you are paying it is a great deal! But the towels were thread bare and I found hair on them 2 times during our stay. The bed was as hard as a rock! The breakfast is a joke, toast, watered down juice and bad coffee.  I was sick as a dog and",April 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3168,100
99 helpful votes,32 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Below average hotel with a great location,"I will start with the upside of our stay here. The location is fantastic! Believe what you hear - it is literally a five minute walk to the entry gates at Disneyland, even with kids. We were so close we could go back to our room so our son could nap and then went back to the park in the late afternoon for the second shift.  However, we were pretty disappointed with the hotel itself. I would call the room and hotel utilitarian at best, and at $100 per night we felt pretty ripped off. Our room was quite shabby, with banged up furniture and outdated bedding, carpeting, etc. The sheets were really rough and the bed was none too comfortable. The shower was awful! Cold one second, scalding hot the next, and one day we couldn't get any water pressure - there was just a trickle coming",August 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3169,100

Directly  across  the  street  from  Disneyland  and  CA  Adventure.  We  walked  back  and  forth.  We  had  a view  so  we  could  see  the  Disneyland fireworks  and  the Matterhorn.  Small  rooftop  deck  good  for  viewing  also.  Quick  check in  and  check  out.  friendly  staff.  Gave  us  a  different  room  before  we  checked  in  because  someone  had  smoked  in  the  one  we  were  supposed  to  have.  All  rooms  are  non-smoking.  Room  had  a  spa  tub  which  felt  great  after  a  long  day.  Microwave  and  refrigerator  in  room  were  very  convenient.  Ate  mostly  at  the  parks  but  IHOP  and  Tony  Roma's  are  close  and  good.  Nice  stay.  Indoor  pool  and  spa  not  too,August 2004,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3170,100
