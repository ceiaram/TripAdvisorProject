Plus, we were here 2 separate times within 2 months, for about 14 days total.  The valets are really good, considering it gets pretty busy in the evenings. They are so nice, I thought all valets in Cali were like them, but they are  just unique to Peacock Suites. I imagine its pretty crazy during tourist season.

My second gripe is they check the room every third day of your stay.  We were there for four so it was trips to the front desk to refill tissues and get more washcloths for our family.  It really should be every two days on a four night stay. They handled someone stinking up the place with marijuana.  The pool is open air but covered.  Nice for bad weather but no sunshine to enjoy.

The room is smaller than most resorts, more dorm style but with everything you need.  Felt tight when there was 4 of us, better with 3.  The door that separates the bedroom from the living and dining area did the job for letting some stay up later and others to get up early.  The staff was excellent!!!  Parking, front desk, housekeeping ALL were very helpful.  We had 2 days of the room being cleaned, And 2 visits for cleaning up a glass I broke and found everywhere.  Parking is $12.29 a day (all fees inc) but that is much less than Disney$20.

We stayed at the beginning of Feb. and paid $109 per night.  When you pull up there’s space to park out front while you check in/load/unload. If you’re parking your vehicle you’re required to valet park. Its obvious that they do this in order to maximize how many vehicles they can park in their parking garage/outside given that the hotel is dropped in a very small piece of land. Valet parking is $10-$11 per day and you can come and go throughout the day at that price. A couple of times I noticed that the valet would leave the kiosk and not lock the key box where all the customer's vehicle keys are stored, and they'd be gone a quite some time.

The room was a little small, but it did the job.  The lack of towels in the room, and at the pool were a little annoying.  It was tidy, but not very clean.  The staff itself was helpful.   It was close to Disneyland and the Stadium, but there really wasn't much to do within walking distance.  The Garden Walk was ok, but really empty, and not was really open.   It definitely did not meet my timeshare expectations, and needs to be made bigger, and cleaner.

Again, nothing too extreme but present. The swimming pool is in a very strange location adjacent to the parking garage. It is also underneath the rest of the hotel so even though it is, by identification, an outdoor pool, you will never benefit from sunlight.

As a management team we take guest feedback seriously and appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences on your recent visit with us.  In response to your above comments I want to clarify some of what you listed. First and foremost thank you for the kind words about the staff, we always strive to be friendly and exceed expectations, having said that my biggest concern was your question regarding the concrete sealant that was applied during your stay.  The sealant did have an odor and for that we apologize, however the sealant used was in fact non-toxic and was applied in an open air environment. It was done by a professional crew and we were provided with an MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) to assure the non-toxicity of the sealant. As stated above although the smell of the sealant was not pleasant, it was a necessary part of the finished product and we took every step to make it as seamless as possible for our guests. Again I offer an apology to you and your family for having to endure the smell, but be assured we would never put you or any of our guests in harm’s way.    Lastly I want to acknowledge the housekeeping issues you have explained. Cleanliness is our top priority and we do everything we can to maintain pristine standards. I have personally followed up with every comment you have listed and I truly do appreciate your feedback.

Firstly the hotel did not have free wi-fi and charged $9.95 for a block 24 hour period from 4pm one day to 4pm the next day, so if you logged in at 3.59 and logged out 2 minutes later, you would be charged for two days worth of internet!!

Since you took so much time with them, we thought it would be easier to address each paragraph separately, so please see below for our comments:  THE PEACOCK SUITES:  Location: The hotel is about 5 blocks from Disney property. The Main Gate is essentially in the middle of Disney property, so there is actually a further walk to actually get into the parks. Total distance from Hotel lobby to Main Gate is 1 Mile. I'm sorry, but this is NOT far by any stretch of the imagination. This should be walkable for everyone except those that have ""challenges"" or are just plain lazy (imho).      **PSR Response: Technically, when you run the actual distance from the Peacock Suites to the DIsneyland Resort on a MapQuest, it gives you .09 of a mile. We have had reports from most guests who walk, that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to walk, which is pretty average for most hotels in the area. We also have the convenience of having the Anaheim Resort Transit stop right at the end of our driveway to get all guests over to the Disneyland parks safely and comfortably.   Rooms: We stayed in the 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds and a pull out queen sofabed. Sofabed was NOT as comfortable as the 2 other beds, but do you actually expect it to be? My wife and I slept on that sofabed for 5 nights and we managed to get our rest. The 2 queens were very comfortable. The layout of the room is rather peculiar; the section where the 2 queen beds and the bathroom is immediately insied the entry door. French doors separate the sofabed/fridge/microwave/TV area. Why would you need privacy for the ""living area""? The beds should actually be located where the sofabed is and vice versa; that way people that are staying up watching tv or going in/out of the room or bathroom aren't disturbing the people who are sleeping. Carpets looked fairly clean. Towels in bath were adequate. Nice to have 2 TV's, both with DVD players. View from our room was horrible; looking onto the loading dock of a commercial laundry company. No balcony. AC was noticeably loud when on; may annoy sensitive sleepers.  **PSR Response: We finished a total renovation of the hotel in November of 2009 and we are glad to hear that you were happy, for the most part, with your room.   Property: I've seen some sites mention this property as ""most beautiful in Anaheim"". In reality, it's okay, but I wouldn't call it beautiful. Mind you, I really wouldn't consider any of the hotels around Disneyland beautiful, other than the Disney Hotels themselves. Did not try out the pool or hot tubs, but looked fairly typical of moderate hotel facilities. Very small workout room with 2 treadmills and 1 stationary bike. I never saw anyone in there during my stay.  Parking: I've read a lot of complaints about this. Our experience was very positive. The Valets were very quick and accomodating. FYI there is a parking fee of $8 per day. Notice that I didn't call this a valet fee; you can definately park your own car if you insist, but they will still expect you to pay $8 per day. For all you cheapos out there, you can save some money by telling the valet that you stayed with a relative for a night or two during your stay, and they won't charge you for those nights because you weren't parked at the hotel.   **PSR Response: As we have mentioned in other responses on Trip Advisor, the parking fee has been put into place to assist all guests when they arrive and depart. The Valet is as actually an added bonus! Also, please note that all guests are required to pay the $8.00 parking fee if they are parked on property, for any reason!  Food: No restaurants on site. Anaheim Gardenwalk is literally around the corner and it is a nice/new open air mall with several restaurants. There is also a 7-11 around the corner for picking up snacks and such. The continental breakfast in the morning is fairly representative of what you SHOULD get for a continental breakfast. I've read complaints about the continental breakfast ""only having"" breads, pastries, cereals, fruits, and juices. I suggest some of these people should look up the definition of ""Continental breakfast""!!   **PSR Response: Thank you for your assessment of our continental breakfast! We are one of the few hotels that offers a complimentary continental breakfast, let alone breakfast at all and we while we do see complaints about needing more food, you are correct when you say “continental breakfast”!!!!  We are so pleased to have the Gardenwalk up and running! With all of its’ restaurants, shopping, bowling and movie theater, it is a nice addition to the neighborhood and is literally a 5 minute walk!!!  Information session: Yup it's a time-share sales thing. They'll offer you the usual tour tickets, or theme park tickets etc. Don't waste your valuable time. IMPORTANT: Do yourself a favor and just flat out tell the lady that you're not interested in attending the sessions. Unless you make it very clear, they will call your room and keep calling until you give them a definitive NO!   **PSR Response: Obviously, not everyone is interested in attending a presentation but for those that are, please allow concierge to do the job they have been given to do!  Staff: Friendly, helpfull desk; prompt maintenance, competent housekeeping.   **PSR Response: We have noted this and let the supervisors in all departments know that there is going a wonderful job and that our guests appreciate it!!  **Thank you again for you time!

When she got to the income part and we said we didn't fit it, she turned away from us like we were never there and started talking to another person while she took the things she gave us right out of my husband's hand! Next, our room. We went to the Parks after we checked in and when we got back to the room, there were ANTS everywhere!

PLEASE keep in mind - this hotel is rated ""2 stars"". So if you are expecting Disney Hotel ammenities - well you will be disappointed because this hotel is ECACTLY as described. We had a great room (the extra sleeping area was plenty big), lots of fresh clean towels daily and upon request, we had a broken ironing board and once called they had a new one to us within 10 minutes, the swimming area is just as it looks online, yes it was covered, but that wasn't a problem (there is a sun deck on the fourth floor roof), two hot tubs with 2 different temps. One of the other issues was parking - we arrived on a tuesday and parked in the same spot until Saturday (when more people arrived) but we still had a spot",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,927,74

The cleaning staff was so friendly! The breakfast was'nt that great, no variety the same thing everyday and not really that good. The pool was o.k. we only swam twice, it was a nice break from the park. The Shuttles were great every 20 min.. There are no resturants close by only a 7""11 and the hotel gift shop so food was a problem. I agree with one of the other reviewers there are so many choices, that I would probally choose a hotel with a nicer pool and closer to resturants or one with a resturant.

There is a two-level parking garage on-site and the additional parking outside; plus, there is no charge for parking. The staff was courteous and friendly. They even allowed us to park after we checked out, giving us time to visit the theme parks the rest of the day. The rooms were large, and really liked that the 'living room' could be seaprated from the 'sleeping' area. There are two TV's, VCR, Fridge, Toaster, MicroWave. The pool is heated and there are two jacuzzis. The shuttle to the parks stops in front of the hotel. Free breakfast consists of fruits, breads, cereals, juices, milk, coffee.

The room was so small and cramped, we did not even have a place to place our luggage.  When my sister and her husband open the very stained sleeper sofa, it was impossible to even sit at the breakfast table.  There was one sink in the whole room and that was in the bathroom.  The carpet was dirty, the bathroom tub did not drain and when complaints were given, no one came to even look at it.  What they called a breakfast dinning room, was actually an empty bedroom of the same size and the bathroom sink was the place one got water if it was needed for their coffee or tea.  The walls were so thin, we were unable to sleep due to a very sick child next door coughing for a solid two hours.

11 helpful votes,4 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,No Parking-Pushy Consierge,"We stayed at the Peacock suites with our 4 kids on Jan 14 - 18, 2003. The rooms were clean and ok.  The pool is very tiny and too cold to swim in.  The hot tubs were  cold one night and the other nights they were fine.  The shuttle is not complimentary like it says on the website.  Adults are $2, kids are free.  The part that lost our business was the parking.  We were there when it wasn't busy or full and couldn't find a space to park.  When we asked the front desk clerk said we'd have to park next door at the Red Roof Motel...it's quite a ways to walk.  He also gave the excuse that people have more than one car...unlikely.  The other irritating thing was the minute I checked in,the consierge wouldn't let me pass her without trying to get me to sign up to listen to some 1 1/2",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,934,74

Also the room was clean, the refig, microwave, toaster, vcr, and 2 tv's were great.  The bed was very comfortable, and we were not able to here alot of noise outside of the room.  Now for the bad part!  The parking situation at the hotel is terrible, and therefore I will never stay at this hotel again. An example was on 1/2 and 1/3 we came back from disneyland after 12mn to find zero parking avail.  We had to park 1/2 block down at another hotel and walk on the dark streets with my 2 yearold child, and all our belongings.
