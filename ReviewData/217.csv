They gave our second night away (probably to make a profit to cash in on the busy weekend) without notifying us and we had to find another hotel! I even had the email receipt showing the booking for TWO nights. We checked in late and they considered this a “no show”. Seriously? Why does it matter when I check in when they’ve already gotten my money for the two nights? Greedy and unethical hotel. Luckily many teammates were staying at the La Quinta where we will now be encouraging the entire team to stay at for future tournaments and to avoid this Courtyard.

No upgrade was provided, and instead of free breakfast the hotel will give you vouchers to be spent at their only cafe or at the market, which is not enough for full American breakfast style.
