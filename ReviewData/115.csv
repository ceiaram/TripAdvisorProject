It was easy to get on the highway for a short trip to the park and the McDonald's next door was handy for a bite to eat. Knotts seemed really close though we didn't go there.  The room smelled a bit musty and the shower didn't look clean but other than that the room was fine. We arrived after the hotel after the lobby closed so we had to checkin from the small checkin window which was hard to hear through. The layout of the hotel was a bit odd too.

When you book it asks, “what time will you be arriving?” I put 10, I thought the rooms would be ready since it asked.

Requested 1st floor for mother with bad knees.  She stated that was ok.  When we went to get rooms, she “ran out” of rooms on the 1st floor.  The rooms smelt really bad like smoke and dirty mop water.  The tub drain did not work, the water would back up easily. Had to notify them twice to get it fixed.

Pros Even though we arrived after hours, there was an attendant at the desk to check us in, which was nice.  Check out was easy and seamless.  Cons Our room was really muggy (although the AC did help remedy that). The floor felt damp, there was water damage all over the walls, and the carpet was filthy with dark stains. The shower head had horrible pressure and the towels were extremely scratchy. In the morning I could hear the upstairs neighbors walking around.

The TV is an older box style unit and is small, with poor picture quality and limited channels.  The towels have been there since the Industrial Revolution but were clean.

The popularity rating is based on how many guests find our hotel a best value in terms of service/facility and the price paid. Most of our guests find us the best value in the area and have rated us higher. However, our 4.0 rating in Trip Advisor is not an indication that we offer more amenities than other comparable hotels or we offer more amenities than a hotel that has a higher star rating.  It is an indication that we keep our promises with the amenities we advertise and more and more guests are happy with what we offer for the reasonable rates we charge.  We don’t advertise the amenities guest claimed. I.e. heated pool, 24 hours coffee, etc.  Guest could let us know where she saw these amenities advertised, so that we can take a look at it. Guest could visit our web site, good-nite.com, and see the amenities we offer before making the reservations.  This way guest could make the decision what we offer is acceptable to your needs.

He stated that he noticed all the issues as soon as he entered the room, yet he continued to stay in the room for 4 days without making any complaint during the stay.

AC in this room works, but guest made an assumption that one day it will stop working. Our regular check-in time is at 3.00 p.m., but guest was able to check in at 1.30 p.m. This also shows that we do care about our guest and we do accommodate their needs best way we can.

This was a last minute reservation so I was unsure of what i would find.  I was very fortunate when I booked my reservation at the Good Nite Inn in Buena Park, CA.

The room was clean, the staff was friendly, and I didn't break my bank for the room.

Skip this one if you have other options,"first of all, the room stinks! at least in room# 11X. it had a very strange smell and they put VERY strong air-fresh trying to cover it. And the air-fresh smell the worst! i snees all night.  The room is ok with the price we paid. the restroom is quite old and beat up. toilet takes 3-4 times to flush.  the lobby & dinning area are super small. the breakfast are juice, toast and some cheap sweet taste cream cakes which i didn't have after seeing MANY small flies inside the woodmade cake-case. i noticed the stuff and of course she puts it away. that's just great, we now have Juice and Toast, i ends up walked to the Macdonld right next to it.  oh yea, i asked for a blanket, too. she gave me a dirty blanket that has lots of hair on it. it was nasty, i didn't use it.

3 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Price Great Location,"We stayed at the Good Nite Inn 9/27 thru 10/1/06. We were in town for a wedding and a family member had called a few hotels in the area for rates. The rate she was quoted was actually higher than the $52.00 I received when I called to make a reservation (fall special!). For us, the location was central to various relatives' homes and attractions like Angel Stadium, Disneyland, Knottsberry Farm and Seal Beach that we planned to visit. We found the hotel to be clean and comfortable. The beds and shower were terrific. The room was basically two full-size beds and a TV. It was NOT fancy and we wouldn't have wanted to hang-out there with our two kids during the day much. But since we knew we had a lot of daily and evening activities to pack into our 5 days it worked great for us. My",September 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1130,115
5 helpful votes,10 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great little budget hotel,"Ok - first of all - this is a budget hotel.  Get your expectations in line with that.  I was extremely worried after reading some of the reviews.  But for a budget hotel, I was pleasantly surprised.  Staff on checkin and throughout stay could NOT be more helpful.   Room was larger than expected, and bathroom was very large.  Very safe area for travelling with 2 children.  Breakfast was fine - 2 kinds of toast, english muffins, 4 kinds of danishes, 4 kinds of cereal, milk, OJ, coffee, tea, herbal tea.  Did the trick for most of our 9 day stay.  Pool was excellent, clean, and well lit for night time swims.  Nice quiet room away from elevator on non-smoking floor.   Had booked 2 doubles, actually got 2 queens.  New addition - microwave and mini-fridge in the room.   If you'd rather",August 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1131,115

When I came back from my vacation, I noticed one night charge on my AMEX card so I called this place for refund.  After calling 10 times and leaving voice mails and emails many times, I never heard anything back from this manager “RAJ”   they just want your money, even its only $50.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Decent place to stay,"We stayed 3 nights on March 29,30,31st. We had reserved a room through their site which was real quick and easy.  We managed to receive early check in and the room that we preferred (non-smoking king)was available. Room was clean and acceptable. Desk staff were very friendly and efficient.  We didn't eat the continental breakfast as there was only toast,english muffins and plain corn flakes. We opted to go to the McDonalds next door instead. Had no problem getting a parking space when we got back each night.  Room was pretty quiet except for the loud noise our toilet made when flushing, lol, and a noisy neighbor on one night that was talking to someone really loudly. Not sure if she was just loud or walls were really thin but thankfully, it didn't last long. Shower worked good,",March 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1133,115
7 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disgusting state of room,"We read the reviews and decided on this motel for our stay while going to Disneyland. All we cared about was a clean room and relative quiet. We reserved and pre-paid for a non-smoking room with two beds for three nights. We even called for late arrival, knowing it may be close to midnight before we checked in, having spent the day at Disneyland. We arrived at the motel tired and ready for sleep, walked into the room and were assaulted by heavy cigarette smoke. It permeated the room. Our eyes and throats burned, we tried to air out the room quickly to no avail. Between the two beds alone, I picked up four pieces of trash, a cigarette lighter, a burned match and a beer bottle cap.

Hotel grounds were nice with palm trees and lovely pool although it was too cold to go in during February. Free breakfast of toast, english muffins, danishes satisfied morning hunger. Had reserved a non-smoking room but informed all left was a a smoking one. Room was a bit musty first night but didn't bother us rest of the stay. Staff was helpful. Knott's Berry Farm is about 5 minutes away so great spot to stay at. While 30 minutes from LAX (l.a. airport) quiet, safe neighborhood is well worth the distance.
