none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,DO NOT STAY HERE,"I reserved a smoking room. When I checked in, the man behind the counter told me that I reserved a non-smoking room. They only have two smoking rooms, but if I wanted to smoke in a room, it was an extra $50. I was told that was refundable. I wanted to find another motel, but they will not under ANY circumstance give you refund. Upon checking out, the woman behind the counter argued with me regarding that deposit. She's told me that I agreed to the extra $50 was not refundable. RELUCTANTLY gave me back the first security deposit ($50 cash). I will sleep in my car before staying there again.",September 2020,none,Traveled solo,"Hi jennifergL6912DE,  Thank you for choosing Best Budget Inn Anaheim.
