So I pay an extra $40 a night to be allowed to use the pool?!? Come on! This is one of the few hotels I have ever stayed where the resort fee was actually worth it. Here's the list: free coffee in the morning from 6am to 9am, use of chairs, towels, and even boogie boards for the beach, free beer and wine from 5pm to 6pm, and all the S'Mores you can eat all evening until 10pm.

However when we checked in it was a very different experience. Sutton checked us in and was very rude from the very beginning and her attitude never changed. Upon check in she was uninformed of the daily resort fee’s and how to explain them. I told her we reserved with Omar and how much our fee’s were she said that was not the total amount and Omar reserved it wrong. She then said Omar was off that day so there was nothing she could do. She then asked if we knew Omar?!? And do we want the room or not?

We didn't have much time to explore the hotel or area because our stay was really short but if you are in the area, it is worth staying there.   My only suggestion would be to add more value to the resort fee. As one of the only Kimpton's that I know of with the fee, there should be more to show for it.

Unfortunately due to our guest room location in the Courtyard we do not allow smoking, nor can we allow smoking on the restaurant patio due to California law.

The Shorebreak is a sleek, trendy hotel.

We had a courtyard view on the 3rd floor, the room was quiet but this is a stick-built hotel so we could occasionally hear people walking in the room above us, so if you want a really quiet room, ask for a room on the top floor.

Firstly, this is a very trendy hotel in an unashamedly trendy area.  Rooms are well specced, a good size and an iPod connection were all included.  Wifi wasn't though, not even in the lobby areas.  For a trendy hotel not to have complimentary guest wifi, even in the lobby, in this day and age, is something of a faux pas in my opinion.  Kind of like buying an iPhone without a camera on it.  Secondly, parking.  I expected to have to pay to park, but we were stung for an extra day of parking charges because of when the clocks reset in the underground car park.

I appreciate your comments regarding the experience you claim to have had here at the Shorebreak.  Unfortunately, I am sorry you went through this experience.    While we welcome comments from any guest that stays here, in this particular post I feel like we the Shorebreak Family need to explain our interpretation of what happen in your case.    You mentioned that the hotel is way overpriced.  After looking into your reservation, it was booked through our website, which the rate is confirmed a few times before you accept the reservation.  At the Shorebreak, we have a ""best rate guarantee"".  We do our absolute best to stay in line with the other hotels in the market. Unfortunately, the summer season is when the beach is the busiest and rates tend to be higher in June, July and August.  I am terribly sorry you felt like we piled on the charges.  In the Huntington Beach Market, all of the competitive hotels charge for parking and internet.  Shorebreak sits on a ""city owned"" parking structure, which means they dictate the parking charges, which we post on our website and is also mentioned in every confirmation sent out.  While we do charge for internet, if you join our frequent stay program, which is no charge, you get internet free at anyone of our 40 hotels nation wide.  The Shorebreak is one of the most ""dog friendliest"" hotels on the west cost.  With that being said, we treat every dog just as if they were a guest.  This means we hold ourselves to the highest of cleanliness standards, pet occupied room or not.  In your case, your puppy cause damage to the room.  Any guest that causes damage or stains to the room will be held responsible for the replacement and cleaning of those items.  In this case with your dog, the carpet had to be professional cleaned to get the stains out.  You mention in your comments you knew for a fact that we rented the room the same day, which is completely false.  In fact the room was not able to sell for two days as we did have a professional company come in and clean the carpets.  It also appears that you attempted to clean up after your dog with our bath towels, which we had to disgard after your check out.    Lastly, you also mentioned that there is no where for your pet to go to the bathroom around the hotel.  Since opening in 2009, we have a ""pet-a-potty"" grass area just outside our second floor lobby and there is a large residential area right behind the hotel for people to walk their dogs where there is plenty of grass.  If you as a consumer check all of our reviews, the Shorebreak family is always willing to go out of our way to make sure ALL guests are well taken care of.  With any business everything does not run smooth 100% of the time.  We are genuine and honest with all of our responses to social media postings.  We take responsibility for any mistakes we may have made.  In this case, the experience you claim you had at Shorebreak is not completely factual.

Hotel staff was exceptionally friendly; the valet guy who greeted us was a little brash but then became friendlier once he found out it was our honeymoon. Room was clean and we slept well both nights. Two complaints about the room: no screens on the window & door to balcony which allows pesky flies to invade the room; water pressure in the shower is poor, almost to the point of frustrating. The view from the balcony was fantastic yet the noise from the street below could be bothersome if one heads to bed early with the window/door open.

The corporate rate for this hotel was 1/2 the price of the large name chain brands that are 5 blocks away also on Pacific Coast Highway.  We rented 1 room for 2 nights and a 2nd room for 1 night.  Both rooms were fantastic!  They were very spacious and well equipped. From the parking valet at the door and the counter personnel were very pleasant and helpful.

The staff once again proved their professionalism to my guests and myself. All previous comments apply, but I'd like to add a review on our meeting. The one thing that could have been better was housekeeping. They had a tendency to leave things around, not pick up towels off of the floor, robes not hung and on some days, coffee not replenished and dirty cups left behind. (I was there for 10 days.) When we had our meeting, the bad weather across the country was beginning. To that end, we had many clients who could not make the meeting on time, some not at all.

Some of your issues with our staff and services were very concerning to me and my management staff, so I have taken the time to investigate all the issues you have addressed in your review.

Both clerks who checked you in and checked you out have been spoken too in regards to giving our guests more information regarding the club benefits.  I have to also apologize for the delivery of the free amenity our Joy of Life Club members get immediately after arrival.  Please understand at 1pm right after we checked you in early there is no way we could have known you had been traveling since 1am and wanted to sleep.

I am very familiar with your situation as the staff is great about notifying me about any issues here at the hotel.  Please accept my apology for any challenges you had during your stay.  I understand your frustation and concerns.  For you to take the liberty of posting on tripadvisor and sending a online comment card to our corporate office, means we need to address every issue you had with the utmost care.  I have looked into the noise issue and my understanding is that it was from the street below, which the police were called and the problem was solved as soon as we knew about it.  We are quick to jump on any noise complaint guests have whether it is in or outside of the hotel.  It is more difficult to respond to noise complaints from outside the hotel because as hotel staff we just cannot go out onto the street and ask them to quiet down. Although sometimes we wish we could.  In a case like this, we have to wait for the police to respond.  I am so sorry if they took longer than you expected.  The dog urine in the elevator was immediately reported and cleaned up by the staff.  As you know, our hotel is a ""dog friendly"" hotel and we do our best to ensure that guests without dogs don't even know they are here.  By giving our pet owned guest's a ""pet policy"" letter upon check in, the rules and policies in place are explained regarding having a dog on property as to not disturb other guests.  We do our best to police this, unfortunately in this case a dog had an accident in the elevator and we reponded immediately.  I have taken the comments regarding your stay very serious.  I have already spoken to housekeeping regarding the cleanliness and  coffee replenishment issues.  Please understand that we do not make the sofabeds because of health code reasons.  We want every guest to know that we remove the sheets upon every check out and make the bed when requested, so you know the linens are fresh and clean.  This letter to tripadvisor has been passed on to every department and I have also forwarded it to a city official regarding the noise on the street so late at night.

The decor is a little cheesy but cute and trendy.  Wine hour for hotel guests is nice, and the hotel restaurant Zimzala is good.  Plus, they recycle in the room.  Cons:  There are tons of noisy, drunk bar goers stumbling down the hallways at 2am and the walls are thin.  The rooms are tiny and ours had a view of a concrete wall.  There are nice outdoor areas, but no pool.  They stop serving room service around 11pm, and the only option for late-night food is an off-site delivery service.  Also, valet parking is mandatory and it's $24/night.  Overall, it's a cute hotel, but don't book it for a romantic or quiet getaway.

We appreciate the positive comments regarding the Hotel's style, wine hour, Zimzala and our recycling program recycling.  We strive to connect to everyone including guests who are ""Green"".    Please accept my sincere apology for the noise issue at the hotel.  Hopefully you notified the front desk and we were able to quiet them down.  Social events are very popular here, so we have implemented a 10:00pm ""quiet time"".  This means if a guest complains about noise from a room, hallway or public area, Hotel Management will warn them once.  If the disturbance continues we evict the guest with no questions asked.    As for the parking charge, I understand your issue.  Unfortunately, as I have mentioned in so many reviews before this, we sit on a city owned parking structure.  The city charges for the parking.  Even employees get charged for parking.  It is an unfortunate circumstance that we have to deal with on a daily basis.

The restaurant, Zimzala, has good food, a little pricey for what it is, but the calamari and ice cream are especially good.   We only found two negatives with the hotel, you have to valet park, and thats $24 a day. People have mentioned that on here before. The second thing is that internet is $10/day per computer or device. That gets really expensive fast. I think hotels should obviously be giving out internet for free, but thats just another way for them to make money off of you, I suppose.

The reason is that our kids stayed in another hotel with many pools while we stayed at the Shorebreak. So this was the best of both worlds, we could visit them and swim, or we could have our own time together at the Shorebreak. The rooms were great and the staff really nice so we enjoyed this hotel. As for swimming, if they don't have a pool (and actually I don't think they do) you could go in the ocean but it is very cold in winter (not so warm in summer either I expect).
