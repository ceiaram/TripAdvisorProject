You have a full kitchen with cookware/dishes, the whole package.  It felt like being at home.  The carpet is a little outdated but that's something you will experience at any of the Hotels near by.

The suite is nice as it gives everyone a little bit of extra room.  The breakfast and easy reception definitely helps the budget and there is a nice family restaurant/sports bar in the parking lot, and an outback just a few steps away.   The shuttle to Disney is reasonably priced - about $5 per day for adults, and you can come and go as much as you want every 30 minutes. In my opinion it's way better than trying to park and then shuttling to your car.   The staff is do friendly and the rooms are cleaned.

There were a couple of days when we decided to take the food back to the suite so we could get ready quicker which worked out fine as well.  The breakfast consisted of coffee, juices, milk, cold cereals, oatmeal, toast, bagels, yogurt, fruit, eggs, some type of meat, and generally another dish or two as well as another pastry/waffle of some sort.

I also had problems keeping a constant water temp as it would get extremely hot or extremely cold in seconds.

The Disney shuttle was a good value as we made 2 round trips per day, but we had some trouble with overcrowding one day and bus maintenance another day.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hotel, great location",Hi stayed in the hotel late August 2013. Made the mistake of staying in one hotel for the whole 2 weeks holiday. As California is so big really you need to travel on and not return. Having said that we did enough in Anaheim/Los Angeles not to be bored in that time. The hotel location is great for Disney as its a 10 minute walk. My kids were older so we only went to Disney for the day. The road links are great in any direction. The actual hotel whilst not the best on this strip was definitely not the worst and I felt it gave great value for money.  I was surprised to find the hotel supplies a basic breakfast and dinner which we only used twice. The suite was nice.

My overall reaction of this hotel has changed since it is getting well past it's prime. Previous amenities and facilities I was so impressed with before are now run-down and not maintained.  I have recommended many families to stay here when they were planning their trip to Disney, (and who actually booked and stayed there) as there is a shuttle, free breakfast and each room in a suite, which is fantastic.  (My positive experience this trip in 2013 was made because of the SUPERB front desk staff, who were always extremely friendly, professional and helpful.)

The breakfast buffet had many things to choose from and that saved us quite a bit of money to be able to feed our children before heading to Disney.  The rooms were clean and quiet.  The only negative thing I have is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel and they are very slow on top of it. We spent a lot of time just waiting for elevators with our strollers.  Not a big issue but my friend has stayed here before when they offered free shuttle service to Disneyland. Now you have to pay $5 a day per person.

When we got into the room and unloaded everything my wife took off her shoes and stepped into a big puddle of soda that had soaked into the carpet. I can see why housekeeping missed it because you couldn't see it at all and if you had shoes on, you probably wouldn't notice it. A call down to the front desk and they moved us into the next room over. They even waived the parking fees for us haveing to pack up our stuff and move!  Otherwise, everything was great.

We booked our trip through Costco.com (highly recommended). Since we booked with Costco.com, we got free daily parking (saved us $12 a day), got free shuttle passes (saved us more $$$) with this hotel.  Positives: 1. Excellent, excellent, excellent customer service. This is pretty consistent with the Hilton brand. 2. Rooms are suites with kitchen and very spacious. 3. Rooms were clean. 4. Strangely but very quiet. No foot steps heard above at all! Did not even notice any noise from our neighbors. Only heard fire works at 9:30 from Disneyland and that is it.  5. Free breakfast. 6. Free dinner and beverages (Monday through Thursday) from 5-7. 7. Nice pool  Areas to Improve: 1. The furniture needs some",September 2011,none,none,"We thank you for sharing both the positives and areas to improve from your recent stay with us.

We were not disappointed in any way with our decision. We arrived early to our hotel around 1:30 PM and we were able to check in immediately. On the day we were to check out, our plane did not leave until late afternoon, so the hotel stored our luggage while we spent the day in Downtown Disney. No problems what-so-ever.  The accommodations were great. We had a two room suite with two bathrooms which was great since we had my Mother and Aunt also traveling with myself, my husband and four year old daughter. The facility was well maintained and our room was very clean. We did put up each night our ""do not disturb sign"" so that the maid service would not wake us up.
