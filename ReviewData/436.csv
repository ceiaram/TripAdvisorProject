The attraction is camping next to the beach for surfing, swimming, fishing, sand play for kids and allowed to have your dog while on a leash.

They climbed into the undercarriage of vehicles and even tried to get into our trailer.They were completely unafraid of anything. It did not appear that the staff has a plan to control them. I do not have a solution but maybe a call to OC vector  control is in order. We will be back to Doheny in Sept. and Nov 2017 and hope there is an effort to control the rodents because I fear that one of the kids will be bitten or become ill if they come into contact with the rodent droppings.

You climb a tiny sand dune and are looking down at a lovely, pebble-strewn beach that has low, gentle waves that is perfect for families.  This was our 3 1/2 year old son's first night tent camping and we roasted hot dogs and s'mores over our fire with a picturesque sunset.  Can't get any better than that...

Yes it's beachfront but extremely run down. Bathrooms are hit and miss, sometimes clean, sometimes disgustingly filthy. It feels like the train is running through your campsite at night.  The beach is right off a major drainage route San Juan Creek. That drains directly into the ocean when it rains and tons of contaminants are washed into the ocean. Totally disgusting.   I booked a space and my reservation said 2 vehicles. I parked my RV and rented a car locally. They charged $15 per day because the car ""was not towed in"" even though I am entitled to 2 cars.

As others mentioned...not uncommon to have the homeless strolling through at times but have never had an issue. Once again....great if you can land the beachside site, maybe not so much for other sites.

The beach front sites go fast, there are others but not so nice, a little crowded and some very close the train and traffic noise. The beach is not that good for swimming, a little pebbly sand and a bit of a rip. Children under 12 or so would need to be supervised closely.
