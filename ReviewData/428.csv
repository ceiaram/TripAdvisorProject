71 helpful votes,132 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice little Blast from the Past,Excellent for the price.  This was a typical little motel right out of the 1950's/1960's.  It's nothing fancy AT ALL but it is super clean and the grounds and pool are pretty darn well kept.  It's within walking distance to many places including Katella Deli which has a great breakfast and bakery.  It's also conveniently located close to the freeway and you really can't beat the price. The room was just fine to take a rest between destinations and to sleep at night.  I would definitely recommend it.,February 2020,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,428

I feel like you see people cleaning all the time! The rooms are simple, but spotless. The pool is crystal clean. Second best of all is the kitschy quaintness of this place! It's like a little trip back to 1975. I hope they never get rid of their neon sign! If you stay here, you can walk over to the Starting Gate Night Club a couple blocks away, drink & dance the night away, then walk back to your hotel room. It's perfect!

Not being a travel expert, I only know this: if there is a better deal for a simple, well-kept, quiet little motel in a 50-mile radius of this place, I don't know where it would be. Don's is completely comfortable, and usually has vacancies. Pristine pool too. It's down the street from the best deli in Orange County - Katella Deli; it is a half-mile from one of the best seafood spots in the area - the Original Fish Company (famous clam chowder!); and, if you're like me and go nuts for exotic food, it's within striking distance of the great Vietnamese and Indian communities in Garden Grove and Artesia",November 2016,"Bathtubs are on upstairs floor only -- otherwise, rooms are similarly good",Traveled solo,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,7,428

We've stayed at Don's Turf Motel before, but we were amazed at their rooms!  They have been upgraded since our previous stay a couple of years ago.  We had to be out of our home while work was being done and this was such a nice option!  Although, they don't have as many amenities as some of the larger hotels in the area, the staff friendliness and the quality that we get make it more than worth it.    Our rooms were clean and well maintained during our stay.  The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of towels, we even were able to get some extra towels.

But, it is clean, quiet and inexpensive. Since I work in the area but live out of the area, I needed a clean, quiet and economical place to stay 3 or 4 nights a week. This place works out ok. No cable TV or internet but, management is very accommodating. I have stayed there 3 or 4 times now and, so far, it works for me. Depending on where your room is located, there can be a lot of street noise. But, I really haven't had a problem as yet. There is a great restaurant down the road with a great happy hour. I eat most of my evening meals there during happy hour. The place is called the Gourmet Cafe and Bakery. It's just across from COSTCO.

We were visiting Los Al (from Washington State) for the horserace meet and to celebrate my father's 75th birthday.    We used to stay at Don's Turf when I was growing up (in the 1970s and 1980s), but in the late-80's it felt into disrepair.  We hadn't stayed since, but decided to give it a try after having had a disappointing experience at the local Courtyard by Marriott, from which we departed after only one night.    The TripAdivsor reviews for Don's Turf were positive, so I felt it was worth a go.  Because the rooms were inexpensive ($75 for two double beds, or $50 for one queen), we booked two rooms.
