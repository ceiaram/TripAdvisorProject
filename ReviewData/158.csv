It is conveniently located, and although on the freeway, the rooms are quiet and spacious and clean.  Having said that, my yesterday's stay was a shock. Little things make a hotel great or ordinary, and the Ayres is no longer great. Firstly, the toilet paper, which in prior stays was on par with Charmin, was one ply thick. As a money saving measure it fails as one is forced to use twice as much to do the same job. Secondly, while before the bath towels were fluffy and lush, these were as harsh and scratchy as sandpaper.

The heater vent was too loud although it kept the room warm. I missed the breakfast at 9:45am? I thought it was offered for a longer time. Also after I checked in I went to the Target store nearby. I came in through the back door with my bags and a gentleman in a suit named Jeremy just stared at me while I struggled to open the door with my card and with 3 heavy bags. Oh well chivalry is dead.

Breakfast offering was great. The front reception was nice and accommodating. We were able to check in early which was nice because we had traveled since 4am and it was nice to take a nap before the wedding. My only complaint was the server in the breakfast area. We decided to work one morning and he keep trying to get us to leave because he wanted to sweep. I said he was welcome to sweep while I was there but he wouldn't budge on getting us to move. I kindly said that I had too much paperwork and my computer to move so I wasn't going to move. He sat there and tapped incessantly in the table to irritate me and hemmed and hawed.

We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and attractiveness of the rooms. They were large, clean, and very comfortable. Obviously if you are attending a wedding at Old Ranch, the location could not be better (it's right across the street).   The reason for the deduction of a dot and a half is for a couple of reasons: 1.  The location and proximity to the freeway is not awesome. It was especially bad due to the construction going on during the night.  2.  The staff was not terribly accommodating.
