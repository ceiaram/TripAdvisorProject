The room was nice, the jetted tub was amazing and the breakfast buffet was a good deal. There were even strawberries and champagne with a nice Happy Anniversary note when we got to our room.  When we made our reservation, the price of the buffet was $10 but by the time we arrived the price had gone up to $12.99. When I mentioned the difference in price, the agent at the front desk was more than happy to adjust the rate for us. The only draw back was that we could hear the pipes whenever someone in one of the adjoining rooms was running water. It was quite loud really and depending on how long someone wanted to shower, it could drag on for what seemed like forever.",May 2015,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,866,122

The rooms were decorated with much more fancy furniture. I was not expecting our bathroom to have a humungous jet tub in it--which was an added bonus.

I stayed away from fear that is was near the airport and also it was in an industrial area right off the 73. Stayed because my usual spots were booked or had jacked up the prices in-season. I feared my wife wouldn't like it because it wasn't a name brand. She landed before me and checked in first (I had a business appt). She called me and I asked her how she liked it. I was prepared to move after the first night. But, she said she loved it. Very quaint and European in feel.

We found the back door to the hotel propped wide open when we finally found a place to park and brought our luggage in.

I had gotten a great rate through Hotwire but I was still pleasantly impressed when I arrived.   This hotel was unique. It had a nice décor and everything had a picture hanging on it. Even the hallways were memorable with pleasant oil paintings hanging all along the walls. These were pleasant paintings with recognisable themes unlike modern “art” that leaves you baffled. The room we got was extremely pleasant. It was spotless clean and very beautifully decorated in an old style. I absolutely loved it. It also had a very deep jacuzzi.

Went inside and enquired about cost and availability and managed to get room (Junior suite) with breakfast and drink coupons for $95 per night.  Before we signed in we checked the room out and boy was it nice. Plenty of space (have 10 year old daughter) nice furnishings and all round enjoyable place. Breakfast good but repetative, pools clean quiet (except for planes) the whole experience was one of enjoyment. The cookies and the fruit were a source of amusement as my daughter made a point of shouting that a flight crew was checking in so get to the cookies before they do.

We paid $129 a night on the Ayres website, and checked out two days early because it was so mediocre.  Our room was tiny, there was no microwave, and the fridge was stuck under the bathroom counter. (Ayres usually have a small bar with a fridge and microwave.)  Housekeeping was marginal, and access to our room was achieved by walking down two tiny concrete steps, under some scaffolding, and through a back entrance.    We didn't book on Hotwire, but the couple ahead of us did, and they were arguing about their accomodations with staff.  Apparantly this is a problem they aren't willing to work out.

Staff has gone out of their way to help me. Hotel restaurant is pricey, but there are MANY places nearby.
