That included the day we checked in, and the day that I complained to the Assistant General Manager about the poor standard of housekeeping.  Had to make a trip to the front desk every night, to obtain enough towels for my family. My concerns regarding the poor housekeeping fell on deaf ears at the front desk.  Garbage bins were rarely cleaned.  Discarded cups and used coffee pods were usually not removed.  The bathroom’s condition caused the most concern. I am convinced that other than supply new soap bars, the housekeeper did no cleaning here.  Used towels were usually not picked off the floor.  Mediocre breakfast items and a particularly rude attendant there led us to only eat there once.  Surrounding area was not",March 2019,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,33,173

Room: Standard room with standard amenities, but everything was new, the room was spacious, the bed was very comfortable. Keurig in room for coffee/ tea.

Staff: Every single person we encountered was super friendly and helpful. Definitely what we needed after long Disney days.  Location: Convenient for Disney (about 20 minutes in the morning, 10-15 minutes late night) . If you plan to drive yourself to the park, this hotel is a good option.

Its one of the best value hotel in the LA area in my opinion. The hotel offers a balcony in every room with sweeping views of Orange County, what some run down 5 star hotels charge an arm and leg for in LA. I had a king bed room on the 9th floor.

The bathroom was well lit and modern as well, with great shower water pressure. Only complaint is the sink is poorly designed, big gap between where you stand and the sink basin.

Room 807 was fairly quiet except for traffic. You are unable to open the very large window with great view (they said its county law). The window is not insulated for sound so the traffic sounds come right through.  The bed is high. I am tall so it wasn’t a problem for me but if you are older, or very short, you will not like it. The bathroom sink is oddly far away; it’s hard to spit toothpaste out or shave. The hot water didn’t turn off in the sink, cold is okay initially but once you turn the faucet handle left for hot, the water remains very hot even when you push it far right for cold.

The room is super modern and clean. We loved the bathroom. One issue is the sliding glass door only opened about 6 inches. There was a mechanism in place to keep it from opening fully. That was a bummer since we were on the 9th floor and it has a full balcony. Weird.   When we arrived, it was dark, about 10PM. You definitely get the feeling you are not in the best neighborhood.
