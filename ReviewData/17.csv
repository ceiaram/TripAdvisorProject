Firstly, the room (232) was DANK. The room was incredibly humid and stayed that way despite running the AC unit on ""dry"" basically overnight. This was far from comfortable, and is my biggest complaint. The shower was clean, but the water barely went beyond lukewarm. TV was fine, but the remote had no ""guide"" button, so you had to manually navigate to the guide channel, which was beyond annoying.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Room was great!,"The hotel was very nice, everything was clean and free any bugs. Beds were a little stiff but we spent very little time in them with going to Disney every day. The walk wasn’t bad, and for the price of the hotel I would stay here again. The exterior of the hotel could use some TLC or updates but the inside was very nice and not what I was expecting after seeing the exterior. The reason I gave it a 3 is for the following: upon arriving at the hotel they asked me for a credit card and would not accept my Apple Card because there wasn’t a number on it.

Had to change dates and management was gracious enough to allow us to transfer dates to Thanksgiving week with a small increase in price ($80). Went to Disneyland which is a block away, so we walked and saved $$$ on parking! The breakfast service was outstanding and the staff running the breakfast are second-to-none in service. The rooms were clean and much more modern than the exterior suggests. No issues with noisy neighbors or insect/rodents. Felt safe in the room at night. The only concerns were: inability to open a window (a/c is only way for fresh air) and avoiding the particularly scary homeless people on the way to Disneyland (on the ones that are displaying erratic behavior).",November 2019,none,none,"Thank you for the review.

If you go into with low expectations you will be fine.   The rooms are decent enough, they've been updated with LVP flooring. While this looks nice, it makes for a little bit of a gross situation in your sheets at night because unlike when you walk on carpet, when you walk on LVP, your feet pick up the little crumbs of dirt which end up in your sheets at night. I would have preferred carpet that gets vacuumed daily.   Coffee only restocked one day that we were there.  The shower plumbing is very loud so if the person below you takes a shower, it is VERY loud and it will wake you up.

The hotel is a quick 10-15 minute walk to the security gates at Disney.  Great location!

Its location is within walking distance of Disneyland, coupled with the free parking, and reasonable rates which include free ""breakfast"" (I'll get to that more in a minute), made it a reasonable solution for our family to visit.    The rooms are air tight, making them very humid, and hard to air out. The air conditioner was not quite satisfactory to remedy the humidity in the space.  The fan in the bathroom was very loud and largely ineffective, and there was no tub--a big no-no with a toddler.    Breakfast was the biggest disappointment.

8 helpful votes,27 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,New favorite place to stay during Disney Vacation,"Stayed at the King’s Inn in on Katella Ave for the first time in December of 2017 during our annual Disneyland vacation. Chose it for its price and what appeared to be a reasonable walk to the park. It’s can get exhausting with two kids, each with their own stroller, ESPECIALLY after a 16 hour day at the park like we usually do (we do Disney the right way haha), so location was key and this was the furthest we had ever stayed from the park with the intent to try walking there. It TOTALLY worked out. The walk from the inn is literally a 4-minute walk to the corner of Katella and Harbor and then maybe a 10-min walk to the entrance to the park. We’ve been able to maneuver and choose crosswalks wisely and get to the park in no time at all, it’s super convenient. And not only that,",December 2018,none,none,Thank you for the great review.

The hotel itself looks to be a reincarnation of a previous hotel of some sort.  Its older styling means rooms with doors that face the outside and a small centrally located, not very private, pool.   The rooms themselves appear to be fairly recently updated with new furnishings and décor.  They contain a refrigerator, but microwave is in the laundry facility elsewhere on site.  Hardwood (laminate) floors take some getting used to. Also getting used to is not having a tub, only a shower (at least in the room we stayed in).

Their computer at the “business center” - a small corner of the very small lobby - was not working, but they immediately offered me an alternative solution.

We were able to walk to the main gate within 15-20 minutes.  I was very surprised by the wood floors.  Everything was very clean and there was plenty of storage for our clothes. The lamps had outlets on them and the nightstand had a USB port on each side.  There was a single cup coffee brewer.  The breakfast was adequate, but as others have mentioned, a protein would have been even better. We did have a couple of problems with our room, but they were promptly fixed.

There is also a very close ART shuttle stop to get a quick ride to the park and many other locations.  The rooms are decent and the one I was in seemed to have been recently remodelled.  Nice hot tub and pool on site.  Pool ranges from 3.5 to 8.5 feet in depth and appears to be a salt water pool as opposed to a chlorine based pool.  They do offer Continental breakfast but it seemed to be lacking.  The options were limited to waffles, cereal, fruit, toast.

Paper thin windows/walls and was awoken every morning from a truck constantly backing up (so don't book a room in the back of the complex!).

2 helpful votes,6 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Better than expected,Given the location (close to Disneyland) and the money paid and the clearly updated rooms I have to admit this place was much better than expected.  The free breakfast in the morning seemed to overwhelm the staff running it and there was too many people in there at once but maybe we just happen to catch it at a bad time.  The beds seemed new and a little firm which was ok for one of us.  The AC was tough to gauge as well it was either too cold with it on low or way too warm with no air on at all.  But again...given the price we paid and the location its tough to beat the value we got and the nice safe room.

It has comfortable beds and is within walking distance to the parks. They also offer a free breakfast but it has very limited options and a tiny seating area.

Be aware that the rooms are motel-style and are accessed from outside. I was traveling alone as a female and wasn't terribly comfortable with this but didn't have any issues.

The water pressure in the shower was not that great, the continental breakfast was a joke, my room didn't come with the described safe in the listing (though, at least when I was there, there was just a bunch of families looking to have a good time at Disneyland so I wasn't too scared for my belongings) and lastly, their wifi did not work for me. It was probably a issue with my computer, and apparently Windows 8 did have problems with old routers, but the kind staff in the office didn't have the first clue how to troubleshoot a internet issue. And I ended up having to use the slow internet at the convention center. But those were my only real complaints. The A/C cooled well. The fridge was adequate.

It is great to hear you found them to be so friendly and helpful and you found their customer service skills to be so amazing. It is always great to hear when we exceed our guest's expectations. It is always our goal to exceed our guest's expectations. We have recently been awarded the ""Pride of Super 8"" award. To get this award you must excel in all areas, such as front desk, housekeeping, maintenance, and over all property conditions. We are inspected every quarter and you must receive an ""A"" consistently. We have always passed with flying colors as our property is Super clean and well kept.

Bubba Gumps, PF Changs, California Pizza, and the Cheesecake Factory are some favorites. I am sorry to hear you had some issues with the room you were staying in. We do have a 24 hour front desk available, so our guest's  can contact us with questions or concerns regarding their room at any time. We do have a TV guide in every room. It is actually on  the TV itself. The cable company provides a complete listing of channels and descriptions  of the programming in great detail.  We do provide remotes for our guest's and sometimes during the guest stay the batteries may need to be replaced. A simple call to the front desk at any time can easily fix this. We do not provide transportation to the Disneyland park as we are only a 15 minute walk to the park entrance, however, the City of Anaheim does provide the ART shuttle that operated every day. it starts running an hour before the park opens and runs up to an hour after it closes.

Fortunately, I bring air fresheners with us on trips, just in case. There is a CVS on the corner not too far, which was convenient for buying cheaper bottled water and putting in the refrigerator at the hotel, and or air fresheners if need be. Wasn't a bad walk to Disneyland. (I am not a walker, so that is saying a lot) But it is doable and saves you the parking fee at the park. I noticed that the housekeeping staff turned off the air conditioning while we were gone, so the room was warm when we got back to it.

We wish there would've been a bit more room at breakfast time downstairs as we never got to sit down and eat our breakfast, it didn't quite accommodate for the number of guests. However that being said we would just go out for breakfast down the road which was easy and cheap enough anyway :)   Overall, very happy with the stay",December 2015,none,none,"Thanks for the review.

The purpose of this trip was to spend multiple days at the Disneyland Resort and also to attend the D23 Expo at the Anaheim Convention Centre. Therefore, location (and price point) of the hotel had to be optimal for this trip. The Super 8 definitely met both of my expectations in this regard.

When I called I asked if the hotel had a shuttle to Disneyland just in case my 5 year old was too tired to walk back home. They said ""yes"" they did have a shuttle. When we got there we noticed right away that the pool was about half the size of the Motel 6 pool. Bummer. Then when we got into the room the room was smaller too!

Which was actually the city shuttle to and from the theme parks!!",August 2015,none,none,"Thank you for the review, and thank you for choosing us when visiting the Disneyland park. It's true we do not operate our own shuttle service to and from the Disneyland park. The ART shuttle (Anaheim Resort Transit operated by the city of Anaheim) does service most the motels/hotels in the area surrounding Disneyland. This does include us as well as the Motel 6.  They use the ART as well. This shuttle does pick up right next door and operates an hour before park opening till an hour after the park closes. It runs about every 20 minutes and there is a small charge for taking the bus. We do have a few guests who do like to take the shuttle, particularly after a long day at the park. We are just a quick 10 to 15 minute walk to the park entrance, its one and a half blocks from here. I do apologize if there was any confusion or misunderstanding when you called and asked if there was a shuttle to the Disneyland park. There is indeed a shuttle, however it is not operated by us the Super 8. Information on rates etc for the ART would be available through their website. We never quote the rates for their services as they are set and collected by the ART service. We do have a nice heated pool and hot tub here on property.

I do have to clarify some statements that you have made that are in no way correct and I feel I must correct those statements.  1- The night staff had no access to bedding or any cleaning equipment when our daughter was sick during the night and just said there is nothing that can be done and that it will have to wait until the morning for the cleaners!  This is not correct. When in deed our housekeeping staff would be arriving in the morning,  our 24 hour front desk staff does indeed have access to bedding and cleaning equipment at all times, including in the night.  2- Reluctantly one member of the night staff found some towels & a box of tissues and assisted with the clean up process. This is not correct, as our front desk staff member was more than happy to assist, and he also provided you with extra clean and new sheets, blankets and new pillows which you fail to mention.  3-The breakfast room is really tiny and holds 15 seated people max and is not fit for purpose. (very misleading photos on website) This is not correct, actually the breakfast area has 50 chairs inside as well as additional seating outside on our sun deck, allowing for more than adequate seating as the breakfast hours are from 6 am to 9 am. All photos listed on the Super 8 website are indeed correct and are not misleading.  4-The washing Facilities (3 x washing Machines / 3 x Tumble Dryers / machine supplying powder and bounce sheets) were unreliable as most days at least one machine was out of use.(misleading photos on website, again very small room and not enough machines when considering all the rooms) Machines keeping cash and not working  This is incorrect as well as most days machines are working properly and photos on the website are  not misleading, it shows 3 washers and 3 dryers. And any cash that you say you lost was indeed refunded.  5- Swimming pool - More misleading clever photos. This pool is an ""after thought"" and placed in between access roads to / from hotel rooms The pool was put in when the property was established and it was not an ""after thought"" and all photos on our website are correct and not misleading. And the pool is no where near the main road.  6- The staff didn't care about our two children or us (2 adults) and were quite happy for us all to remain overnight in a smelly vomit filled room with it all over the floor and walls. This too is incorrect as our staff went over and above to assist in cleaning up after your ill child and provided extra bedding so you could sleep in a clean room after this unfortunate incident of a sick child in the night.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1826,17

Although the breakfast is very basic (cereal, toast, fruit, etc), its what I usually eat anyway.  Parking is free.  There are several restaurants within a 5 min. walk.  My biggest complaint is probably that the towels were so small, but its a Super 8, not a 5 star resort and they gave me extra's.  It was perfect to come back to after an exhausting day at the park, chill in the hot tub/pool, then go get a nice dinner.

Also the bathroom was worn but not dirty. The carpets needed to be cleaned but the beds were comfortable and clean.  Breakfast was nothing special. And the tv was fuzzy.

Still no hot water.  The time a couple years before when we stayed here the hot water was cut off for an entire afternoon while they worked on it.

When we",January 2012,none,none,"While we appreciate the review, we do have a couple issues with it, and would like to explain a couple things regarding your comments.  Our standard policy regarding lost and found is as follows: When an item is left in a room, we lock it in a secure room. Only two people have  a key to this room, The General Manager, and the Head of housekeeping. This is for our guests security. By 4.00 pm the head of housekeeping, as well as the General Manager had left. It took 45 minutes, because the General Manager was off property,but once called came and unlocked the room where your item was being safely kept. The General Manager retrieved the item and gave it to the front desk clerk Ron. (who is not a manager).  Ron has worked here for 20 years, and follows procedures, He was following procedures regarding lost and found items as set forth by management. Regarding the extra charge on your credit card; this was because you smoked in a non smoking room. This is clearly marked on the registration card upon check in and you sign where it says you will be charged an addition $100 plus tax if you smoke in  a non smoking room. This fee is to cover the additional cleaning costs so we can make it acceptable for other guests who request a non smoking room and expect it to be free of smoke. We do offer smoking rooms, if guests wish to smoke in their room. In regards to not being allowed back, it was not because you left an item in the room. It was for other reasons, which fall within our guidelines to have the right to refuse service.

A neat perk was the free trial sizes of lotion, toothpaste, etc, as well as a simple coffeemaker and a few packs of tea and coffee.
