23 helpful votes,42 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Don’t stay at the Sandpiper Motel Costa Mesa,"I had booked this motel for a four night stay thinking it was a good location and decent for the price. I arrived around 11 pm exhausted from the road trip to pull into this motel with homeless people loitering.  We were tired so checked in but asked if we were not happy if we could check out the next day and get refund on remaining nights. The clerk said no problem. To say the least, the room was disgusting. It reeked and the floor felt slimy. The sheets were extremely rough. The bed hard. No room to place toiletries in the bathroom. No room in shower either. A small space in shower for shampoo but it kept falling. There was a demonic image on the tile worked into the design. A couple fought loudly all night. When it was time to check out, a young girl with attitude was working",October 2020,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,358

We stayed here for 2 weeks and really enjoyed it, it was clean with OK decor,  flat screen/HBO TV, a fridge comfortable bed, not that noisy concidering its next to the 55...no phone but who needs one these days!!! The staff were mostly friendly and pleasant, the place is so handy to shops and movie theater just down the road....walking distance.....OC fair 5 mins up the road.",July 2019,none,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,2,358

Had I seen the room before checking in, I would have been outta there. The shower had so many repairs with putty and it was filthy! The bathroom window almost fell out and the bedspread was extremely dirty. To me, this place is a 1 or 2 hour f*^@ joint. Believe me, we saw it first hand. My advice to anyone thinking of staying in this rat hole, check the rooms first before paying. They offer no refunds once payment is made.",November 2018,There are none. This place is disgusting!!

If you are on a budget, it is OK as the rooms have been remodeled. Be sure you get one of those. It is right by Newport Beach Blvd. The owner is a miser who won't pay for anything. I have stayed there several times. The biggest problem is the Wi Fi doesn't reach more tham two doors down from the office. I had to bring my laptop to the office. There it worked fine.

37 helpful votes,40 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,No frills. You get what you pay for.,"I stayed here for one night after attending a friends wedding in Newport beach and was not able to drive home. Just wanted somewhere to lay my head and wouldn't be too costly. The sand piper is exactly that. Old hotel and it looks the part. Plenty of parking and free wifi is nice. Room was pretty worn but for $45 I wasn't expecting anything fancy. They even have smoking rooms still, not too common these days. Again this hotel is nothing fancy and the price reflects that ( actually I'm puzzled as to how they have managed to stay in business.)  I gave the sandpiper a 4 due to my expectations not being very high. Would stay here under similar circumstances again",August 2013,none,none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,6,358

6 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,This was easily the worst and shortest hotel stay I have ever had,"Well long story short a friend and I booked this room via internet for a friends going away party. First off when we checked in the woman at the front desk seemed to be irritated that we had interrupted her from whatever she was doing , and shortly after that we walked around to our room and were shocked at the smell alone when we first entered. Seriously this place looked like it hadn't been renovated since it had been built. On to the next discovery the was FOOD left in the fridge from the previous guests! not to mention the cigarette burns in the carpet and the rust in the bathroom. The real coup de grâce  was after pulling back the bedspread we discovered what looked to be fleas as well as disgusting stains all over both our bed linens.

The heater was broken, the window was stuck open about an inch and my curtains were falling off. Finally got a space heater at 7:30am. I asked to change rooms as the one I was in was falling apart...and cold. I was moved to a room that was far worse than the one I'd left. There was a board covering a broken window, it was dirty inside, the headboard was removed (if I'd only known then that bedbugs live in headboards & wood!) and there were patched holes all over the room. I reluctantly went to sleep...the board in the window freaked me out! I woke up a 4am and saw little, tiny, hard-shell things with what seemed like 4 million legs, crawling on my legs (had",November 2008,none,Traveled solo,none,2.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,10,358

The people there were lovly and really friendly, Especially Shaunna and Margie , i mean all Margie wanted was to give me towels and we ended up talking for around 3-4 hours ! And shunna was amazing because when me and the family got back at around 9 or 10 i would go straight to the office and chat and would leave untill around 4 am !
