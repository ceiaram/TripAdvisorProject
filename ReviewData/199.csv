Around 9 pm on 02.24.23 a manager by the name of Jesse, the night manager (he confirmed he was the night manager), was completely rude when answering a few of the questions I had during check-in. He stated that he since I didn’t have a previous reservation that he didn’t have to let me or my friend in the lobby while we had an 8 year old with us. He had said he was “being nice” by letting us in the lobby while it was pouring rain outside.   One of the questions I had asked was if it would be okay to pay for the entire stay in cash since it was only for one night. He said that it is not possible to do that, that the stay total as well as the deposit has to be made on card.

The hotel and my room overlooked a trailer park but the good news is the hotel is only a few miles from the beach and has a lot of very good restaurants and interesting shops within walking distance. The hotel room was bigger, especially wider, then most in this price range but the shower head was set at about 5' off the floor making it very difficult to wash your hair. I would have given the hotel a 4th star if not for the electronics, which were by far the worst part of the stay here. At 7 am it literally took minutes for simple web pages to load.

74 helpful votes,83 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Not The Best,I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Costa Mesa after looking for a hotel near the Orange County Fair. I picked this hotel after looking online because it had the cheapest last minute rate which was pretty steep. The location is convenient for those going to Costa Mesa and Newport Beach as it's within a short drive.   The room was nice and in good shape with the exception of the shower which gave me issues. Long story short it would take over 15 minutes of running (California is in a major drought) before it was even hot. The front desk also provided no real solution which sucked.   Overall its a decent place to stay if you don't need hot water :P Although there are much better choices in the OC area.

147 helpful votes,145 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hotel with good value in the O.C.,"The Holiday Inn Express Costa Mesa is one of those great hidden gems you come across by accident.  The hotel is recently renovated and the rooms and property are clean and fresh.  The rooms are of a good size and include microwave and refrig.   The rooms were quiet as the hotel is next to a residential area.  Parking may be tight if the hotel is full and offers limited parking outside and a parking garage under the hotel - Parking is FREE which some similar hotels in the area charge for. The breakfast bar is spacious and has a great offering of breakfast staples, including oatmeal on the go cups which were great.  The only odd part is that the breakfast bar is on the 2nd floor.  The lobby is nice, but is a bit odd and just a waste of space.  Coffee is offered off of the lobby",June 2014,none,none,"Dear No1HotelAdvisor,  Thank you for taking the time to write to us regarding your stay with us recently!

Upon arriving at the hotel I was created by one of the nicest front desk clerks in the industry. The clerk was so kind that when I walked in the musty smelling room I was very forgiving, and decided to give the air conditioner a chance, which works fine btw, but it is one of the floor units so it takes a wee bit longer to cool off the room but it works! I am staying in a room with a single king size bed, the room is a decent size, and bathroom like in so many hotels these days is small but the water pressure was excellent and there was plenty of hot water, a must for a tired traveler.  The king size bed was perfect, I",June 2014,none,none,"Dear Michelle A,  Thank you for your comprehensive review.

Close to a Starbucks and Newport Beach. The smell is only in the elevators and due to a natural spring. Great rooms and good wifi. Will definitely go back, this was our 2nd visit. Totally recommend.

The carpeting in the hallway are brand new and different than anything I have ever seen in a HI Express.  The rooms are all spotless and the beds are comfortable.  In the room having the Directv is a great bonus.  Had about 120 channels to choose from which put it well above most in room entertainment.   There are a couple downsides however.  Parking at this hotel is quite simply a mess.  You have two choices, you can parallel park outside or shoehorn your car in the basement garage with spaces that never met a SUV.  Anything bigger than a Prius is going to have fun with these.  Second in the two times we have stayed here I have never seen more than one person working.

Also close to Newport Beach for nice dinner options in evening.  I've gone back and forth between Holiday Inn Express and Best Western.  Best Western has been consistently better, but always like the IHG points.  But again this place fell short of Best Western.   The place was clean and updated. House keeping and grounds keeping are impeccable!!   Main reasons for dissatisfaction were 1) the guy working the desk the evening was just not welcoming.  Maybe an off night for him (we all have those), but he is my second impression after walking up the building and seeing beautifully maintained grounds/ outside decor!!
