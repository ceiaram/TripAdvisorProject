Is it a bait & switch or honest mistake? There is a Pacific Edge Beachfront listing (which I booked on) and a regular Pacific Edge Hotel. I wanted a beach front room and upon checking in received a really tacky room above the office that didn't even look like ANY pic on the site. The front desk understood how confusing this is and gave me the last room in the beach-front area. Still, this room is in dire need of TLC and attention to detail. The beds are comfy and so are the pillows. That is where it stops. Floors and furnishings are coming apart and the stark white paint with tiny bath is very Motel 6.

While it was not one of their renovated rooms in the other building it definitely felt renovated - also closer to the ocean ! Room was gloriously spacious with a terrific plush king bed.

Even though it is maybe a 2-1/2 star property the beach attendant staff have always made us feel 5 star. I would like to mention , first Carlos Colin. We met Carlos when he first started working there. He is by far your greatest employee that we have had contact with. He always goes above and beyond. He actually really cares about the guest. I will go as far as to say Carlos makes the ridiculous nightly rate a little easier to handle. The other two beach attendants that we had the pleasure of meeting were Cesar and David S.

I booked a last minute trip thru Priceline where I would get one of 3 resorts.  This was actually the one I wanted (so I thought).    First, it looks like a beach front resort.  Pictures are deceiving.  They have 2 buildings that are oceanfront and one off of PCH with the back side of it looking out at a noisy, dirty, disgusting alley.  Since it was an express booking thru Priceline, guess what building I got?  Priceline tells you before check out that there is a resort fee.  What Priceline didn't tell me was that there was mandatory valet for $38.  That was a cost at the hotel.  When I told the girl at the desk that Priceline didn't state that fee, she basically said ""well, it's like that at all the resorts here"".  This was a lie.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,On The Beach,Been coming here before it was Pacific Edge Hotel. I appreciate the fact I can have a real ocean front room and walk 30 feet onto the beach. I understand it’s an old funky layout and rooms haven’t really changed for 20 years. Here I feel relaxed with my ocean view in the morning and relaxing at the beach with complementary beach chairs ext. it’s an easy walk down the beach or to town for dinner or snack. Two restaurants on the property if you want to stay close. It’s a bit pricey for the room quality but the view and beach access is what I’m here for. If you want to sit in a nice room go to the Ritz and pay 1500 a night this is not your place. I will continue to return every year as long as it here and they don’t go over board with the cost.

The rooms were in no way a resemblance of the rooms pictured on the website of the hotel. My room looked like a tired dorm room with no closet doors, no extra deadbolt lock on the door, missing window locks, very sloppy paint job, crooked light fixtures, and dirty floors. Others in my group experienced getting room assignments and walking in on guests already occupying rooms, boarded up windows, and uncleanliness.

Until they tell you how to get to your room.","Not sure where to begin, It’s like they took a bunch of apartments or motel 6’s and called it the pacific edge hotel. It need to be pushed over the edge of the cliff. To get to your rooms you will need the map and hiking boots. You may get lost and end up in someone’s home if your not paying attention. First, go down the elevator, take the send right, down the stairs, across the alley, go 1 block, make a right, down 3 flights of stairs.l and your room is on the right.. “can you say that again”… this is not for the elderly or disabled.

Staying at a motel 6 would have been a major upgrade, and I’m being serious when I say this is not an exaggeration or just a disgruntled guest. When we arrived at 5pm our room was not ready and the manager was very rude about it. When we got to the room it was about as run down as my apartment in college for 600 a night. Carpets were ripped place smelled and decor was very old and dated. The only redeeming quality of this hotel is the location - it’s on a great beach in laguna.

What i got was a run down room outdated with tripping hazards. when asked to change rooms I was denied even when i told them about the ripped carpet was a trip hazard. We stayed in #6 BAHA which now i know why - its like the name is laughing at you BA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. The staff looked at me and my children as we were under qualified to make any request very snobbish and rude. Except they guy who checked us in. The room smelled of cigar smoke. The couch was falling apart. The fridge was not cold and my left overs was pretty much wasted. I was there 1 night with my kids passing through so I guess our accommodation was treated as LOW end service. I have pictures but its not giving me the option to add them.

My wife and I stayed at Pacific Edge on March 27th to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  I booked a King full Ocean View in the Surf tower (#502).  The rate was almost $700 per night.    We have stayed here before but I guess I seemed to forget a few things - and from the moment we arrived I was underwhelmed.    The one saving grace is that I contacted Flowers by the Sea and they brought in a wonderful display that was the highlight of the room.  Expectations need to be lowered here.  It is a motel.  I am not saying this as being spoiled or entitled - $700 was a big hit for us and only get a way in almost 2 years.

Its not a fancy place but a perfect place to spend time with family.  The only place in Laguna where you can stay over the water!  The oceanfront rooms have the most amazing sunsets.  It’s the only hotel in Laguna with beach access.  You can park your car, stay for an entire week and walk everywhere with never needing to use your car.  The deck restaurant is incredible and often frequented by local celebrities.  This is the definition of the Southern California surf hotel.

This is about our 10th visit to Pacific Edge. We come every spring and fall (to avoid peak season prices) PE is an older hotel right next to the beach. We always get an Ocean Front room.

Towels some of the best I've seen in a hotel or home. The bed comfortable.  However - ALL electric outlets for charging of 'phone/tablet or even use of iron are behind tables and require moving furniture.

This one offered beach and ocean views and had a good value/price. I'm glad I only booked two nights because they charge $100 per night as a deposit! When traveling on a budget, that can break the bank for some! We didn't get an ocean view room as we requested.   The room was very small, close to dorm room size. Bathroom was okay but the tub had drainage issues. Water kept gurgling back up during my showers.

My 15 year old daughter came along with me so we could visit aunts and uncles in Laguna woods. Staff was extremely welcoming. Valet was quick and professional and courteous. The only negative I had isn't really a negative. The restaurant is so popular that there was always a wait. So make reservations because otherwise you wait a while. The beach attendants were great.

You are right on the beach or facing the pool or street and you are in walking distance to the entire town of laguna beach.

Yes, the ownership did change hands in June of 2006, from a family run 2 ½ -star hotel to a private ownership, who hired a professional management company to run the operations. We value our long-term repeat guests at Vacation Village and hope to keep you as our guests in the future as we continue to improve the property, guest rooms, service, and amenities.  Vacation Village prior to the change in ownership had not raised rates in over 5 years, even though demand for hotels in Laguna increased over that same time period, and other comparable properties continued to raise their rates. There was a large amount of deferred maintenance and deep cleaning that needed to be completed. The décor was outdated in all the rooms and the wear and tear in the rooms over the years was showing. The location was and still is what drives business to Laguna Beach, and the ‘value’ of the rooms, given their condition, made Vacation Village all that more attractive.   Parking is and will always be in demand in Laguna Beach. Vacation Village Hotel had never charged for parking overnight, however, 95% off all other properties in Laguna Beach do charge for parking. With demand growing and parking an issue, we felt it necessary to implement an overnight parking charge to remain competitive in the market.   Yes, the rates have increased since the new ownership took over last June; however, we are still priced under other comparable 2 ½-Star properties in Laguna Beach. I realize the rate increases seem dramatic to some of our past guests, however we are making improvements at the property daily. The ownership has invested over $260,000 in upgrades to the guest rooms since January 2007. Some of these recent upgrades include new Suite Plus Pillow-top mattresses in the Ocean Front rooms, new pillows throughout the hotel, new linens, towels, duvet covers, bed skirts, throw pillows, draperies, lighting, artwork, re-painting in all the guest rooms, shower curtains, shower heads, new mirrors in the bathrooms, and we have added the luxury brand RUSK bath amenities in our Ocean Front rooms. We will soon change to the RUSK amenities in all of our guest rooms. We have also purchased new balcony furniture for the Ocean Front rooms.  We have added numerous staff at our hotel as well, and have been providing on-going service training to them. We have also upgraded their benefits package, provided new uniforms, and implemented reward and incentive programs for outstanding service. New computers and printers to replace outdated equipment have been purchased so they can perform their job more efficiently and continue to provide our guests with outstanding service.   Our end goal is to provide our guests with a clean and well maintained guest room, an inviting, clean and well maintained property, and outstanding service at every point of contact.   We hope you will continue to choose Vacation Village Hotel as your vacation destination, and will be as excited as I am about the changes we have made, and are making at Vacation Village.
