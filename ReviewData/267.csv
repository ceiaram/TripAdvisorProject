none,3 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Did not stay - misrepresented property,"I booked 5 nights and didn’t stay. Both rooms that I was offered had basic safety issues such as a broken access door (slider to shared balcony), no installed working smoke alarm ( found in a dresser drawer along with hangers and dead bugs) and wall air conditioner with black mold on it. When I returned the key, the staff member asked why I wasn’t staying. I let him know my concerns about safety with the smoke alarm, door and air conditioner. He shrugged and gave no reply.",August 2022,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,267

3 helpful votes,2 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Shady management, avoid this place","It all begins with a rude staff. The staff here are not trained in customer service at all. Expect less than average service in all forms (sanitary included). This is more of a transient rest stop for people living in motels as a lifestyle rather than people on vacation or business trips. Apparently, them dealing with the undesirables they rent to has inspired the level of staff they hire. Avoid this place at all costs unless you are desperate and have low standards.",May 2015,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,267
none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Slice of Heaven,"Let me start off by saying this motel is very clean and is equivalent to the famous Howard Johnson motels. This vintage motel is a flashback of my visits to the Howard Johnson motels back in the 60s. This kitchenette suite was rented for me while I was visiting my family in Tustin, CA. The towels were fluffed upon request, while the toiletries were plentiful. The retro kitchenette was very clean and everything worked well. The bedroom was spacious had plenty of privacy for you and your significant other. The main room had a very comfortable futon, which would act as a luxury couch during family movie time and then later turn into a cozy bed for your admired children. I had plenty of closet space and hangers for my apparel and a lot of room my for my refrigerated goods in the",February 2013,none,Traveled with family,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,5,267
3 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst hotel/motel I have ever stayed at!!!!!!,"This was the worst place I have ever stayed at.  It looked OK from the outside, but what a nightmare.  No ice, TV did not work, dirty, bugs, faulty lighting, no maid service, craby Mgr.  I know this is curt, but I don't want to spend a lot of time on this terrible place.  You have been warned!",January 2013,none,Traveled solo,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,6,267
12 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst place ever,Went to check the place out but got yelled at by the manager. It was like we were bothering her.  I wanted info on the phone service provided because I didn't have a cell phone but she waived me off and stormed away. She was in the back room yelling that I was crazy. I wasn't going to get a room from her even if I wanted it.  I'm not sure what kind of place they operate but I'm glad I got away.,August 2011,none,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,7,267
