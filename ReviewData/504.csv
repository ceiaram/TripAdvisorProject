18 helpful votes,48 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible Hotel,"This is the worst hotel I have stayed at.  First, the place was filthy.  The dirt on the walls and telephone was disgusting.  There was no chest of draws to put your clothes.  There were only four hangars but they were only for shirts.  You couldn’t hang your pants or put them away.  The bathroom had no counter so you could brush your teeth or shave.  The paint on the walls was peeling.  I could go on and on.  In short, the place was a complete dump.  When I moved in the disagreeable manager demanded that I give him a $50 cash security deposit.  What security?  You couldn’t do anything to make this room worse.  Don’t stay here!",October 2018,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,504
3 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Terrible people, they judge you","The hotel owner is not accepting of people of all kinds. This is the lowest class of service and discrimination I've never seen anywhere. They lie about your reservation and decide on the spot whether they will take you or not, it's surprising this business is still allowed to run. It makes sense there are so many 1-star reviews for this hotel. If you don't fit into the default demographic, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. They will not treat you well. Do not take your significant others or friends because they will judge you right at the front desk. I am disgusted that this kind of hotel is allowed to operate.",December 2017,none,Traveled as a couple,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,2,504
5 helpful votes,11 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Ok minus,"We arrived round 18. The reception/office was empty and with no doorbell I yelled ""hello"". After a couple of minutes a man came to help me. He asked if I wanted a smoke or non-smoke room. I said that my reservation says non-smoke. The man seemed annoyed of my reply and repeated the question with a harsh voice. No smiles. Once the check-in was done we got to the room. Old room and old bathroom. Seemed clean enough, but the age of the room made it feel less clean.   The man at the front desk seemed happier at our checkout and was actually smiling then.   Ok experience. Should be more service minded since the rooms aren't too notch.",August 2017,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,504
none,1 contribution,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Not bad,"My ideal hotel has free parking, a firm mattress, quiet, not in a bad area, local to good places to eat and doesn't have paper thin walls. Close to Fwy. Close to gas stations. Not that many creepy people walking around. This place meets my criteria.",October 2016,none,Traveled as a couple,none,3.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,4,504
4 helpful votes,2 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not the best, by far","I arrived here to get a room, for one week and Almost Immediately the manager came out of a door behind the front desk area looking at me strangely. He furthermore began to Address ""Me"" as IF I would be having Crazed Parties. Seriously? I don't plan on going back here, which is good and you have been forewarned. I'm just a Single Mom taking care if my business, don't have Any Time for junk and mess. Period.  And one more thing? The manager also Chose to Charge me a Few Dollars more than what the front desk clerk was charging me. This was a nasty low blow.",June 2015,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,504
