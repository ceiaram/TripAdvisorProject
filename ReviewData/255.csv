none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Beware and AVOID,"We booked a Double Deluxe Queen Bed room but at the time of check in, the lady at the front desk told us that in their system they only see a ""single queen bed"" room instead of the ""double deluxe queen bed"" room that we booked. Even in the confirmation email we have the picture of the room with the double queen bed and a room description "" double deluxe queen bed"" room. When I asked is there a mixed up and is there anything that they can do for me to sort this out, the lady just said this is not their problem and nothing they can do about it. Very inflexible and answer with a tone that ""we don't care about your problem and you need us, not we need your business"". This is just rude this was the first time we came across customer service like this. The weird thing was, we have",November 2022,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1,255
none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Dirty, sketchy, and fraudulent","Do not stay here. This place was very dirty and fraudulent. The sheets were gross and had hairs on them and there was no fitted sheet or mattress cover protecting you from the gross mattress. Bugs in the sink and bathtub. Also, I think there was a camera taped to the TV pointing at the bed. All this was surprising due to the relatively good reviews but I cannot stress this enough; DO NOT STAY HERE.",May 2022,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,255
60 helpful votes,118 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Large room and easy to get to Disney.,"The room is pretty basic with a fridge and microwave.  It is on the larger size and there is no smoking, which is nice.  We wanted a lower level room but there were none available so dragging up a weeks worth of luggage was not fun.  We did not get a chance to use the little pool.  The house keeping would wait until we left to come in and clean the room, so that was cool.  It looks like most of the rooms are rented to long term residents, so I think the hotel portion only makes up part of the place.  Uber to Disney was 13 each way, which is only a buck more than the parking fee.",October 2019,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,255
169 helpful votes,693 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Garden Grove getaway,"We visited the Tropic for two nights as a couple in a one-bed room - our son was staying near Disney as part of a school group. It's a small motel, and even though we had no problems parking our minivan, larger vehicles or trailers might find it a bit tight. The room was in very good shape - updated, clean, and comfortable, with newer flooring and a good bed. The pool looked good. If your Seoul is into all things Korean, this neighborhood will definitely appeal to you - if not, many other restaurants and markets are a short drive away. The request for a deposit was a bit odd, but according to my records not acted upon. Also the ""absolutely no visitors"" rule seemed a bit preemptory, but I surmise they've had serious problems with uninvited added guests in the recent past.

44 helpful votes,100 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well Located for Orange County, Odd Management","I stayed at the Tropic Lodge for a few nights in June and have very mixed feelings about my experiences there. The Front Desk Staff and Management of the Motel have made things extremely difficult in regards of room placement/making the requested room available, this to the point of being rude and un-welcoming. The rooms and its facilities have been redone recently and are comfortable. The house keeping staff was friendly and welcoming, while the front desk and management seems to not care much about its guests, which is very disappointing.",June 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,255
87 helpful votes,159 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Simple, clean rooms. Bad location","My husband and I stayed here after a day at Disneyland. It was only about a 20 minute drive. The person who checked us in was nice. The rooms looked much better on the inside than the outside. We could tell the room had been remodeled. There was a microwave and a refrigerator in the room as well. The beds were slightly firm, but we were exhausted. We were awaken by some disturbances outside around midnight. Luckily, there were 3 police cruisers that were called over  to quiet things down. After that  it was hard to sleep. It is not the best part of town, but believe it or not, we've stayed at worse places. The price was still great for the room.",October 2017,none,Traveled as a couple,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,6,255
1 helpful vote,27 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Surprisingly noce,"The hotel facade is not anything to write about but don't let this deter you from booking. The hotel is 25 minutes to OCCPA where we needed to be for a wedding. I picked the hotel because it was reasonably priced and had decent reviews.  The parking lot is free of clutter and the room is extremely clean. The beds are very comfortable and so are the pillows. While the room had a small refrigerator, a microwave, a pretty large TV and excellent air conditioning it didn't have a blow driver and had very minimalistic toiletries which included 1 small soap bar and a couple of shampoo sachet packs. I'm not sure if this was made clear on the webpage when I booked but it is very minor; I just wished I paid attention to it so could have brought my own )I have long hair that needs",July 2017,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,7,255

Comfortable bed, clean, spacious room with minor cosmetic in-room blemishes but nothing to fuss about at all. Flat screen tv with basic cable, decently strong wifi.
