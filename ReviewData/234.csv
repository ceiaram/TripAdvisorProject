We take these matters very seriously as well as our guest’s health and safety which are a top priority for us. All of our suites go through intensive daily inspections after the rooms have been cleaned. We inspect every inch of our rooms and have the head housekeeper inspect the room before we rent any suites out to our guests. Furthermore, all of our rooms also go through bi-weekly pest control treatment and inspections.   The room that you occupied was inspected and let me assure you and everyone reading this review that there was no pest issues at all. We take this kind of issues very seriously therefore we called our pest control company to come and do a second inspection just to satisfy our curiosity. Additionally as you mentioned you had called the health department and code enforcement, both departments came to the property and inspected the room you were occupying and did not find any bugs of any kind especially bed bugs as you claimed. I'm happy to report that the pest control company/code enforcement/health department certified a clean bill of health....meaning that there was no issues whatsoever.   We keep all pest control reports on file for our records.  All reports are available upon request to any guest if they wish to audit the reports to ensure guest satisfaction.  As for your bites...I'm not really sure how it happened and my guess would be it could've happened elsewhere besides this hotel.

Check-in was easy and the front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming every time we walked by. This is motel-style, with all room entrances on the outside instead of in a hallway.

It was a very convenient location and well-priced hotel, with a Vons and Target across the street and a ten minute drive to Huntington Beach.

Knowing how uncomfortable a slepper sofa is, I called and talked with a nice gentleman (not sure of his name...works primarily during the weekdays in the daytime).

First of all, we apologize for the inconvenience you experienced during your stay. We investigated your account and found out that you had booked a suite with king size bed plus a sofabed. Although you booked at Hotels.com but other type of rooms such as two Queens were also available on Hotels.com. If you really needed a room with two Queen beds, we think you should have booked a room with two Queens only. That way, you would have made sure that you got a room with two Queens. At times, guests want to upgrade their room depending on the availability for the upgrades but in such cases, guests are required to pay the price difference in the room types. That is a standard operating procedure with all hotels. Our front desk staff was also just following the same procedure.   Regarding your telephonic conversation with the front desk staff prior to coming to the hotel, we did not find any notes in your account promising you a free upgrade by our staff member. Generally speaking, our front desk staff always leaves some notes about what transpired between the caller and the staff member. Otherwise also, our staff is fully trained not to make false promises to any caller and I am sure there must have been some miscommunication or misunderstanding about providing you a free upgrade.   Regarding pictures, we would like to mention here that all pictures were taken recently and there was absolutely no Photoshop trick applied to any of the pictures. These pictures were taken by a Choice Hotels approved vendor and it is prohibited to apply any enhancements to the actual pictures. Besides this, the pictures are copyrighted by Choice Hotels and can not be altered at all by the hotel owners. That should clarify your doubts that whatever pictures one sees for our hotel are the ACTUAL pictures not the altered in anyway, shape, size or form.

However, I would like to clarify that our wireless service provides a consistently strong connection between the ranges of 2-3mbps with 24/7 customer service support. I personally check the connection 3-4 times a day and it has never dropped below 2mbps, 2 megabytes per a second is still higher than any AT&T or Verizon DSL service for your home. Most DSL companies only offer 1.5 mbps for your home.    There is a maintenance room which is a good 40-50 feet away  from the breakfast area (not in view of our guests) and the door generally remains closed, It just happens that the lobby toilet had to be changed that day therefore it was there by the maintenance room for only a few minutes before it was discarded. the only way you able to see the toilet is to actually walk thru the walk way and around the corner to see it.

In addition as you can see most of guest love our hotel and enjoy staying here. You mention that you stayed at other Comfort Suites in Little Rock, AR and Gainesville, TX, based on my experience it is very difficult to compare properties located in major cities like Huntington Beach California, New York City or Chicago to cities like Little Rock, AR and Gainesville, TX, A lot has to do with property value and cost of expenses.

36 helpful votes,13 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible Experience,"Stayed two nignts.First-- they are not really suites-- just a  room with a waist high room divider. Couch on one side with cushions that are way too soft--ditto for the chairs-- makes it hard to work at the desk. On arrival, lights in bathroom were burned out, light on desk also. They were replaced quickly, but the room was still way too dark. Toilet drained continuously. Bathroom was tiny and the microwave and coffee pot were located on a bath counter behind the door- hard to get to. Carpet was dirty. Sheets were scratchy. Breakfast was so-so-- 5 or 6  tiny tables crowded together in the corner of a small lobby. Fortunately, there are several very good restaurants across the street. On the second night, a family checked into the room above me at 11:30PM. Lots of running,",June 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,393,234

Well my wife and I stayed here a week later and had a terrible time.  The room had MOLD in the corner of it growing on the ceiling.  We weren't able to change rooms because it was a busy night.  So I wrote an email to the company via choicehotels . com and got back a cookie cutter response.  Was not happy with the response or the room that night.

Good room. Good service. Dirty pool and hot tub. 4 miles away is too far. I don't think it was worth my while to stay in Huntington Beach at all ! Pay for everything.

And the front desk was most disappointed, we asked for towels, and the answer is you have to go get it yourself!

The night attendant wasn't very pleasant at all.  The other parties we were with had checked in before us and we had a hunch that they were out buying their own sheets to sleep in that evening.  We kindly asked for their room numbers and were given them without any question as to who we were in relation to them.  The attendant even knew their wherabouts!  He told us that they were out to dinner at Marie Calendar's across the street!  This place calls themselves a ""Suite"" hotel?  Hmm...I think it's more of a health HAZARD.

When we called to get extra towels, we were told that they could not be brought to us, as there apparently was no other staff besides the one man that checked us in. Therefore, we could have the towels if we came down and got them. NOT convenient!!! We also had another group meeting us and when we asked if it was possible to be put nearby one another, we were told that that would not be possible.

The location leaves much to be desired because it is around 5 miles away from the beach - you will definitely need a car so you can drive around to places you need to go to. But other than this, the mini-suites are actually clean and more than livable - no nasty smell inside the room during my entire stay. The complimentary breakfast is nothing much to crow about, but hey, self-made waffles, muffins, bagels, pastries, banana, plus coffee, tea or juice ain't bad to start the day right.
