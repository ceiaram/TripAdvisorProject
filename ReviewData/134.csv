However, there were a couple things that seemed a bit odd. Near the ice bucket were two water bottles that were 3/4 full and had previously been opened. They were there the entire week. Also - on my second night there, I went back to the room and went to take a shower. I noticed that my shaving cream, placed in the shower the night before, was missing. This is super strange as everything else was where I left it. I'm not sure if it somehow fell and got mixed up with towels, or what.

Regarding the folio that was provided to your room and the parking fees, these are very common practices with the hotel industry.

However, there were several issues that collectively made my visit to the Wyndham less then ideal: First, when I booked my room, there was no mention of the parking fee which was an additional $18 per vehicle, per night yet there was no Valet they advertised. Then, the room had been paid for in advance but after check then was a hold placed on my card for the entire 2 night rate plus the $75 deposit. When I questioned the front desk they could only confirm the $75 deposit but had not record of the additional hold.

Though these fees are listed on our website, we find that guests that book through other channels are not always notified of these charges.  We are working with the various third party reservation sites in an attempt to make sure this information is shared.  We recently eliminated the valet parking services and are working to make sure all booking channels are updated.  I’m also sorry to hear about the issue with eth deposit.  Though we release deposits at departure, some backs can take 3 to 5 days before they complete the transaction on their side.  Lastly, I’m sorry to hear that the toothbrush was not recovered.

We expect friendly, welcoming and helpful staff, which the Wyndham certainly had.  We expect a well appointed room, clean and up to date, and I have no complaints in that department either.  In one resect, the Irvine Wyndham broke the rule of inverse inclusion practiced by luxe hotels.  Normally, in upper level accommodations, the more you pay, the less is included in the room rate.  The Wyndham defied that by including Internet access in the room rate.  That's about it.  Self-parking was $18.00 per night.
