7 helpful votes,8 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Surprise Next to Disneyland,"Our trip to Disneyland was to celebrate our granddaughter's birthday.  In the past we have stayed at one of Disney's properties but decided to go with the Holiday Inn as it is next to Disneyland (it seems necessary to say that our usual Disney hotel was under significant construction and there were no guest services being offered). The location was perfect and we were able to use a door to door bus ride provided by the city for a small fee (a real bargain for multiple days).  The room was tight but comfortable and clean enough. The reduced cleaning schedules brought on by covid is taking its toll on hotel rooms (we have seen this everywhere in the past 2 years). However, the housekeeping staff are great.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom animation suite since we’re 4 adults and 1 early teen, and the decor and extra space started the vacation positively for everyone. The rooms were very clean and the decor was amazing, with Cars, Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. It appeared to be recently renovated because I didn’t see pictures online that matched this. Unfortunately, my wife only recorded video and TripAdvisor won’t let me upload screen shots from that video as pictures so I can’t share how great things looked. Another plus is that each bedroom had a bathroom, and the bathroom sinks are separate from the shower areas so 4 of us were able to get ready for the day at the same time.

If you're in Anaheim for another reason, you might look elsewhere for a more comfortable and updated place to stay. We stayed 4 nights here at this hotel because of its proximity to Disneyland (it says 1 block, but its closer to 1/2 a mile, walk).

In regards to your comments, no hotel will allow the guests to leave their pet in their room while they go out to Disney.  In those situations, there are plenty of kennels nearby where you can leave the pet for the day.  In leaving the pet at the hotel all day without someone taking them out, they are more inclined to go to the bathroom in the guestroom which you, as the guest, would be charged for and possibly chance of damage to the room.  In the times guests have tried leaving their pet in the room without supervision, pets have been known to cause disruption to other guests.  These restrictions are in place for the pet's sake, for you to avoid any cleaning or damage fees from being assessed and for our other guests who are staying with us for a comfortable enjoyable non-disruptive stay.    Unfortunately, we do not offer free water at 11:45pm when all the outlets are closed.  Guests can choose to purchase water from the vending machines or at a nearby store.  We offer options to our guests.    In regards to cleanliness, our scores and multiple positive comments say that we do a very good job in regards to cleanliness of the hotel.   We are not perfect but we absolutely work at ensuring the rooms are cleaned properly pre-COVID or during and if there are issues, we address them right away.

The hotel was good for distance to Disney, a bit more than 1 block… about 15 – 20 mins walk to the main gate. The good thing was that the hotel is located next door to the Disney parking building so you can take the free parking shuttle tram from the main gate to the parking building and then it’s not such a walk.

The sink is actually in the room kind of like a '60's era Travelodge and the bath area was tiny.  The beds were somewhat comfortable.

I know when you have a favorite place that you prefer to visit, it is pretty hard to switch things around and try something new, but thank you for keeping open minded and giving us a try! Our location is a special one to say the least. The positives with the location is it is away from all the congestion of the Disneyland foot and vehicle traffic off of Harbor, making it a bit quieter in the day and night, but being in the Disneyland area does tend to get noisy, especially with all the families that come around. We do try to keep a strict rule of no noise after 10PM, so if our guests ever have a problem with noise after 10PM, the front desk will help out when notified.  I would suggest the next time you visit us to give one of our suites a try. I am sure that our Family Suite (2 bedroom and living room) or the 1 bedroom suite will definitely give you the experience you were looking for. Both of these rooms do come with a fridge and a microwave, and our Family Suite has 2 bathrooms (1 for each bedroom). We have had a lot of comments regarding our standard rooms not having a fridge and microwave, and we are addressing that. We hope to get at least mini-fridges for all of the rooms some time in the future.  With the ART shuttle, it is a great tool for our guests to use. Although we do get some complaints about their time schedule, the one thing that guests don't know about it is that you can use it like any other public bus transportation. The $4.25 ticket that you purchase can be used to go to a couple of malls, Disneyland, and soon to be added Knott's Berry Farm (much cheaper than any taxi fare). The times are for the most part based off of Disneyland occupancy, but they usually take no longer than 40 minutes.  We hope that you will give us a try again in the future!

Loved the stay- Perfect for a short trip only for DIsney,"Disney Land was our second stop after Vegas and we were very happy with the location of this hotel. It was right behind the main entrance to the park. Upon checking in, the front desk was friendly and was very accommodating. They provided us with whatever we asked and also increased our room limit for breakfast. We got upgraded to a suite and we loved it. It had a kitchenette and nintendo video games (pay per use/game). The whole concept of having $20 per room for breakfast is something that is totally beyond me. Each entree in the menu starts at 7.99 and goes up to 15.99. $20 is too little for 3 people and they increased it for us to $40.

Rates with the anaheim hotels (especially the Good Neighbor Hotels which this is one of) are season- higher at times and lower at others. I have seen peak rates for non discounted rooms at 120+ a night for this property.   There are basic rooms and there are ""suites"". We contemplated upgrading to a ""suite""- I called the hotel after pricing around and they said we could upgrade for $60 a night (an actual cost of $120 a night, which was a $40 break of the price at the time). Bottomline, we paid $56 a night via priceline- and that was a *fabulous* rate. In fact, overall it was a terrific value.

Decor was nice, looked recently upgraded.  Didnt eat at the restaraunt, as other reviews were negative but pool area was nice and kids had a great time in it.  Nice and close to Disneyland, recommend taking trolley- it was nice to come back to the room in the afternoon and take a break ( and let the kids swim) and then go back.
