No worries because we look after each other for where to get the best deals (already one up on that, just ask nicely, and honestly you will be heard. Also close enough to walk to that big ol theme park and has a pharmacy/liquor store right in limping distance for those sore legs and arms from frolicking. Say hi to Maria, she keeps what you have in good hands, and cleans like nobodies business. Loved my day, Jim",May 2019,none,Traveled with friends,"Hi Jim,  Thank you so much for your wonderful review.  We do everything we can to have a clean and comfortable stay.

none,6 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Clean convenient stay,"We were just looking for an inexpensive place to stay one night near Knott’s park, and this fit the bill. Walked to the park easily, friendly checkin, and the room was recently updated and very clean. I liked the laminated floor - easier to keep clean, no stinky carpet. Very pleasant stay.",October 2018,none,Traveled as a couple,Thank you so much for the wonderful review,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,366
9 helpful votes,13 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Do NOT Stay here with your kids,"I’m pretty sure this was one of the more disgusting filthy run down places I’ve ever tried to stay in.  Tub wouldn’t drain, long black hair all over the bathroom from prior guest.  Fabric on chairs FILTHY.  I’ve bought paper towels thicker than the bath towels.  Ice machine out in general area for any homeless guy to walk by a pee in.  Area sketchy a best.  I’m also fairly certain it’s one step above renting by the hour and I can’t confirm but I’m also quite certain a drug deal of some sort happened outside my room at 3am.  I had prepaid for 3 nights, after a mere 10 hours there (we checked in at 10:30pm exhausted, left at 830am) we asked our 3rd party booking site to terminate our next two nights and get our money back.  Which they did. We moved to a MUCH nicer place for about",March 2018,none,Traveled with family,Sorry to hear about your stay.

none,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Service And Updated Rooms,We arrived at the inn and visually outside it doesn't look that good but upon entering the lobby (office). We were greeted by two smiling face to help us check in and the check in was quick and fast to get us into our room as quick as possible which we really liked. Upon going into the room we had mixed feelings because visually outside wasn't too appealing but upon walking into the rooms we saw that the rooms were clearly updated the Hilton Standards and that the rooms were nice and clean and had a really homey feel to it.,January 2018,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,4,366
none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,New Year's Eve Spectacular at Knott's,We stayed there on new year's eve night planning on going to the Knott's new years eve party and the hotel that we stayed at was minutes away from Knott's berry farm. The staff was very welcoming to us they had new key card system that I myself have only seen on the Disney cruise ship so there keys are updated and not old fashioned when we walked into our 2 bed room they had sparkling apple juice in the room for us and some new years eve celebration stuff for the kids which really was a nice touch as well as Godiva chocolate which was really over the top for us. Next the room was fully updated and felt like I was staying in my own house all-in-all it was a really good experience for us.,January 2018,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,366

I booked here based on the other reviews and generally don't leave  negative reviews. my opinion is its 2.5 stars. its  not horriable not not good.  The Pros 1.) close to Knott's Berry Farm 2.) fairly clean room 3.) has a pool  4.) nice faux slate colored flooring 5.) reasonable close to Disney and other attractions. 6.) paid under $100.it was $90 after tax 7.) the woman working front desk was super nice.  The Cons 1.) owners son (IT Guy / Maintenance Guy) had a condescending attitude and attempted to mislead me by saying it was my device not getting the signal causing the problem when I did a speed test from Fast.com it showed 3.0 mbps which he claimed is great wifi speed. which is NOT. I could not upload a web page in a reasonable and no,August 2017,don't get rooms 8-12 as they are close to the loud pool,Traveled on business,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,7,366
