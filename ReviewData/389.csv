none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Solo business trip,"2nd night out of 6 nights here and I'm already leaving a review. I've never reviewed a hotel before but this is the worst. I'm not picky by any means... But I have to say something about this place:  Tv has no signal. Wifi is basically non-existant. No housekeeping (no new towels or anything after two days). Bed not cleaned after two nights of sleeping in it. No new wash cloths, soap, trash bags,  etc. (I literally had to go buy toilet paper!)   I went to the front desk but there's no night staff to help, which means there's zero security or help if you need something. No phone or other amenities (I.e microwave, hair dryer, clock, dresser, or even a full length mirror)  This is basically an empty room with a bed where you do everything yourself, and you have to supply everything",January 2019,none,Traveled solo,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,389
none,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disgusting place,Although it says no fees cancellation checking out after trying to stay one night is not possible. Human excrement left in the bath had to be cleaned out before allowing my grandson to bathe. Very little to no service. Bad attitude for asking for towels. Told them I was checking out early and would pay for the night I stayed. I had to go back through OVC travel which did nothing to satisfy my concerns. Because I didn't make a formal complaint I have to use other means to try and get my deposits back for 3 nights. Do not stay here or use OVC travel. Rude and untrustworthy family taking advantage of people. Stealing deposits for the sake of laziness.,September 2018,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,3,389
3 helpful votes,50 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,a nightmare night hotel,"I was looking for the hotel stay in Santa Ana CA, and the booking.com website popped up with this hotel.  The price was so attractive with 3+ stars rating, and I was on it.  It was a big mistake ever after checking in this hotel.  I gave a 1 star rated for this hotel due to 0 star rating unavailable.  The room was so dirty, the bathroom door was almost broken and couldn't close, and the environment outside was horrible due to its surrounding in very bad neighborhood.  We were expecting the door got knocked out at night time or the car got stolen in the morning.  We could not sleep at all.",January 2016,none,Traveled with family,none,1.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,4,389
1 helpful vote,6 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,STOP! Don't Stay Here!!!,"The manager, rooms, and parking are horrible. It is cash only even though the website states they accept visa/mastercard. You have to leave a $5 deposit for 1 room key & remote. the beds are hard as a rock and the rooms smell horrible, the carpets are gross, the bathrooms are full of mold. I use singular because I got 2 rooms & both were the same...NASTY! Our room did not get cleaned the 2 days we were there. I had to throw out my own trash. The housekeeper I did see was starring me down because I went from room 103 to room 215, like I wasnt supposed to have a key or something. I had to stare her down right back for her to back off.

We opted for this dump in a hurry before reading all the reviews and ended up looking for a different hotel in the middle of the night with little chance of getting a refund from those scumbags. We arrived late and there was not a single parking spot available. So much for free parking. The streets looked unsafe with beaners driving around revving their engines. An Indian couple runs this place, they couldn't speak enough English to answer a few simple questions. In the tiny office area, a Latino guy stood behind us spitting on the floor. We were given a room key and a TV remote, apparently those items don't stay in the rooms. Upon opening the door, we were overwhelmed by the smell of urine and bacteria.

5 helpful votes,8 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice place,I was visiting family in the area and the Travel Inn was convenient and easy to get in and out. Price was right.

1 helpful vote,11 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible motel...RM: 208,"This place appears semi nice from the outside. Once inside you're greeted with the smell of stale cigarettes and poor cleaning habits. The pictures I provide tell it all... Mold growing inside the broken shower faucet, beware of the scalding hot water here, thank God it was me and not one of my children. The faucet was broken and needed me and my tools' attention.  The black mold growing in the tile grout and sills of the bathroom window was quite off putting. Under the sink were the apparent signs of lazy maintenance and lazy owners. The outdated room was very disappointing. To add to the awful living conditions, the owners, both the male and female, are quite rude and unhelpful. The refrigerator was broken the entire 2 day stay.  As a father and as someone who utilizes the",March 2015,none,Traveled with family,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,9,389

The cleaning service is not so good, you have to request every day that clean the room, because they clean each 3 days.

8 helpful votes,21 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,First Visit,"We stayed at this hotel near the airport for 3 days.  It was a new experience and the hotel was newer and the rooms where clean. The price was reasonable since someone else made reservation. The only thing was strange that on arrival at the airport at  8:30 PM their shuttle did not run.    They paid for a Cab ride and the driver was not very happy because on entering his cab we told him the hotel would pay. during the ride he tried several times to get my to pay, We refused since he was informed on the beginning. The beds where good and the air worked well. The  breakfast was sparse, but the mexican place down the street the food and service are A1. Would visit there again.",September 2014,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,11,389
