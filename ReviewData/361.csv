We booked a Penthouse Loft Suite (2nd and 3rd floor of a 3 story building) as this provided 2 bathrooms and 2 king size beds (which we need as our kids are getting more adult-sized).    The most striking thing was the flooring which was sloping in places and seemed to be missing or having a very thin subfloor throughout based on the amount of 'give' it had in places.  We had to keep on reminding our children to walk lightly as their usual stomping up and down stairs vibrated and echoed throughout the building.

It has reasonably comfortable beds and a good sized room for a family with 2 kids who can share a sofa bed. If you are travelling with two older/larger kids the sofa bed will be WAY too small.

Good for Disney stays.,"We stayed here the entire week of March 16th, 2015 for a trip from North Carolina to Disneyland/CA sightseeing. Staying in a hotel for the entire week with my husband and a very energetic 5 year-old, I was slightly concerned that we would feel cramped and irritable by the end of the week, but I must say that the staff and housekeeping team really made the difference in making our stay a very welcoming one. Housekeeping came by DAILY and made our beds and left us lots of extra clean towels. You must understand the feeling of bliss when you come home from a long day at Disney and find that you can just jump on your neatly-made made bed and relax, and then have clean towels to shower with. What I especially liked was that they even fixed the sofa bed daily for us, and had it all",March 2015,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,91,361
