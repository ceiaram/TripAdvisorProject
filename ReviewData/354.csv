When you walk into the room you literally walk into a closet.  Sparse seating.  They could've put a Larger table instead of a small desk.  On one wall there were 4 electrical outlets.  Furniture looked like they went to good will and purchase it.    Now to the bathroom.  No counter space for the size of the bathroom.  Behind the toilet it looked liked they didn’t finish the base boards.  The toilet paper holder was rusted.  The shower needs to be fixed.  You pull the thing to get the shower going but the spigot was spouting out more water than the shower itself. Water didn’t drain fast enough.   Paint was coming off the ceiling above the beds.

My sister and I had been driving all night and wanted to see if we could check in early just to get off our feet for a little and lie down.

I came back asking if they could at least hold my luggage so that we weren't driving around everywhere with our belongings.
