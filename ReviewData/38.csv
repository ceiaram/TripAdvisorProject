They really need thicker glass windows. On the other hand, the HVAC is quite loud so it covers up the street noise when it’s on.

There are many parking spots that are close to the front door, both inside the gated parking and outside, that are available to make checking in easier for our guests, and I apologize if these were not more clearly marked. I am also sorry that we had run out of the product that you needed in our gift shop. I am quite proud of our little shop, which offers more than you might expect for a small hotel, including, souvenirs, postcards, a decent selection of wine, beer, soft drinks, ice creams, basic pharmaceuticals, candy and snacks. We do not get a huge amount of demand for the product you were in need of, so our stock level is kept fairly low, but I will review and revisit this for possible adjustments to inventory. Again, I am very sorry if your stay was anything less than exceptional and do hope you will reconsider staying with us again.",none,none,none,none,none,none,757,38

I would like to clarify, for the benefit of other people reading the review. We had opted to give you a surprise treat of a complimentary upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite when you stayed previously on a quiet night. This was in order to provide you with a more comfortable stay. That night was quiet, you had booked a standard room at a lower price. The stay you have posted about was on a very busy night when we had a concert across the road at the Honda Center. The price was $60 more that night and we did not provide you with a complimentary upgrade. You received the standard room with one king bed which was the room you had booked. We did explain this to you when you checked in and held an additional room for you at a discounted price until 6pm in case you wished to take it. I have instructed my staff to be sure and let the guest know when we do provide them with a complimentary upgrade, so that there is no confusion.

This last stay was not the same experience.  We did not visit Disneyland in 2015 so 2014 was the last time we were at the hotel and were saddened that the hotel has lost its charm for us.  The biggest complaint: when we made the reservation, we should have been told that construction was taking place in the dining area.  The cook to order breakfast and the chef are the two main reasons why we loved this hotel so.  But, with the construction, they did not exist.  Also, the construction made my allergies flare up due to the dust.  The hotel was clean, mind you, but the microscopic dust that is inevitable during construction was still there.

The online travel agents unfortunately did not have the flexibility to post on their websites so there is definitely a gap we were unable to fill there was well. Our chef is still here, and the breakfast room will be bigger and better laid out, which will lead to an even better breakfast dining experience for our guests. We have also just received a few thousand new keys to replace the faulty ones that you may have used. It would be an awful shame to lose you as a guest, given that the chef and his pancakes are still here along with the cleanliness and quietness of the hotel.

Guests are informed of the $10 per night parking charge in all confirmation letters and over the phone and, when the hotel was under renovation previously this year, the construction was noted on the website and confirmation letters. We are very sorry if this information did not reach you and that the quality of your stay was impeded as a result. We also do our utmost to try to meet the requests of all guests, who are all very important to us, whenever possible. Unfortunately, it does seem that the upgraded room provided did not meet expectations and we do apologize for this. Guests will be pleased to note that the breakfast room will soon be expanding, so, during busy times at the hotel, everyone will be more than comfortable. We thank you again for your candid review.

First, it's RIGHT next to the Interstate. So yes, we heard the freeway noise, even with the TV on. Second, aside from this little pizza place next door, there is literally nothing around here. Nowhere to walk, get some food, drinks, etc...NOTHING. The hotel offers ""room service"", but it actually comes from the little pizza place next door. They do NOT deliver any wine, beer or cocktails.

While I am pleased to read that you found the cleanliness of the hotel acceptable and some of the Front Desk staff personable, I am so sorry that you had a disappointing experience overall.  I would like to address some of your comments. We are a hotel in transition from a more traditional “boutique” feel to a more modern feel. Our lobby and corridors still remain under renovation, but, by the end of May, the corridors will be done and hopefully we will have the lobby finished shortly after that. This involves some rebranding and the use of the term “boutique” is being revisited by our marketing department. I am also sorry that you received accessible rooms. Those rooms are typically our last rooms to sell, but the closet is legally required to have no door. We did have another guest complain about a noise from our elevator so it was repaired immediately. I was also concerned to hear about your sheets and am currently looking into this issue.   Please allow me to extend my apologies for the Front Desk service you received. We have passed on your feedback to our staff to ensure against this in the future. We are working with the ART to improve the reliability of the service. During the busy part of the year it is the best way to get to Disneyland as the shuttles arrive/go every 20 minutes.

While we did do our utmost to locate any and all websites during this stay that may showcase our hotel as accepting pets, we were unsuccessful in locating any mention of our hotel as being pet friendly and this was also not listed on the website where the reservation was booked. The photo included in this review does show a gentleman with a dog, but, if one were to examine it closer, this photo was not taken in our hotel but in someone's home and included in a guest's review as a thank you for a wonderful stay. We do sincerely apologize if this caused any sort of confusion and have passed all of this information on to the corporate office so they can further investigate and ensure all websites accurately reflect our non pet friendly status.   We did understand that it was late and that it would be difficult to secure a new hotel so did agree to accept the pet along with the application of a guestroom cleaning fee. Pet fees are standard at most pet-friendly hotels and, although we are not pet-friendly, we did require a fee application as the guestroom would then need to be specially cleaned in order to prepare it for the next guest.

The wifi was actually recently upgraded (about a year ago) using top of the line hardware and we have also expanded our bandwidth to 100mb. The challenge is that it is secure, so that every time you leave the hotel, you need to log back in to the system. A device may show as connected to ayres but when the device leaves the hotel and then comes back, our security requires another login using the code. This is the main reason that our guests feel the system is not working. The system shows that it is connected to ayres, but they have not logged in so they are actually using data and not the wifi. We have double checked the system and it is working as it should. This was actually just brought to my attention so we have also spoken to our guest service agents to make sure they are able to address the issue head on. Once logged in the system does require another login after 24 hours, so this may also create a loss of connection. I hope this addresses your concerns. If it doesn't then maybe we can talk and look at whether there is another issue involved. Either way, I am confident that we have a very strong wifi system and hope that you will return to reap the benefits of it on your return. Thank you for your kind comments regarding the hotel and I look forward to hosting you again.  All the best,  Marcus",none,none,none,none,none,none,1370,38

Please let me address the issues that were brought to light. We do offer our guest's the opportunity to guarantee a room for early check-in at a fee and the opportunity to stay longer as well. We have many guests who check-in early and do not pay a fee, understanding of course that there is no guarantee of the room being available. In the past, late check-out was restricted to around 1pm depending on how busy the hotel is. The guarantee fee gives us the resources to be more flexible in housekeeping, but I do apologize if this in any way impeded your stay. We do charge for parking now following a trend in the area. Surprisingly, given our location next to the Honda Center and Angel Stadium, we are one of the last hotels to do so. I certainly understand that it is frustrating to see a charge where before there was none. Please note however that our parking charge of $10 plus tax is between 3 and 5 times less than charges found at similarly located hotels. I am also so sorry that you were disturbed by the refurbishment project. Our refurbishment hours of operation are between 8 and 5 with the heavier work typically being scheduled after 10am. We have been largely successful in meeting requests for guests who wanted to sleep in and would therefore need a room away from the refurbishment. I am sorry that this was not arranged for you.

The manager on property did advise you of this, but I apologize if this information could have been  better communicated. The aim of a loyalty program is to reward loyalty and often times third party sites maintain their own rewards programs to encourage bookings and loyalty to their own sites, so only awarding points for bookings directly with the hotel is standard industry practice. We are essentially rewarding members for going directly to us, either via our website or by calling us directly. I will definitely work with my team to ensure this is being more accurately explained to our guests upon enrollment.   Finally the price. Rates can vary by day depending on events in the area and demand, and this rate was higher than a guest might have paid on another day. The Ducks were playing (and sadly losing against) the Lightning across the road from us which draws a lot of demand and drives the rate up, but there was also a large convention in town so the city was sold out. A report for that week showed competitors were selling rooms at a higher rate than us, but I apologize if our rate was not ideal for you.   I hope you will reconsider staying with us again.

The beds were firm and comfortable. The rooms were clean and well appointed. Everything was in good repair. The pool is small but quite nice as is the workout room. The free wifi appeared to be strong everywhere. You do have to login every 24 hours. The included breakfast has a continental portion and a hot portion. The hot portion has limited choices that change daily but done by a friendly and accommodating chef. Their is no on-site lunch or dinner but plenty of choices nearby. The shuttle to Disney is every half hour and is a small additional cost but be sure to check the schedule ahead of time to minimize the wait.

We chose to stay at the Ayres on our trip to Anaheim on account of its location and its splendid reviews, but could certainly have stayed at another less expensive hotel (more on this as you continue to read).  I do not mean to suggest that the Ayres is expensive, per se; it just turned out at the time that we needed a room for a family of five and they did not have any rooms that would satisfy our need (their guestrooms are only equipped to handle four guests and they do not provide roll-away beds).

That room has just one king bed and most families use the rooms with two queen beds so it is rarely an issue.

I would like to respond to your comments regarding the hotel. Our hotel was built in 2001, so we are aiming at a traditional style, rather than trying to modernize an old hotel. We have updated the rooms recently, bringing in new phones, alarm clocks, bedside and desk lamps, flat screen TVs, desk, desk chairs, dressers, fridges and microwaves as well as a massive upgrade on our wi-fi system. However we will continue to maintain a traditional style as so many of our customers enjoy this particular look.  As you can imagine I was horrified that you felt you were treated poorly due to the colour of your skin. I can assure you that this is the first time in my 6 years of management at the hotel that bigotry has been suggested. While Mai can sometimes be somewhat brief and businesslike when there is a lot of people waiting for her attention, I have never been given cause to believe that she is any way prejudiced and I am certainly sorry that you had that impression. I would be interested in discussing this with you. Please feel free to email the hotel with your contact details and a good time to call.  I am sorry that our hotel did not meet with your expectations and that you were not made to feel welcome. That is, of course, not our intention, and we are very disappointed to hear of your experience.  With best regards,  Marcus Collins General Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,2255,38

I would suggest that your experience was unusual and specific to that weekend. It was the first weekend that the ART (Anaheim Resort Transit) had run a different scheduling system, and despite some exhaustive training, the drivers were confused and made several mistakes. That system seems to be working very effectively now and has addressed previous systematic issues with scheduling. In fact I would say that the shuttle is running more efficiently than ever before. I hope you will reconsider returning to stay at our hotel with the reassurance that a recurrence of your experience is highly unlikely.

It is rare therefore to find a chef cooking fresh eggs, potatoes, sausages and pancakes for so many people.

I do feel I should respond to the question about the ranking as it has been a great reward to us. The hotel has responded to customer opinion removing as many reasons for frustration as possible. We have purchased new dressers to ensure adequate storage space, flat screen TVs and clock radios with ipod docks to address concerns of outdated technology, tripled our bandwidth to ensure adequate internet speed and removed charging for internet to address charges of nickel and diming. Bad reviews are normally founded on frustration. Good reviews are often based on exceeded expectations. Many of our guests respond positively to a more traditional style of room that can normally only be found in 4 and 5 star hotels and a room size that is larger than most who share our price range. We are also fortunate to have a charming group of staff and some of the kindest, most appreciative guests a hotel could hope to have.    I certainly understand why you might have been frustrated by the shuttle. It does see a lot of demand during Spring Break which can make it more busy than normal. We see a balance of responses, some like the convenience of low cost transportation from door to door and are not too bothered about the time, others get frustrated at the time it takes.

We usually stayed across from disneyland  (hojo and fairfield ) for convenience of walking back for  afternoon naps and taking a break from the heat.  But, my friend recommended Ayres.  Also, the great reviews on tripadvisor made me consider it for this trip.    Although there is no shutte to disneyland, there is an Anaheim resort transit that stopped in front of hotel at 8:30 in the morning.  We decided to park and pay $12 at the theme park.  We paid $83 (expedia) so we figure that is a decent rate since most other hotels are charging parking fee, resort fee, breakfast, internet, fridge and microwave.  These were all included at Ayres.

Will recommend to anyone.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2790,38
