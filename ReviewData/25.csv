If you have any children, there will be no privacy.  For us, the main purpose of having a door between the rooms is being able to have your own privacy without worrying about having any minors barge in when they need to take a shower or make a golden one.  Also, keep in mind that you will pay extra for parking.    The breakfast is always the best at Embassy Suites, and as an added bonus, you get a complementary snack or drink every night.    Now, to the ES staff, variety is the spice of life.  Only having those dry pancakes to choose from for 5 days straight as opposed to French Toast or Eggo waffles was a total drag.

It was good for what it was for a couple of days in the Anaheim area. The breakfast was mediocre at best, the coffee would also run out pretty quick, and there was a pregnant woman (she should've been on prenatal leave) cooking omelets for a long line every morning I was there. Also, there was a large crowd of Asian and Indian kids on a SoCal/Disneyland Tour. Probably on a field trip. The only issue I had with that was, there was too many people at once going up on the elevators. And there isn't a convenient staircase anywhere. That's not a good thing.

There were no towel racks in the bathroom for bath towels, only a small hand-towel rack.  How are you supposed to save your towels for another day with nothing on which to hang them?  There was a nice vanity in the bedroom, but no bench/chair for it.  The toilet paper didn't fit the dispenser, so it kept falling off.

I can tell you this could have been one of the worst Embassy Suites I have stayed in over the past 10 years.   Lets start with the rooms - Starting with the check in. I drove up from San Diego with family in tow and stopped here to see if a room was available so we could freshen up and drop our bags before heading into LA. There was not one available but I was given a room number before leaving the hotel. Needless to say that room assignment changed 6 hours later when I returned to the hotel which was a bit annoying. Why not ask me to check in later and not ""commit"" me to a room because I am here - I offered that twice but the staff (although helpful) was insistent.

We already spoke with your father-in-law upon his check-out, and addressed many concerns about the stay, and I believe that we addressed them to your father-in-law’s satisfaction. I can assure you that we take your concerns very seriously and are doing everything we can to make your next stay with Embassy Suites a pleasant one.  I do want to respond to some of your specific concerns, however, just to make sure that they are addressed to YOUR satisfaction. As a blanket response to ALL of your concerns—we are in the midst of a MULTI-million dollar renovation that begins in earnest next month.  We are replacing/renovating virtually EVERYthing in the hotel. Also, I really wish that you had brought your concerns to us immediately so that we may have attempted to remedy them AT THE TIME. We are always willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that our guests are satisfied with their stay. 1.	At no point have three of our elevators been out of service. As part of our renovation process, we have been taking one elevator at a time out of service. I apologize if you had any difficulty getting back to your room because of a delay in elevator service. 2.	Our housekeeping staff is always available to clean rooms, and had we known about any apparent food that was left in your room or about any apparently dirty carpet, we would have been happy to clean the room again, to your satisfaction, or if necessary, to move you to another room, if one had been available. 3.	It looks like your wall vinyl was forcibly removed over the door frame!!!! Not sure when that happened! It was not like that during the last inspection. 4.	We also have a maintenance staff that is always available to fix much of the equipment/fixtures in our rooms, and we would have been happy to fix/replace the security latch that was apparently loose in your room. And, again, if necessary, we may have been able to move you to another room, if one had been available. 5.	While I understand your very legitimate concern regarding possible mold, we were never made aware of this problem, and had we known, we would have immediately moved you to another room and had the room quarantined for removal, which we just did.  As an aside, we are subject to routine inspections and cleanliness ratings by the Orange County Department of Public Health, and you can check our record with the Department. We have always received the highest “A” cleanliness ratings, and have never been fined for any violations, especially not for any rodents infestation, you claimed.  We again apologize for your obvious disappointment with your stay, but we do hope that you will give us another chance to accommodate you and your family the next time you visit Anaheim. We will absolutely do everything in our power to make sure that your next stay is to your satisfaction. Please also keep in mind that we will be undergoing a full renovation during the next 2 months, so we are happy to accommodate you and your family now or after the renovation is complete.",none,none,none,none,none,none,1203,25

If you are traveling with kids, this is the perfect place... tons of ""distractions"" in the hotel to keep the little one occupied. The indoor pool is beautiful, and my kids got a lot of use out of it. The made-to-order breakfast was always wonderful with tons of selections.

All night long that is what you will here. Others in my group faced the metal recycling plant which is located about 50 yards from the hotel. The noise from this place is incredible and all night.

Complimentary breakfast tastes like cafeteria food. Hey it's free and it fills you up for the morning! There is only one small pool and jacuzzi. Rooms are nice but the beds are very hard.

71 helpful votes,29 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,not perfect but good value,"it is what it is, which is a fairly cheap and definitely not perfect hotel, but i thought we got a lot for our money. i second the fact that if you sleep in the living room, the noise is really loud (and the pullout sofa is hard) and there's annoying truck beeping in the back in the morning (i brought along a white noise machine anyway.) also, the bathroom was poorly situated, in the bedroom, which meant anyone in the living room had to wake up the bedroom people to come in. but you could fit a lot of people in the room, the breakfast is the best free b-fast i've ever had, we liked the reception at night, the pool looked cool and the management was very helpful and very nice.  the lobby was nice to look at. and the price was right.",May 2005,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1639,25
34 helpful votes,3 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Hotel - Terrible Location,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, booked through Expedia.   The hotel is described as Embassy Suites Disneyland and I mistakenly booked this hotel instead of the Embassy Suites Anaheim South which is only a mile from Disney.   This hotel was 6 miles from Disney which is fine as there is a complimentary shuttle bus to and from the hotel.   Please be aware, however, there is nothing in the surrounding area at all and the hotel overlooks the freeway on one side, a scrap metal yard at the back and building work on the other side.   The hotel itself is very nice inside and the staff can't do enough for you.   If you're not interested in the scenery and are not spending too much time in your room then the hotel is fine.

We did not have any problems regarding bed quality and the front staff were very professional.

However, the free, convenient shuttle makes up for it.  The ride is really only 10-15 minutes.  The staff at this hotel are very friendly and accomidating.  They were not very busy when we were there so the shuttle driver offered to drive us anywhere we wanted to go in Anaheim!  The rooms were great, and the breakfast buffet and managers cocktail reception make this an excellent value.  The pool was warm and the hot tub very hot.   We will return here again.

We were going to Disneyland and I don't think we could have found a hotel farther away even though they said they were just a few minutes away. The shuttle service was definitely lacking and was a pain during our entire stay. Ditto to what the previous person said about the recycling (?) center. It looked like a gigantic dump! Then on the ""quiet"" side there's a man-made river of sorts that didn't smell so good. Oh and right down the road a trash dump place that you could smell if the breeze blew in the hotel's direction. Disgusting. Why they built a hotel there with a freeway on one side, dump on the other, stinking river on another I'll never know. Also you can hear a lot of noise in the front room of the suite.

But what a waste of money:  1. The mattresses are Motel 6 quality; I don't think they were even old and worn, just so cheap that they were very uncomfortable. That and the parade of flat pillows and wafer thin sheets makes for no sleep.  2. Did they forget to tell you? there is a large recycling facility on the east side of the hotel right next door. FYI they begin their dumping and crushing operation at 5am so no need to set you alarm clock since you will be up. We even stayed in the south tower which is the quitest since the North tower overlooks highway 91.  3. They only wash your sheets every 3rd day unless you specifically ask or put the card on the bed.  4.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,1645,25

We were in Anaheim for the Disneyland Grad Nite party, and we stayed at Embassy Suites. The girls took over the fifth floor, while the guys took the fourth. It was a great idea to stay there, because the teachers and chaperones could easily spot a student of the opposite sex walking on the wrong floor. I think the hotel was beautiful, both on the inside and the outside. I loved the waterfalls inside, it gave it a very peaceful feeling. Something else that was nice, was the fact that there were two phone lines in each suite, and we could use them to call anyone else at the hotel.

This meant the hotel rooms were in the low 60's.  This hotel has a unique heating and cooling system whereby the hotel rooms must either have access to cooling, heating, or nothing. After being cold our first night, we asked about the non-operational heater before our second night. We were told they did not have the heater system on and they brought a portable heater to our room. I placed the portable heater in the bedroom to keep my wife warm. However, as the portable heater was noisy, it kept me from sleeping well. So, I went into the living room. However, without a heater, it was very cold in the living room.
