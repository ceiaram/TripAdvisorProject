13 helpful votes,11 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sorry, I just can't.","Group of friends and I stayed here earlier this month for a wedding in the area. First red flag is that you have to call for a room. Like someone else mentioned, I cried when we first got there. Depressing place. Felt weird dressing up for the wedding then walking through the complex. Weirdos living there with their doors wide open and their mess all around will stare at you any time of day. Did not feel comfortable sleeping under the covers or using any of their water. I did muster up the courage to brush my teeth, though. This place is just depressing.",August 2014,none,none,none,4.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,462
3 helpful votes,9 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Close to Beach,I want to thank the owner Song for making my stay enjoyable. We did a remodel & needed a place to stay for a few months. The staff is friendly & helpful. Close to stores and beach with good price for suites in the beach area. So if visiting Huntington Beach and need a clean place with kitchen(can get supplies just ask) pool and close to the beach this is the place for you. The best price in town.....Many thanks.....Betty,March 2014,Choose a room on 2nd floor facing side street,Traveled as a couple,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,2,462

Walking around the place reeks of cigarette smoke from all the low-life staying here. The place seems really old, although the rooms are decent... fair size, nice enough kitchen (but no supplies...pots, pans, silverware). Walls are thin, which is a drag when they rent the adjacent room to 4 drunk lowlife that are up laughing and partying past 3:30 AM... and I could hear every word. Also, they told me that if you are staying for the week (which I did to get a decent rate) they told me that room service is provided 1xweek... which translates to no room cleaning.  In any case, this is not a holiday destination, so if you're on vacation, don't waste your time here... you would cry when you",December 2013,"Total crap shoot, and will depend on who you get in the adjacent room(s)",Traveled solo,none,2.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,3,462
14 helpful votes,28 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Ok for the price,Well.... You get a spacy room with a kitchen and a huge bathroom for a $100 a night. That's ok.  What could be better is the service: it should clean the kitchen and change the linen more often.  The pOol is sutuated next to the street.. But there is a pool!  Would be great if they would provIDE more kitchen stuff than just a pan an cutlery.

53 helpful votes,238 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Not worth the price,"Ok so I've read the reviews on the place and a lot of people have said that it's clean and with new furniture etc.  That is definitely not the case, the bedspreads have blood stains on them, the blankets have cigarette holes in them (even though we stayed in a non-smoking room).  The place does not represent the photos on the website at all - it's a complete front.  It is not worth the price paid it is worse then a backpackers - you can hear people upstairs (doing something adults do late at night) constantly.  Not worth coming here - pay a little extra and go elsewhere.",June 2011,Nothing will help sorry,Traveled with friends,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,5,462

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,BEST VALUE IN OC,"Huntington Suites was recommended by a friend who has stayed there many times. It doesn't look like the Ritz but then it doesn't try to be anything it's not. The rooms are nice, spacious as a studio apartment, and clean with fresh matresses and furniture. Each unit has a kitchenette, DirectTV, free internet, and lots of hot water. There's a sparkling clean swimming pool, on-premises laundramat, and plenty of safe parking. There are a variety of stores, restaurants, and a friendly neighborhood bar right across the street. The biggest surprise is the sincerely caring owner (Ms. Song) who makes it a point of keeping you happy enough to come back another time.

4 helpful votes,2 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Motel for the Budget Minded Traveler,"This motel was a real find. We were looking for a spacious room near the ocean, in a safe neighborhood. And we wanted a kitchen. This place was just perfect for us. We rented a one bedroom suite, $100 night but we got a week for $500 (a real deal). The Huntington Beach area is really nice and quiet and has a very low crime rate. This was a concern for me as my son would be with me. The one bedroom suite is spacious. There is a full kitchen including a microwave. This saved us a bundle over eating out. I do have to note; however, that it would have been better if they supplied pots, pans, disher, etc. They do not so we picked a few things up at the grocery store. We forgot a few things, but there is a 24 hour Walgreens right across the street.

16 helpful votes,5 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great for the price,"I've been going to Huntington Beach for the last few years and I stumbled upon this place a few years back.  All of the rooms are suites and have full kitchen and dining areas.  They have weekly rates that are much cheaper than nightly (there or anywhere else) so you end up saving money on accom as well as eating in.  The hotel is older, but kept clean.  The owners did some upgrades last year (painting, carpeting, etc.) and added wireless internet, so my stay in Aug was even better.  About a mile from Main St, so i'll walk in (15 - 20 min) and get a cab back.  Could be closer, but probably explains the reasonable rates, other then that, clean and quiet.",August 2007,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,12,462
