We were given no warning about it.  We checked in and were impressed to its size; it looked comfortable and did not have an issue until we went to bed the first night.   I thought there was a semi pulling into side street.  When the noise did not let up, I got up looked out the window, no trucks outside but noticed water pipes and a control for them next to the pipes.  I deduced that the noise was coming from the unmarked room next to ours--the walls vibrated with the noise of screeching metal.

As part of our vacation visiting family and friends across California, I decided to use my points for a couple of nights at this hotel on Newport Beach.  On vacation we would normally stay at more expensive hotels (Hyatt Regency last time in this area) but I must say that the HI express was every bit as good and in some aspects even exceeded more expensive properties.  With the hotel being small I felt the staff gave a more personal touch from the reception to housekeeping.

This place proved me wrong. Its look and amenities felt like a boutique 4 star hotel. It was one of the best parts of the trip.",February 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,366,99

First, let me start with the good stuff...the hotel has all the things you like in a Holiday Inn Express...free breakfast, small inn, courteous staff, clean and within walking distance of restaurants. On our first morning there, someone entered our room and took my credit and debit card out of my small passport bag, which was zipped up inside my backpack.

Staff is very friendly, gym is adequate, and you are a two minute walk from a Starbucks. 20 minute Uber ride to Irvine and much more affordable than those hotels.

I didn't have a car and I told the girl at the front desk that I needed a cab for the next day at 8:30am.  She said that they work with a company and the cab was there next day ready and waiting for me.  Hotel was very personable and it was a great stay and a great room.  My room was amazing as it was a 2 room suite.  Only issue that happened was the power went out one night and according to some locals, it happens a lot in that area of Newport Beach.  Having a 2 room suite, I had 2 bathrooms.  The ADA bathroom was nice and big with a tall toilet, but the shower was horrible...no pressure at all.  The regular bathroom, the toilet was low, but the shower pressure was great.  Breakfast was satisfactory, stay was very",January 2018,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,370,99
