We stayed for two nights at Hampton Inn Spectrum.  It was delightful because everything was new.  We especially liked the covered parking under the building, but we felt parking was comparatively expensive at $17 per day, making the total daily rate more expensive than it seemed at first blush.  The breakfast didnâ€™t include the widest selection among California Hampton Inns.  The only egg choice was fritatas.  But they did have small Danish and yoghurt.  Our room 441 was lovely: large and quiet with a wide selection of movie entertainment channels on the TV.  The reception staff were all helpful and friendly.  We consider Hampton Inn Spectrum a very good value in an excellent location.",April 2022,none,none,none,5.0 of 5 bubbles,none,none,none,none,none,1,444
