Masks required in lobbies, almost contactless breakfast (which is pretty yummy), and a responsive housekeeping staff helped make this a great experience for my family as we visited a loved one in a nearby hospital. 10/10 would recommend; will be back when in the area.",March 2021,none,none,We are happy to hear about your excellent stay and how our team took great care of you!

100 helpful votes,118 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We really liked this hotel. Spacious rooms!,"We stayed here for a quick Disney getaway. We didn't want to stay in the Anaheim. Instead we preferred an area that was much quieter. We were really glad we chose this hotel. I had never heard of the TownPlace Suites in the Marriott line before. We really love hotels that have kitchenettes and suites, so this was perfect for us. The room was probably even bigger than an apartment I used to live in. If you need a hotel for an extended stay, this one is a good option because of the spacious rooms and tons of storage in the kitchen and bedroom. They have ample plates and utensils, plus you can borrow other items like a rice cooker, BBQ grill items and more.  The area is close to a lot of restaurants, but still very quiet. The only thing that was a little noisy was the AC in the",March 2021,none,none,We are pleased to hear that you really liked our hotel- we liked having you!

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Marriott Irvine Townplace suites,I just want to give a huge rant and rave of Outstanding Excellence and Service to this amazing Trip Stay Spot!!   The stay was an amazing experience from Cleanliness to friendly staff.   Mike and his day crew was so attentive and made our trip as if we were the only ones there with that personable experience.   Maintenance guy Javee was on point with his responding and getting an issue fixed within a couple minutes.  Suji at the Breakfast bar made sure I got everything I needed even though it was a bit pass the Breakfast hour which was an amazing help and Service as my disabled daughter takes a bit if extra time to get going.  The evening gal was so attentive as everyone here and I will definitely be back as one of my first choices of stay for my home away from home 💝💝💝,February 2021,none,none,We are delighted to hear about your great stay at our hotel!

The room and hotel were clean with a great kitchen.  On-site laundry machines, pool and gym are also nice features.  It's centrally located to both I-5 and I-405, and there are plenty of restaurants and stores within a one-mile-driving distance on surface streets.

Rooms are modern with nice kitchenettes, glass sliding door showers, a desk area and couch. The outdoor grill and seating are also nicely updated.

26 helpful votes,24 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Poor Service is not all COVID-19 Related,"At this Marriott and 2 other Marriotts I stayed at most recently there was not a working ice machine on my floor.  This might sem like a small thing, but it isn't so small when you've been on the raod all day and the temps are at or over 100 degrees.  Other than that the room was satisfactory, except that there was not a note pad or pen, and if I had clairvoyance, I would have brought those items from my car in the first place.   But the biggest disappointment is that due to COVID there are still no hot breakfasts to be had at Marriott properties up to and including at least this category which is Marriott Category ""5"".  But what is even more frustrating is that i can no longer even rely on marriott to dispense self-serve Ice Water or a fresh cup of coffee in the Lobby anymore,",September 2020,none,none,"Thank you for sharing your experience.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Employees need training,"This hotel is great! Brand new, modern, good location..  my only one and big issue during my stay was that I asked front desk for a remote control since the Tv in my room didn’t have one..  whoever they sent with the remote, went into my room while we were there without knocking the door!! This created  a very awkward and uncomfortable situation (I won’t go into details) ..  I know it was recently open and they haven’t had proper training.. but from someone like me the has been working for over 15 years in this industry, even if you know the room is empty, you’re supposed to knock the door before going into the room.. just common sense in general..   I hate complaining but I think management should make sure this won’t happen again to another guest.",August 2020,none,none,Please accept our sincere apology for the service you received during your stay.

The fitness room is also a plus. All around the building, it's clean and the staff members are accommodating and friendly. Don't have to worry about hearing a lot of traffic, it sets away from the main road, you don't have to travel far for restaurants or shopping.
