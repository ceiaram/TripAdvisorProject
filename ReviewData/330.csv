We did a very poor job on all fronts during your stay and we apologize for this.  The most disappointing part of your review and experience is that our employees' ability and desire to offer great guest service did not shine through; this is unacceptable.  Please know that we have followed up with our team members to ensure there is an understanding that we cannot be focused only 99% of the time, because if one guest comes to the hotel and isn't given the proper service, then we failed as a hotel 100% with that guest.

We have come across some GPS devices that require updates and if the updates have not been secured, then the address does not come up properly.

Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a bit larger than the standard -size hotel bathroom.  Gym was very good for a hotel in this class.  Food & Starbucks across the street. The bad: frustratingly slow elevators, paying for parking.",July 2011,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.

It's new so it's still very clean. The bathroom door is a bit weird because you cannot let it open. No bath tub but it's okay. It's designed more for a business hotel. Parking is $8 per day for self park and $11 per day for valet park which is weird for Irvine area where it's normally free. There's a small fridge and a coffee maker in the room, as well as hair dryer. It's not for a long stay. There's a pool outside right by the parking lot, to the side of the main entrance which is a bit odd. Normally they have a pool in the back, not in the front/side of the hotel main entrance.",July 2011,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.

Staff was great and this will be my preferred hotel in the area.  One pet peeve of mine is they charge for daily parking and really there is no need for this. They are not alone in the area and this is more of a blanket statement then a knock on the Courtyard.,May 2011,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.

The lobby is the newer updated Marriott style and it is nice and big however that is where the positive remarks stop. First of all they only had 2 elevators that were the slowest ones I have ever been in (and there were only 4 floors). I would've taken the stairs but they were located outside for some reason. There wasn't ever enough parking so luckily they let us park in the valet spots. Once we got to our room it was clean and pretty spacious. I was disappointed to find we only had a mini fridge and not a microwave like the website indicated. There were 3 of us that stayed in the room. We had a king size bed and a couch that pulled out into a bed. The room only provided a sheet for the pullout and when we,June 2011,none,none,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.
