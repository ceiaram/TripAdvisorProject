5 helpful votes,61 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Penthouse! Um, no!","Awful awful place! This is an apt, not a penthouse, not a hotel, not even a condo! The only view is out the front door if kept open. The unit I stayed in had no towels, no soaps, or toiletries of any kind. Furnished with odds and ends, old, second-hand furnishings. The curtains looked new but could see through them. The kitchen was sparsely furnished, a few random things of little use. Master bedroom had a used, stained comforter on it! I seriously considered leaving but assumed I'd have a fight on my hands getting reasonable customer service let alone a refund. So I reluctantly stayed and checked out at about 6:30am. I am a seasoned traveler. I own timeshares, have rented vacation homes and have stayed in one star to five star places. This place is in a category all its own.",May 2019,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,2,468
