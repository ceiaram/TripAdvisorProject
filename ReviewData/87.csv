While technically in Newport Beach it's pretty much at the Irvine border.  The hotel is located next to an office park and gated residential area but does overlook a protected lagoon with a very nice walking trail just steps from the  entrance.  Rooms are all suites with a lot of room.  Furnishings are functional but a bit clunky and pretty institutional.  The gym is fairly basic but does have a Peloton bike.  The restaurant is not very busy but breakfast service is good, including an omelet station.  Marriott platinum members on receive a continental breakfast offering.

If this hotel contained some separate amenities for for gold/platinum members, its would easily be 5 stars.  Without it, its like 3.5 for me.    What am I looking for for Gold/Platinum members.  I'd take a fridge/closet where I can take my keycard and grab some water / soft drinks.  I personally really hate having to go to the front desk to get a water bottle.  It would also be great to have a separate work area so I'm not stuck in my room.  I'm personally ok with grabbing the free breakfast at the downstairs restaurant which was very very good, and in many ways is significantly better than what I would get at most Marriott concierge lounges.

The rooms very clean and nicely decorated (I especially loved the separate sleeping area with french doors that closed) so you could hang out on a couch and chair while in the room.  Featherbed and the down comforter and pillows made the bed very cozy.  (My husband felt the bed was too soft, but it was perfect for me).  Others in our family had a murphy bed in their rooms that were comfortable. Pool area very nice and water was perfect temperature. Nice patio chairs throughout the courtyard provided nice quiet areas to hang out while waiting for family.

They ended up giving us the $170 a night room which saved us a bit but not what I was planning.  We ended up viewing a time share nearby to earn points so I could stay on budget.  It's not the greatest of locations as you have to drive everywhere.  The layout of the room was exceptional but I think that is more of a reflection on Marriott.   The stay was good but I certainly wouldn't pay full price.  Parking was $14 a day and internet was $10.

Check-in was OK.  Room was a nice layout, but needed some serious housekeeping; dirty shower but the bed was fine.  Not much of a view, but didn't expect one when using reward points.  Requested a roll-away when I booked the room and at check-in was told it was in the room.  Took two phone calls and over 2 hours to finally get the roll-away.  Went to the restaurant to pick up several desserts to take back to the room and was ""greeted"" by a host with an unpleasant attitude.  Received rather small portions for the price.
