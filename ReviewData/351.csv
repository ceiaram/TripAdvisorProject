Everything was clean and in good working order. - The proximity to Disneyland (10-15 minutes) was terrific. So easy and quick to get to the park. - The grab-and-go breakfast was adequate (apples or oranges, granola/oatmeal bars, coffee), but made for great Disneyland snacks!

She was staying with her team, and  I wanted an inexpensive place to stay, where I could make my own food.  Couldn't be happier with the Extended StayAmerica Orange County.  Room was spacious, clean and had a kitchen!  I loved the laundry facilities, because we were traveling for a week before so I could launder my own and my daughter's clothes for the rest of our trip.  Loved the convenient location to the freeway.  There is a Starbucks nearby, for any coffee needs not met by the cofffee pot in the room.  The setting is a business park, so the neighborhood felt very safe.  I was so comfortable here.  Couldn't believe the low price!

26 helpful votes,43 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Clean room but bad checking / houskeeping,"This was much better than my stay in their Huntington Beach property. The rooms where nicer and newly renovated but the checking got messed up really bad. I was very clear with my online reservation and left detailed notes in the comments box and special requests. I needed two double rooms to accommodate my mother in law and all of my kids. When I got there at 5:00 PM, the desk informed me that ""Sorry. Housekeeping never cleaned your room and they left for the day so I have to give you a different room with a Queen bed.""  What?  We never cleaned the room for you?  They also kept asking if I had mentioned what I needed when I made the reservation. So there is obviously a communication breakdown between the corporate reservation system and the actual location. No one even looked",July 2012,none,none,"I recently received a copy of your review of the Extended Stay America Orange County - Anaheim Hills.  We take great pride in offering a clean, comfortable room at an affordable price, so I was happy to read your comments about your accommodations.

We have chosen bedding that we think best fits our customers' needs, and we continue to look for new ways to satisfy everyone's sleeping preferences.  It's not common that we get the sort of feedback you provided, and although it is discouraging to read, it will help us make our hotel even better in the future.
