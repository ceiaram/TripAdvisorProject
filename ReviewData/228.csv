So, when I started noticing problems, I decided not to ask for another room.  I've stayed at Motel 6s, so I knew that the spot next to the window usually has a table and chairs. My room didn't; it was just a big empty space. I was alone, so I didn't really need the table; I sat in the one chair along the desk at the side of the room. I went to plug in my computer, and... there was only *one* free outlet in the entire room -- except at the bathroom! (See the photo.)

Although the COVID-19 situation has caused a few inconveniences, such as no room service (one must maintain one’s own room, yet fresh towels and sheets are always available at the front desk, all one has to do is ask, brooms & such are also available if need be as well) and no pool & jacuzzi access, the time spent  here can still be jubilant and productive.

My stay at the Santa Ana location was by far the best stay I have had yet out of 30 locations. The staff was both courtius and prompt in service. Keep up the good work. Its nice to know you have a clean safe place to go back to after work,February 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,42,228

We contacted the front desk, but the noise continued. It was a terrible night. We asked for a refund but were denied. I contacted Motel 6 headquarters and they said they would check into the matter. I never heard from them again.",November 2010,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,43,228

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good for price,"Room was clean. No significant noise issues. (though would be quieter if door sweeps were installed) AC worked fine. Predominantly Hispanic neighborhood; knowing a little Spanish helps in the nearby businesses. Good for the price. I would happily stay here again, even though I know very little Spanish. ;-)  Neighborhood is pretty dead after 9pm.  Nothing happening to east, for at least 3 miles.  However, there were a couple of Hispanic bars and eateries within 4 miles to the west. There is a delicious taqueria about 3 miles to west that is open into wee hours of morning. Other than that, the 7-11 stores become crucial after 9pm.",July 2009,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,45,228

Moved down the road to Motel 6 (early in the morning and they let me check in) into a newly renovated room which was very nice. Front desk people were very helpful, which relieved the anxiety and frustration from the earlier motel experience. If you are looking for a good value and a clean room stay at this Motel 6.",May 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,46,228
24 helpful votes,4 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,better than most in area,"Made a reservation over the internet and got a good internet price.  Really very basic (bring your own shampoo) but very clean and comfortable room.  Corner room #200 is non-smoking, with a windows facing two directions.  The desk people are friendly and efficient.  If you are on the road and have no resevations they have available a convenient Motel 6 directory with maps that you can carry with you to call ahead.  This saves time and energy trying to find a place for then night.  I was surprised by how well Motel 6 is run since it has been under new ownership by an international hotel chain, Accor.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,47,228

I am not sure why but the hotels or resorts are pretty expensive in Orange County. Although there are no hotel of service or resort level of room, this Motel6 is pretty good already over all. So if you want a cheaper place and a clean room to stay, I would recommand you this one for sure.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,48,228
