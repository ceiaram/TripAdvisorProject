We had coupons from room saver and really got a great deal!  Our son and his family stayed in the next room.  The rooms were clean and quite nice.  They offered more than the other motel we stayed at in Buena Vista (nice breakfast, in room coffee, iron, clock).  At first, we had a hard time finding the place because you can pass it up very easily.  It is almost across from Doheny park.  The desk clerk was nice enough to let us look at the rooms first and get us adjoining rooms with door entry between them.  It was quiet and cozy.
