They have big TVs with Netflix, Prime, Youtube, and the rest of the streaming services provided by Roku, other hotels usually don't have that.  They even have a pull-up bar inside the number which is great because I like to work out.  The beds were comfortable and kitchen was nice. Bug fridge and good shelves.

none,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lovely hotel, thoughtful touches and gorgeous beaches","I loved everything about this place! Lovely, accommodating staff, tasteful, spotless rooms and so many thoughtful touches — including beach chairs, umbrella and towels. The beaches — a short and truly beautiful walk across the PCH — are nothing short of spectacular, and the sunsets are out of this world. I grew up going to East Coast beaches and cannot get over the West Coast sunsets. Bonus: local seals frolicking on the beach, and gorgeous walking/running paths through the public park alongside the Mirage resort.

The location is really wonderful if you don't like to be in the most congested part of town but you still want all the things that make Laguna awesome: walking distance to great restaurants, close access to a stunning beach (Goff Cove - great for swimming, snorkeling, looking at tide pools and watching the sunset), etc. They have a saltwater pool that's heated and really clean. The property has wonderful ambiance and has been recently renovated; the rooms are super cute with great little design touches.

Great Japanese restaurant in the same Plaza as the lodge. Didn't use the pool but looked very clean. A nice area to hang out. Best beaches in laguna right across the street.  And if you want to go into town there is a free trolley stop right out front.

As you can see in the more recent photos (don't look at photos from a few years ago), the rooms have been remodeled and are absolutely gorgeous!  Beautiful finishes, furniture, décor, etc.  Something you'd expect from a very high end hotel!  They provide beach chairs and umbrellas in your room which you can take to the beach.  Parking is easy and right out front (and free).  The pool looked very nice (we did not go in).

Soft bed, beautiful bathroom , great kitchenette.  The decor was modern and tasteful. The television actually had all the channels that a smart tv should have.   The location was perfect!

12 helpful votes,12 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Not quite ready for prime time,"The room was great.  Bright, clean, and charming; updated bathroom with a nice big shower, fluffy towels, comfortable bed (although too soft for husband!).  You are right on the Pacific Coast Highway, so a lot of traffic noise.  Great location for walking across the pedestrian crosswalk and down to the public beach below the Montage Hotel. The manager (owner?) responded to text messages very promptly.  Parking is easy. However, the grounds seemed neglected, or unfinished, and the lack of on-site personnel was a bit creepy.  For these reasons we felt it was overpriced. If you haven't used OpenKey to access your room, it can be a little daunting.

Huge Samsung flatscreen. Memory foam bed that you melt into. Slept like a baby. Huge thick beach towels. Beach chairs. The beach is right across Coast highway. Louge in Adirondack chair outside your room, or relax in the hammock. The saltwater pool is 86 degrees. Pool lounge chairs are very comfortable.

The room, amenities and views were as advertised    or perhaps better than expected. My two daughters, myself and our small dog loved the clean, bright, modern & breezy flow to our room. The management and staff are super accommodating, friendly and thoughtful. Their covid measures suited my needs (cautious).  The bed was magical because I don’t recall ever sleeping so well. What was most remarkable about our stay, was the location.  The beach is just a short, breathtaking, walk across the street through the Montage Resort grounds.

In the complex of CVS you'll also find a pizza joint, Starfish Asian fusion restaurant, La Sirena Mexican Grill, and O Fine Japanese Cuisine. Hotel is nestled between some expensive homes and expensive hotels so it's a gem of a find for the value.   The rooms are nice and newly renovated.
