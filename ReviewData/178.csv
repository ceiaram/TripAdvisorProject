It may have cleaned up since that time but my rating reflects an average review because of the change it seemed to have undergone.  My initial stay was very pleasant. The room was large and squeaky-clean with a king-sized bed and a nice TV, microwave & mini-fridge. The property was obviously acquired from another hotel chain, but very nice. The pool and hot-tub were well maintained and the parking lot had a few boxes near the building but was otherwise okay. Watching planes on their approach to nearby John Wayne Airport from the hot-tub was a serene experience, very peaceful.

33 helpful votes,38 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A nice motel 6,This motel6 was obviously built as some other chain.  The place has 70's design and decor  all over it and the rooms are bigger and a little fancier than a standard motel 6.    I stayed in a second floor room that actually had a sliding glass door and a balcony.    The only thing I would wish for is to have modern flat screen TV's so i can plug my computer in and stream netflix    The location is near two freeways and there is some construction noise but it was not bad.  Parking is ample and easy to get into.  There are several restaurant and small stores nearby.  I think the second story rooms would be difficult for somebody in a wheelchair because the elevator comes up to a floor that is about 1.5 feet higher than the hallways that you reach by a set of 3 stairs.,October 2011,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,45,178

85 helpful votes,78 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Just ok but sketchy,I have stayed at this hotel several times over the last few years.  Until recently it was a Red Roof Inn and had been a fairly well kept property.  Apparently it was recently turned into a Motel 6 and it is apparent the clientele has changed for the worse.  I noticed quite a few questionable characters loitering around the stairs when I arrived after a late night flight.  The room was clean and in good condition and the HVAC functioned properly so I have no complaints inside the room.  In the future I will avoid this location as it appears the neighborhood has gotten marginal.
