158 helpful votes,911 contributions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Ok hole in wall. Satisfactory for basics,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Room was an upstairs unit and quite small, would be very tight for more than 2 persons. Room was very basic with a comfy queen bed, good size flat screen tv on wall, small refrigerator freezer and microwave. Bath area had place to hang clothes and sink counter was big enough to put large travel suitcase along with bath items. Shower was very old and needed to be resurfaced and drain didn‚Äôt drain too good, place was clean with two trash baskets. Room was very dark when wood blinds drawn closed. Nighttime was quiet had no issues with homeless or vagrants. Parking is very tight but never went without a place on property for car. Office personnel were friendly and helpful.

81 helpful votes,59 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Expect vintage charm, not perfection","This is not a high end hotel. It has tiny rooms, a dinky bathroom, a ""kitchenette"" area.   The walls are freshly painted, fairly new carpet, new windows. Overall, the room was basically clean except for the kitchen area. Said kitchen area had a left behind bag of potato chips in a cupboard, an ancient fridge with a rusted shelf, and two very dried mouse poops on top of the microwave. The hot water in that sink did not turn on, but the cold worked. There were Non-remodeled cupboards, drawers and a two burner hot plate. This kitchenette was behind a door.   No closet, there was a rack with a bar in one corner to hang clothes. There was a large flat screen tv in the room. The bed is not top end, but not low end either, medium firmness.

6 helpful votes,8 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,An old tired motel that has seen better days,"I'm not sure if this was the worst experience I've had at a hotel in my whole life but it certainly has to be close. There was a cigarette burn hole in the bed spread. I was there for 4 nights and the internet worked correctly one night, for a couple hours another night and not at all the other 2 nights. One day they skipped maid service and didn't clean the room. The bathtub was badly damaged and somebody tried to repaint it in a miserable fashion. The bath tub drain was so slow I had to shower quickly or end up standing in my own dirty bath water. There was no stopper of any kind for the vanity sink. The TV had a problem and the picture was a bunch of color blobs. It was cheap and the days they did clean the room it wasn't too bad. That's about all I can sya good about it.",January 2018,The only reason to ever stay here is if it's the only place you can afford.

292 helpful votes,658 contributions,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Not worth the money,"I chose to stay here on my last night of a SoCal trip.  Bad choice!  I picked the place because the price was right and it was in reasonable proximity to the airport and ""Old Town"" Tustin.  The room smelled musty.  The bathroom was a disaster.  The water was lukewarm at best.  The toilet barely flushed.  There was no coffee maker and no continental breakfast.  The WIFI worked ""most"" of the time.  The good things were that it was quiet (although from the look of some of the vehicles parked by rooms adjacent to mine that could change) and it was close to Old Town.  I would not recommend this hotel.",February 2015,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,13,319

2 helpful votes,2 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good bang for your buck,"I have stayed at the motor lodge for the past 11/2 years, nearly once a month. Granted some of the beds are hard and left me hurting the next day but I found that you can always go to the owner (also manager) and he will make sure you are as happy as possible. Our non smoking room had been smoked in and the owner up graded me to a large, fancy room for free. Any issues are always dealt with right away.  The units I have stayed in are compact but always clean (no nasty sheets etc) and compared to more expensive hotels, you won't get athletes foot here. Everything gets scrubbed and bleached daily.  At $60.00 a night this cozy place is close to freeways, restaurants, fast food and grocery. They come with small fridge as well as microwave (at no extra charge, like Motel 6).

The place is quiet and clean and has good wireless internet access (never failed during the 2 month stay). The room was very confortable and the room service was nice to the point of waiting extra time to clean the room after a couple of late wake ups of mine - definitely 5 stars.

3 helpful votes,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,What an amazing turnaround!!!,"The Tustin Motor Lodge in Tustin, CA is probably the best deal I've seen in quite a while, especially in Southern California. I had a bad experience there once before, but I decided to give it  a shot as a last resort since I was in a bind. The management has changed, and the rooms have been refurnished (dark wood & granite countertops). The price of a basic room with one queen sized bed, a tub in the bathroom, A/C and Heat, with free HBO and ESPN is an astounding $50 a night (after tax). The room was clean, the beds were freshly made, and the staff was always courteous and friendly, and happily accomodated my need for more towels.

17 helpful votes,1 contribution,1.0 of 5 bubbles,I'd rather have Two Ciggarette Budds on my pillow please,"Do all motels perpetuate the alleged stereotype as ‚ÄúTACKY‚Äù and ‚ÄúRUDE‚Äù establishments?  Yes, only if you book a room at the Tustin Motor Lodge Motel.  Not only is there the challenge of parking into compact-sized space (considered ‚Äúguest parking‚Äù) but one would have to deal with the rude profiling from guest services. This ‚Äúopened 24 hour‚Äù motel doesn‚Äôt require holding reservations, but a booking upon request.  In this sense, this is to mean that all available rooms will be ready and clean upon reservation. Unfortunately, there was a ‚Äúmishap‚Äù and we received a room that looked already occupied.   When we entered the unit and it smelled of opened beer and smoked cigarettes. Next to our honestly advertised color television set were roughly 40 beer bottles. Half were empty in trash",February 2006,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,19,319
