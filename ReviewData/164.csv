This woman checked my 3-room group of student-athletes in without a single issue, all while answering phones, greeting people who came into the lobby, and helping people check out at the Market...and she did it all faster than I would expect to be checked in even if the lobby was empty.

Recipe for a headache and to flare up my asthma a bit.  I do hope the hotel was able to find out which room was the offending room and charge those people an extra $250.00 to get rid of that smell.
