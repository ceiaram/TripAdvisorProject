So from the time you get off the freeway to the lobby is like 2 minutes.  All the staff is great.  I am horrible with names, but they are all really friendly and helpful.  The hotel has a huge breakfast/happy hour area, although its closed rignt now to to Covid.  But it will be great when open!!  the rooms are set up nicely and comfortable.  Easy temp controls, lots of outlets, and the best part:  a ceiling fan over the bed.  Room was nice and quiet with good light-blocking drapes.  Its right across the stree from a nice strip mall with lots of good places to eat.  I love the Inka Grill (Peru).  but lots to choose from.  So its a great place to stay.  BTW, it has a kitchen, full 'frig and dishwasher, but",July 2020,none,none,"Dear Bill K, Thank you for your amazing 5 star review at our property. It is definitely a convenient area that we are in due to various of restaurants being near us along with the freeway as well! It is also pleasant to know that our staff was nothing but respectful and kind during your stay. It is very important for us to ensure our staff is helpful and friendly during everyone's stay so that we can receive positive reviews like yours! It is definitely a sad time we are living, and we do wish our restaurant was open for our guests to use but unfortunately due to the circumstances it is best for us to ensure we are practicing social distancing to prevent more cases from rising. We do hope in the near future when it does become open or even sooner that we see you again! Thank you again for your amazing feedback and we appreciate your ongoing business with Hilton.",none,none,none,none,none,none,82,273

The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Hilton is doing a wonderful job with their stay clean procedures, when we arrived the dishwasher was sealed so we knew everything had been thoroughly washed.   The hotel is a quick drive to Irvine Spectrum so the location is perfect to enjoy a nice dinner date then head back to the hotel and relax in their hot tub.   Bonus: The rooms have a kitchenette so if you‚Äôre like me and always have leftovers you can bring them back and enjoy later by heating up in the room.

This hotel has only been open a month and everything is top notch and modern!  Super clean hotel, they have protective glass at the check in stand and plenty of hand sanitizer in the lobby area. They had  seals on the doors and the dishwasher so you know that everything was thoroughly sanitized.  The room had a full kitchen with pretty much everything we needed.  We really felt at home at this hotel, actually  better because we don‚Äôt have a Jacuzzi! You do have to sign up to use at the Front Desk because of Covid distancing but it‚Äôs super easy & the staff is very helpful. We felt very safe from Covid, even safer than our house!

Clean and very nice.  We made an reservation for the pool and it was great. Went in everyday. They had bagged breakfast for us. 24 hour coffee available. Michelle at the front desk was great helped us quite a bit. When we left another hotel that was horrible to come there.  We will stay again for sure.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Comfortable quiet stay with husband and 3 month old baby,"We recently stayed at this hotel on a Friday night. It was quiet and very comfortable. Conveniently located right off the freeway, very easy to find and lots of parking.   Beautiful floors as you walk in! Really cute furniture, nice atmosphere! We had a king room on the freeway side and to my surprise you couldn‚Äôt hear any freeway noise at all. Our 3 month old baby slept well, which is always a good thing! The beds were extremely comfortable, wish I could take the mattress home with me! The room had a kitchen area, we didn‚Äôt really use it, but it looked nice and clean.

5 helpful votes,3 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Hotel,"Very clean, the staff are very helpful and friendly, the furnishing and the rooms are very clean and new. There is a lot of parking. During the COVID pandemic, the pool is closed but the fitness room is open, and the breakfast was limited, but it was complementary, and to use the wifi you need to give your last name and room number which means it is pretty secure compared to other hotels.

11 helpful votes,11 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Brand New and EVERYTHING you need!,"I had to come down to California at the last minute to visit family and this hotel was close and reasonably priced.  I didn't know it had just opened!  Everything was pristine, the lobby, rooms, lounge.  Things are different because of Covid, so I had to request things I needed from housekeeping (towels, extra soap, etc.).  But this is preferable for me since I don't really want/need extra people in my room (and all the staff I encountered were wearing masks, which was very comforting).  I had a ""King Studio"" room which has a full kitchen - very nice surprise and handy considering mostly everything in California is closed (sigh).  I went to the grocery store, stocked up, and made all of my meals there.  Much healthier :).

33 helpful votes,13 contributions,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Skip this hotel,"Not a good experience at all. Front desk staff are rude and very unhelpful. Rooms are not cleaned well and unlike other Hilton properties this hotel does not disinfect well. Rooms are not sealed and guaranteed to be disinfected. Our microwave was filthy and the room needed be re-cleaned. During COVID and this area being in the rise for deaths and cases, this is unacceptable. There was also a problem with the outlets in that every time you plugged something into one, the room would go dark and the fuse would blow. During our entire week long stay there was no housekeeping. No extra towels or soaps. You need to call to the front desk to request everything. We piled our trash in the hallway and used towels as did everyone else. They were gone usually by the next day.
