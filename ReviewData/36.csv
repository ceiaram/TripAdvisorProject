Improvements: they only serve coffee and tea for a fee til 10 am. The hot water takes a minute. Start the shower a few minutes early and wait. They should start serving buffet breakfast again included in the price. It came complimentary when I booked but by the time the trip came around there was no more breakfast included.

The actual room was not so great, in particular the bathroom was AWFUL. To begin with, there us no actual door for the bathroom, it's like a closet door on rollers, impossible to actually close and no way to lock. The bathroom fan doesn't function so it stays steamed up IF you can get the water to stay hot (it fluctuates between cold and hot while using.) The toiletries were minimal, with no shampoo (but face wash, hair conditioner and lotion available.) The only place to hang clothes or towels is INSIDE THE SHOWER, which is ridiculous.

Sitting in the lounge area is extremely relaxing especially in front of the fireplaces. Outside there is a huge perfect sparkly infinity pool which is heated a bit.

1 helpful vote,1 contribution,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Family Disneyland Trip,"Great room; clean, quiet, and comfy beds. I’m super picky on hotels so I did a lot of research, was very happy with my decision to stay here. Not a bad walk to Disneyland, a bit over a half mile I believe. We walked a couple of times and then took our car to the Disneyland parking garage a couple of times...after doing both, I think it was actually less of a walk from the hotel, plus then we didn’t pay an extra $30 a day for Disney parking. The only issue I had was coming and going from the hotel, they have a key card entry/exit system that never worked for us. Wasn’t too big of a deal though because I just called the front desk from the screen and they buzzed me out. Friendly staff, nice ambiance.

There is a beachy vibe thanks to the decor. It is about an 18 minute walk to the park which is once of the closest brand name hotels. The room had a fridge and a microwave. The bed was very comfortable.  The pool is beautiful and has long hours so you can soak in the spa after a day at Disney. There is sit down food service close, but not many options for quick family food close. The plus is the location is pretty quiet.  The major con for us was the lack of breakfast. It had been advertised as a benefit for Diamond members and the lack of this was the biggest con of the trip.

We were greeted warmly by the front desk. After checking in, we had a nice chat with the manager, Mr. David Guiterrez. He actually made our Disney trip even better when he informed me of what the procedure was to get on the ride ""Rise of the Resistance."" Without his information, we would have most likely been shut out on our first day at the park. Getting on that ride was part of the reason we made reservations at the park. The proximity to Disneyland (walking distance), cleanliness, and accommodating staff made our stay exceptional, enough so that we booked an extra night to relax before driving back to northern California the next day.

It was a while ago, but I wanted to post how this hotel was the perfect stay close to the Convention Center.  Comfortable rooms, accommodating and friendly FD agents.  Many hoteliers were staying there as well and we all raved about.... Bryce (our bartender)!  After a full work/conference day he recommended the perfect snack which he ran back to the kitchen after hours and made himself... warm chocolate chip cookies!  This became our nightly fav which he made each night without us even asking.

They waived everything upon check-in with proof from my booking site, but I had problems after that. They tried to make me pay for everything when I checked-out.

The recent overhaul changing the theme to mostly a surf vibe is nice.  I’m disappointed in what Hilton has done to the running of the property.  I guess when I’m charged $17.95 a day for parking, I expect secured parking to slow down vandals and burglars from completing their tasks.  When you put out the same breakfast product that was once free, and now charge $8.95 per person; well that’s a bit of a stretch.

Somewhat of a new facility with modern modest country style.  Rooms are a good size with microwave and small refrigerator.    Five story building.

I assure you this is isolated incident of a large youth group hoping and planning to maintain order with the tens of youth in their group and who also wanted to ensure other guests like your self were comfortable.

I stayed here to go to Disneyland, and it was a very short Lyft ride over. I did have an issue my first night, where all the plugs except the one on the desk decided not to work. However, when I brought it up the next morning, all the outlets worked, and they even gave me a chocolate wrench for my trouble. Sadly I don't know how it tastes because I forgot it in my room! The staff is friendly and willing to help. The only other notes I have is the bed and pillows were uncomfortable, but that is often a matter of personal opinion.

Over the years, I have stayed at a majority of the hotels around disneyland. I can say without a doubt, this hotel is the BEST hotel to stay at if you are visiting disneyland.  Location: It's just a short 2 block walk to the disneyland entrance. Since it's located to the east of disneyland, it's not a crowded walk either. When I mean short, it's less than 10 minutes.

Also close to lots of restaurants. - Set away from the busyness of Disneyland.   CONS: - Limited clothing storage.

Was nice to see management out and about chatting with the guests. It was a short walk to the main park entrance to Disneyland. For our 5 and 9 year old it was no problem but the Anaheim resort transit does pickup and drop off as well if you want to rest your legs. The breakfast was perfect for us! Great selection. We had a great view from our room to see the firework show! The salt water pool was just the right temperature for our family; hot tub was great in cooler evenings. Everything was clean.

Country Inn & Suites definitely rises up above the rest.   First of all, the location is good. Right off the freeway and easy to find. A pretty short walk to disney (.6 miles to maingate) about a 12 minute walk with a stroller. The only minor drawback I would say about this hotel is it's can be a bit noisy for light sleepers since you can hear the faint freeway noise. I think every room will have some freeway view since the 5 is diagonally positioned to the hotel.   FREE PARKING!

The room was also quiet, which is a big plus.  We have stayed at other hotels near Disneyland and the walls seem to be so thin, we can always hear the neighbors; not here though.

It's not anything fancy, but enough choice for the kids and adults to get some energy for the day at Disney.

With a line behind me, the clerk loudly declared my card was declined (because I have a daily limit for security purposes) and I was surprised they we're charging me as if I had stayed there at check in!

The bed was comfy, the room was quiet, and there was plenty of space to move around. The sink is inside the bathroom, which always gets a ding in my book. When a room is shared between 4 people, having a vanity sink outside the bathroom is a huge plus.
