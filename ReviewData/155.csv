We were on the 4th floor and found the whole week to be quiet. The only noise came from the fireworks at Disneyland, which we enjoyed actually. Some reasons we chose Wyndham Anaheim: Starbucks in the lobby, a hotel (indoor hallways), secure parking that had enough spots and was included in the booking price, pool & hot tub, mini fridge-coffee maker-microwave kitchenette, walkable to DL & DCA, and a good price. After staying here, I will add that the beds were also comfy. We needed and got a lot of good sleep - rested up for the next day's adventure!

Please call us directly at 714-991-6868 and ask to speak to the Manager on Duty and we can help you go through the appropriate outlets to ensure you can move the dates so you have time to grieve for your dog, we completely understand how tough times like this can be.

If you were charged through Booking.com, please call us and we can contact them to confirm you did not physically stay at the property so they can issue you a refund through their merchant. A guest also reviewed that the 3rd party company did not offer assistance with a cancellation and once this was brought to our attention our management team worked diligently with the guest and other travel agency to reconcile, as 52malissak previously reviewed on TripAdvisor and updated the posting thanking our hotel for all the help.

After thoroughly reviewing our reservation system at the front desk we were unable to locate your stay with your name and the duration of 6 nights to match. We have also reached out to Trip Advisor to contact you and inform you that you have reviewed the wrong Wyndham property since we do not have an Asian male at our front desk. Our property is the Wyndham Garden Anaheim located at 515 West Katella, all of our rooms are indoors as well as our lobby so the exposure to rain from the room to our lobby would be nearly impossible. Please feel free to contact me directly at 714-991-6868 and I can help you locate the correct Wyndham property, please also contact me for any future bookings and we will ensure you get the best stay you deserve under our Wyndham branch.

It is unfortunate and surprising to read that you had somebody knocking on your door at 6:40AM only because our housekeeping department does not clock in until 9AM, if this was reported at the time of the incident we could have sent Security to check the discrepancy and let you get the rest you deserve especially with your medical ailment. I was reviewing your reservation and you did check into a king room with a street view of Katella; there was not any alerts or notes to have you in a quiet room or top floor, at the front desk we will always do our best to be accommodating as possible to ensure you get the best stay you deserve, for future reservations please do contact us directly so we can add these special notes to your reservation to have you on our highest floor and a pool view for a quieter room. Concerning your late check out request, our front desk team member was informed by the housekeeping supervisor that she did not have you on her list of late check outs after 11AM therefore she requested for her to call you to get an estimate of your departure since all the rooms must be serviced before 3PM for the next arriving guests. I apologize if you were granted a late check out and that it was not passed on appropriately to the next shift, we still do genuinely hope to get the chance to welcome you back and provide you with the best Wyndham Garden experience you fully deserve as one of our guests!

I usually have a main go-to hotel when in the area, but I think my recent stay will cause me to be a repeat guest here. As far as hotels go, the hotel rooms are average - nothing out of the ordinary - but they are clean, modern, and the beds are very comfortable after long days and the room sports a nice clean modern bathroom. But what puts this ahead of the other places I've stayed at are the free parking (and plenty of it), the very walkable location to the Disney parks, the easy freeway access for visiting other attractions, walkable food options and of course, I mentioned the customer experience.

I called twice before arriving and the staff was excellent. We requested a crib in our room, which was already in the room when we checked in.   The hotel is super clean and bright. Modern lobby and rooms. My main comment is NO free breakfast. We did eat some delicious breakfast sandwiches that were 2 for $5.00. Also, the parking is underground, and secured, and free!  The room was bright and large. In room lock box, our room had the sleeper sofa, and a walk in shower. Very clean and comfortable.   I highly recommend this location if you are going to Disneyland.

I do recall reading on our daily reports that a front desk agent sent up a housekeeper to clean the stains on your ceiling immediately after you reported it to our morning team; that following night Andy rushed to your room when you called about the cleaning odor. He serviced the room the best he could with your family present in it and when I spoke to you moments later that night I gave you several options of how we can resolve the issue at hand and make you and your family more comfortable. Ultimately your family decided to move rooms, which we were happy and eager to accommodate; we luckily found you a room right next door and assisted with your luggage, further more I personally delivered complimentary breakfast vouchers where you thanked me profusely for our diligent service and even mentioned how much you loved the hotel room and property that you asked if I could help you make a second reservation so you could stay another night and not have to check out on your scheduled departure date. As Guest Service Manager I was able to accommodate your second reservation with Half Off the original rate so you only had to pay 50% of your last day with us, which is a great saving bonus. As for the alarm sounding off the next day, you were actually given a formal paper notice upon check in as all of our guests receive at the front desk informing you about our Annual Fire Alarm Safety Test that is mandatory by the City Of Anaheim to ensure our property is up to code, notices were also displayed throughout the property at our front desk counter and in all the elevators on the day before the testing was scheduled. I do hope this response clears up some confusion on your end because every department in our property from my housekeeping team to the front desk team members and my self exasperated all options in assisting you and your family to ensure you had a great stay. I strongly feel that everybody in my team did the best they could to make you comfortable and I am sorry that you felt it was not enough to leave this one star review. I sincerely do hope you have the time to contact me directly at 714-991-6868 so we can be on the same page and so I can learn from you what else I could have done to appease you. Hopefully we get the chance to welcome you back and provide you with the best stay you deserve.  Sincerely, Stacey Bui Guest Service Manager",none,none,none,none,none,none,380,155

Not sure what's going on with the people who gave this less than 4/5 starts,  except maybe they're beyond spoiled.  The rooms were perfection. Totally remodeled.  Up to date EVERYTHING! They are close to the end of a fabulous remodel. There was a small bit of construction still going on but didn't affect us. Parking is substantial and under ground. The pool is a VERY SHORT distance across the way (maybe 40ft), shared with the adjoining NICE hotel during remodel.  The price was GREAT set only $103 night which included all taxes n fees.  And pretty darn close to theme parks.  (I'm 54yo and took me maybe 15min to walk it).  The staff was so very friendly.  This is definitely THE place to stay!!",February 2018,none,none,quilbillymom  Thank you so much for reviewing us!.

I apologize the renovations were not clearly addressed during the time of your booking.

In regards to the air conditioning our units can go below 70° however as with most things condensation can occur after a certain decrease in temperature. Guest safety is a top priority so we do have notices posted by the air conditioner instructions as a precaution. I am concerned to hear about the encounter in the stairwell and odor in the refrigerator. Even while undergoing renovations we do a daily walk through and cleaning of the property. I will address the cleaning with our housekeeping and do ask that you take the time to contact us in regards to your stay.

The reason one star was taken off, and probably more should have been: The hotel is going through a MAJOR remodel. Indeed, we drove right past the hotel the first time as we were checking in at night and the entire property is covered in a black tarp and scaffolding. I went back to check the AAA review on the site (where I had booked) and other than reviews, there is no mention that the hotel is being renovated. With this came a closed pool and spa, so be warned if you wanted those amenities.  That being said, the stay itself was not bad.

Two kids slept on the pull out sofa bed, two on one bed, and adults on the other bed. No breakfast offered here, though I guess there's a buffet restaurant on the property but it was mostly occluded by construction. Parking is included, and they let us keep our car parked on site while we walked to Disneyland even though we checked out early that morning (and didn't leave until 8pm).

They were in the process of remodeling the hotel when we stayed, however we stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms.  It was really nice.

One small detail I loved was that they already had the sheets on the sofa bed, which was nice instead of having to make it ourselves like at other hotels. It is walking distance to Disney, but not quite the 10 minutes they tell you every time you ask. Especially with kids it did take longer. Also, note that if you are going to Down Town Disney you still have to go through the really long security line, which adds even more time. Which can be a hassle if you are rushing to a dinner reservation. Just make sure to leave with plenty of time.

The hotel is obviously well managed.  The proximity to Disneyland is great.  There is a shuttle but it's only a 15 minute walk, and both options work well.  The pool is small and unremarkable but good enough to cool down on a hot day.  Beds were comfortable and the rooms felt clean.  Parking is free and convenient. Cons:  The hotel itself feels a little run down, which is probably why they are in the middle of a renovation.

Our carpet was actually damp (based on reading all of these reviews I think they cleaned them recently). Bathroom is outdated as is entire hotel. This translates into a broken shower head and grungy toilet seat, carpet in hallways is dirty, elevator smells funky, etc. The A/C is horrible. They need to replace all of them (read the reviews)!!!!

But, other than that, the only thing worth the money was the shower, which was actually pretty decent for a hotel this price. The hotel sheets were itchy, way too over bleached. NONE of the 10 pillows were comfortable and I struggled to sleep on them. There were TWO windows, both of which opened to the third floor without any window - dangerous anyone? The air felt great, but within a few minutes, all the cold air had left the room - perhaps the double paned window which had no sealing was the blame. OLD school microwave and fridge.

It was perfect for our visit to the Disneyland parks, the staff were very helpful and kind, and having the restaurant on the bottom level was convenient.  There was some construction going on in the restroom area, which caused a bit of noise and was slightly inconvenient since we had to use the pool bathroom instead of the lobby bathroom, but nothing serious.    Rooms were clean, there is a nice mini-fridge and microwave available.  However, the mini fridge didn't quite seem to get down to the temperature needed to really refrigerate food - was more like a cooler - and the knob that I assume was supposed to be used to adjust it was broken off.

7 helpful votes,3 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice stay overall but could do better,"General maintenance seems to be a little lacking, eg safe not attached to wall properly, doors with patched up parts, walls with open screw holes where things that have been attached to the walls have been removed.  Air conditioning works great when it's on but it's loud. There is no low or medium fan setting - it's either max speed or off. So you need to run it overnight to keep the room cool so it goes on and off as per the thermostat. When it comes on during the night when you're asleep you think there could be a 747 about to land in the room.

The hotel was having their driveway and outdoor parking area painted.  The paint being used was extremely noxious and basically gave us headaches and left us feeling light headed.  The smell was in most hallways, the main lobbey, the elevators and the emergency stairwell exits.

It is our goal to exceed guest expectations and we are disappointed that we fell short during your stay. However, we take your comments seriously and will review them as a way to continue to improve.  It is apparent that a few situations going array created a bad situation all around. Some times attempts to make improvements can cause inconveniences to others which appeared  to be the case with our parking lot improvements. I personally had spoken with the repairman regarding the smell. They do this daily for a living and had responded that they did not feel the need to use a mask while using the materials they were using on our parking lot. They said that other materials they did use a mask but these were fine. In regards to our Jacuzzi, it was inconvenient that it was not operable during your visit. Unfortunately, the repairmen do not come out on holidays and we were waiting for their availability to fix the problem.  We agree that having to ask for an item to be repaired three times is unacceptable. We have brought this situation to management and will continue to correct the issue. Overall, we receive numerous compliments on our housekeeping staff and the cleanliness of the hotel.  Therefore, your comment regarding small pieces not being picked up off the floor alerts us to maybe there was a problem with the vacuum and we are looking into this.

At the Ramada Plaza Anaheim, we aim to exceed guest expectations and we can see that we failed in your case which we find very disappointing. However, we will review these issues as a way to improve for the future. First, we can see how we did not start off on the right foot immediately as you entered the room. Of course, it was no fault of yours that the door was jammed. Yet, if another guest has a concern about noise, valid or not, we still have to respond to it. We hope that you understand. I assure you that we take guest safety very seriously.  Therefore, we do a regular check on the smoke detectors in our rooms. We can definitely understand how the beeping would have been a great inconvenience to you and we do apologize,  but it is the beeping that lets us know that the batteries need to be changed so that we may offer better safety.  There is no excuse why the maintenance person did not return to repair the problem or to notify you if the problem could not be repaired. We have communicated this issue to the department head. In regards to the shuttle  we do not operate this shuttle service. The city of Anaheim does. We only recommend it as an alternate option to those guests choosing not to walk to Disneyland Resort.   The bus runs approximately every 20 minutes and is usually very reliable. We are not sure how long you waited but if you felt it was way more than 20 minutes, we would suggest contacting Anaheim Resort Transportation.

This most recent stay was a little disappointing. My review scores are mostly based on a collection of all my stays here.  First I prefer the rooms close to the elevator and facing the pool so that I am not on the road facing side. This likely improves noise while sleeping.  I did notice that Floor 3 seems quieter than Floor 4. All the rooms I have tried seem to have bathroom wear and tear that needs attention. While clean, the bathroom floors are always sticky as if they don't rinse the floor after mopping.

The hotel was located within 10-minutes walk from Disneyland entrance, so we were able to walk there.  From the hotel window, we were able to see the backside of Radiator Springs.

Room is quite comfortable but our overall experience was spoiled by a problematic toilet, The toilet blocked on 4 occasions and the staff were responsive EXCEPT on the last occasion when we were handed the plunger and advised to fix it ourselves.   Upon complaining to Karen (Manager) she apologised and offered us a room change - a bit late for this. When advised that we would be writing a letter of complaint, Karen didn't seem overly concerned.  Apart from that - breakfast is OK but very limited and we stopped having it after 7 days.

I will definitely let the owner know about your input in regards of maybe allowing more individuals to login per-room, or maybe having additional modems available at the front desk for those who need additional access.  Lastly, our hotel doesn't have a snack vending machine or a snack shop. The reason for this is because there are various stores within walking distance such as 711 for our guest.

Some reviewers said this hotel was too far from Disneyland, we made the walk in less than 15 minutes several times.  Other times we used the shuttle.  Tickets may be purchased in the lobby.  We didn't need the staff at the desk much, but they were very helpful when we did.  The room was clean and had plenty of room.  We wanted an extra large room since we would be here for 5 days and the room we had was just what we asked for.  The only disappointments were that the pool was only 4' deep, and the day we wanted to use the hot tub, it was out of order.  The hot tub worked on the other days.  I wouldn't mind staying here if I ever return to California.",none,none,none,"Dear Valued Guest: Thank you for taking the time to share your comments on Trip Advisor regarding your stay with us at the Ramada Plaza Anaheim.

The rooms were very spacious, and ultra clean. The lobby is also quite large and welcoming, with a cheery little Indian restaurant tucked in at the back. I only had breakfast at the restaurant, and though basic, it was very good food. As a solo traveller, I found the friendly, helpful staff to be most reassuring. The pool area was good size, and it was always nice to return to a warm spa after a long day in Disneyland. There was a minor incident which occured when the entire hotel lost power at around 7pm one night. Of course, this was totally beyond their control, but the staff were most professional in their actions to alert all the guests of the situation, and returned power within",none,none,none,"Dear Valued Guest: Thank you for taking the time to share your comments on Trip Advisor regarding your stay with us at the Ramada Plaza Anaheim.

My wife set up the package through Expedia. We would be only a few blocks from Disneyland Park. We flew Our granddaughter from Utah to Arizona on 3/27/04. On 3/28/04 We flew to California with reversations at the Ramada Plaza Hotel in Anaheim for 3 nights. Which would be March 28, 29, & 30. We stayed in room 341. It was a nice room with 2 double beds. I slep in one bed and my wife and granddaughter slep in the other. The first morning when we got up I showed my wife that something had bitten the daylights out of me around my ankles.

It is close but not close enough to walk and the shuttle service (city shuttle) was a little slow.  The room was nice but the walls are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING.  When you go out in the hallway at 7 am it sounds like there is a huge party going on.  The bed was very very uncomfortable.  We found out upon arrival that the resteraunt was closed because of new ownership and that would have been a deciding factor in whether we stayed at the hotel in the first place because we have an infant and cannot leave the hotel to eat at any given time.

It is located too far away from Disneyland to be an easy walk and its shuttle service is a bit rare.  The room was comfortable and well appointed.  The on site restaurant was very good for breakfast.  The swimming pool was laid out quite nice.  We were not going to Disneyland while we were they so we used the hotel as a place for us to drive down to the San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park.  We also wanted to do many other Southern California sites so the easy access to the freeways made the Ramada Plaza Anaheim a good place to stay.  Oh yes, the price was more than good.
