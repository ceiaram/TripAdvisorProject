Check in was next door at Holiday Inn as 14 West’s reception was closed due to COVID.  Upon walking into Holiday Inn, we were immediately greeted by Nasrin who was very welcoming and friendly. My husband told her it was my birthday and she sang happy birthday to me, nice touch. She let us check in a bit early which was great and let us know she was there if we needed anything since the hotel didn’t have any services at the time.  Our room was awesome! Clean and private.

And, worst case scenario is that it was perhaps mixed up with the linens.  The next day you did informed one of our staff about the missing blouse, they've search the entire room and found nothing.  My staff went through the batch of linens for 3 hours and found nothing.  We asked the company who washes our linens to keep their eyes peeled or to let us know ASAP once they found it.   I truly apologize if all of our efforts finding your lost blouse failed.  We have the same staff for the last 3 years and nothing like this ever happened.

They are big enough for two people but not more. A few details made our stay mediocre: very nasty and sticky hair dryer, no blinds for roof windows, lots of noise from neighbors, some fixtures were not properly installed or broken, TV cable box is in the closet, daily maid service is a 'refresh' which might happen or not. I would recommend to rent units further away from PCH. So management should be able to fix those issues.",April 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,237,163

The owners and staff are fantastic.I  had originally booked a room with one bed and a cot (that was all that was available). The cot was just not going to cut if for my 18 year old. Immediately we were switched to another room that could not have been more comfortable.  In fact, I slept better there than i have in  a long time.I have to find out the make of the bed --- i might just buy one! The common area outside the rooms is really cool with comfy lounge chairs, table and chairs, BBQ and hot tub. It has a communal feel which we really liked.  The rooms are very modern, which again is up our alley. The location is great. you can walk to all the restaurants, stores and beach.

4 helpful votes,6 contributions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Excellent, excellent value.","My wife and I recently spent several nights at 14 West - part of a much anticipated vacation for the two of us.  We picked the hotel because of its central location in Laguna Beach, studio apt-like trappings (working kitchen), and cost.  Also, I travel for work, and the idea of NOT staying in a traditional hotel was appealing.  We arrived after-hours on the night of our arrival and had to negotiate the hotel's security to get the car parked and the room unlocked.  We had zero problems.  The hotel sent clear instructions on how to do it in advance and even sent us a text on the day of our arrival.  There are several different rooms (14 I think), the majority of which have floor to ceiling windows looking out at an elevated common area/terrace.

It was a much needed girls vacation. We enjoyed the Laguna area very much. The people were genuinely nice. We are vegans and it was no problem finding good food. In fact, The Stand, which is a vegan spot was only two lights away. Everything was in walking distance (Whole Foods, dairy-free gelato, falafel, beach,etc). We rented a car anyway because we wanted to go to LA, which was only an hour away. Hands down the best vacation I've had thus far.",March 2013,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,240,163

You can choose to eat out at all the nearby restaurants or cook there as each rooms have a kitchenette and also a BBQ grill out on the common area. Rooms are very comfortable with a king sized bed and sitting area. After a tiring day with the kids we were able to relax in the jacuzzi!

Excellent and friendly service by staff, very reasonable prices, and right in the middle of downtown Laguna. We easily walked to beach, restaurants and bars.

The site indicated a very modern facility with only 14 suites. I spoke directly to the manager to inquire about reservations, as we travel with a pet.  She was helpful and informative.  We booked the LaHoya Suite #6 and were not disappointed.  Spacious and modern with a fireplace. 14 West is the perfect location in Laguna Beach (just across street from beach). Walk everywhere! We did not need our car.  Price, room maintenance, kitchenette, welcoming manner from staff all EXCELLENT.  Will stay here again for sure.

This was our first time in laguna and by far the best place to stay. Its modern, hip, sophisticated, and quiet. Located right next to Ralph's for groceries as the rooms have kitchenettes. The beach is literally across the street. The price is much better than the hotels on the beach and much cleaner. There is even a hot tub and bbq grills right outside the rooms, parking is a piece of cake because you get your own spot in the garage and can walk to all restaurants and shopping. I brought my husband here to surprise him with some friends for his 30th birthday. Carolyn from 14west went out of her way to post happy birthday signs in the room, included balloons, champaign, and a cupcake.

The studio was clean and well-equipped, the bed was great for the adults and the futon was big enough for our 6 and 8 year old to share.
