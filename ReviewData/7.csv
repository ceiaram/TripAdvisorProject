Jess, the front desk concierge was absolutely fabulous. Not only was she helpful but she was very thoughtful and considerate. She brought up champagne to our room shortly after we checked in and when she found out we didn't drink alcohol, she asked what we did drink and we said ""water"" with a chuckle. 5 minutes later to our surprise she had brought us two ice cold ""fancy"" waters. It was the best water i have ever tasted. It was special for my wife and I to get to cheers each other in honor of one another. Thank you Jess! This hotel was amazing to say the least.

There were no other rooms available and the attendant got a little testy when I was disappointed by that and then I was unimpressed by his offer to waive the $35 parking fee.

That didn't feel good. After asking for them to check again using my drivers license information, we finally were given the room we requested. We were put in Room 307. Pathetically, our ""balcony"" turned out to be a patio with litter around the perimeter and shrubs blocking our ocean view. See the two photos to see the litter.

Given the price tag, the rooms were in poor repair and showing significant signs of aging. Floors were damp, rusting was evident on hinges.

This led the entry door to have significant gaps and allowing light and sound thus poor sleep. Lastly the rooftop “bar” was a rolling cart. Drinks were expensive and not good at all.

Absolutely horrible experience. Not worth even a penny let alone hundreds of dollars. There are many other choices in the city way better and more affordable than this hotel. First: the lady at the front desk tried to overcharge me when I arrived by saying that rooms are $269 while the customer service rep said it was $215, and I had to call him and have her hear him on the phone to charge me the same amount he quoted.

I am saddened to hear your stay was less than enjoyable. It was the correct rate that was offered to you at Front Desk, also when you called back to our reservations departments they confirmed the same rate, but after you asked for some discount, they were glad to provide some discount for you, also we had the same rates posted online on our web site. We have different room types at the hotel and you are right, all the rooms with a balcony have ocean view because they are all the same room type - Ocean View with a balcony and we have gorgeous direct ocean view because we are located right on the Main Beach. We also we have rooms without balconies, which are village view, standard or pool level rooms. As I know, before check in you requested to look at couple of rooms and our employee walked you to the rooms, including the balconies and I believe it was no any tissues on the balcony at that time, I apologize if you found some later. Due to COVID-19 we are doing extra cleaning and disinfecting in all the rooms, also to make sure our guests and employees are safe, we are doing cleaning only 48 hours after every check out.

Second, does anyone really like the zucchini water in the lobby?  Surely lemons would be preferable.

It is a beautiful inn in a beautiful location; however, it is on a very busy street.  Our room was situated between the busy street and the elevator was right behind our room.  So, needless to say, it was a bit difficult to sleep that night.

For what we paid for the room we should have at least had a glimpse of the ocean and a way quieter location.

That's the view you'll see from The Inn at Laguna. Finally in 2007 I moved to nearby Dana Point, and this view is still one of my favorites in California.  Everything is expensive in Laguna, especially hotels, but The Inn is where I host out of town guests because, for Laguna, it's mid-range, yet right on the water, with a hilltop view of the entire town that rivals the view of Diamond Head from Waikiki, in my opinion.

Rating anything is a subjective task and to do so you generally compare your experience with something else.  At the price point we paid to stay at the Inn I must compare it to the other ""resorts"" in the area.  I will compare the Inn with the Montage, the Ritz Carlton, and the Avaria where we have also stayed.  On paper its an unfair comparison with the Inn bringing a knife to a gun fight.  The Inn is not a resort and lacks much of what the other resorts offer.

As unfortunate as the events are that are unfolding around the world, it's important for us to remain neutral and hospitable to all people including those who may share wholly different views from our own.

I would give 5 stars for the location but that's really all positive I have to say. The  hotel reminds me more of a street side motel  from the 50s with one big exception, the prices are more like top notch NY 5star hotel. I paid in excess of USD 500 per room and for this I had to drag my own suitcase to the room, there was no complimentary water in the room and worst of all, there was an ancient coffee machine but the water was also extra - pure rip off in my humble opinion.

Best beach, nice walking distance to restaurant and shops.  Service was also great by the staff.  Very attentive.  The Good:  Pool was nice and adequate for the hotel, but nothing to rave about.  Wine reception was nice but very limited in time in my opinion.  The Average: For the price we paid ($500+ a night) I felt like the hotel was not at par.

This is a great location that facilitates your exploration of Laguna and other beaches, Newport, Huntgington, etc. The room was very clean, but very small—seemed like a shoebox. The pool was also a great draw, but was small  and had limited seating. The beach had massive amounts of seaweed which made laying at the beach difficult. The hotel did provide chairs, but they were small and not fit for adults to use for a day.

The hotel pool is small, but a good alternative. 2) Limited room service is from the overpriced ( and mediocre) restaurant next door. Even so, this was a very good hotel.

The staff is very friendly and helpful, NOUR at the front desk was very welcoming, helpful and made us feel right at home. The hotel is at a prime location in Laguna Beach and very convent for walking around shops and restaurants. NOUR also provided us with information on all the services they offer and the different things we could do in the area. It was a great place to go to!",September 2012,none,none,"Nancy D  Thank you for your kind comments and for recognizing the efforts of our staff and in particular Nour.

The hotel is positioned right on the best section of Laguna's beaches - away from all of the noise however just a two minute walk into the heart of downtown.  The room was fantastic, by far exceeding our expectations.  Very clean and comfortable bedding, gorgeous views of the beach and sunsets, and lots of space within the room.  The staff were perfect....always available to help and full of great suggestions.  Not only is this place an incredible value, I would hold it up to any of the hotels in the Laguna and Newport areas.  You won't find a better opportunity to stay in a top-notch hotel located directly on the beach in all",September 2012,none,none,"BD  Thank you for your wonderful review of the property.  We would agree that our location is perfect, as there is no need to get in your car once you have arrived.

The pool is ok and the also have well heated jacuzzi.  All rates include breakfast wich comes to your room or to the roof terasse. Coffe you have to brew yourself in the room or to buy at vis avis starbucks.  The beach infront of the hotel is really nice but hasn´t any facillities beside a shower. At the hotel you can get an umbrella and some tiny beachchairs to make your beachlife more comfortable. Parking is also free. Summarized it is a good hotel if you´re on the beachside",August 2012,none,none,"Dear Reisebein  Thank you for your comments regarding your recent visit to the Inn at Laguna Beach.  It is true we are nestled atop the bluff between the Pacific Ocean and Pacific Coast Highway but this is not unusual for the hotels in Laguna.  More than half of our rooms do face the ocean as this is the preferred view.  We are no longer delivering complimentary continental breakfast; however, for a small charge we have an upgraded coffee service with fresh baked goods to be delivered to your room.  With our location we have over 40 fabulous restaurants that are all within walking distance that serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

4 helpful votes,10 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Best of Laguna,"I stayed at this hotel in June and had a great experience whilst indulging in a sea view suite- waking up to the sound of waves every morning was pure vacation perfection. While back in the area in early September, I could't help but indulge once again. Booking a sea view suite for two nights- i could hardly wait. The following day i received a phone call to say our room  had been double booked so we could only have the sea view for the second night. I was a little disappointed as the village view rooms are quite small and of course lacking the beautiful private balcony with sea view. When we arrived, the hotel was accommodating and offered to move our luggage the following day as soon as our sea view room was available and they tried make us as comfortable as they could.

43 helpful votes,65 contributions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Fabulous,"We were delighted with our experience at the Inn at Laguna Beach. We had taken the advice ofother tripadvisors and booked an Ocean-facing room and were not disappointed. This Inn provides excellent service, value for money and great little extras (e.g. glass of wine in the evening; body boards; beach deck chairs). We felt extremely welcome and the service was friendly and unpretentious at all times yet still first class. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. I doubt that I'll be lucky enough to be able to return there in the near future but would return again at the drop of a hat should the opportunity arise.",August 2012,none,none,"Dear HH  I am sorry to read that you will not be able to return to Laguna Beach in the near future as we would love to have you back to see more of our little City.

2 helpful votes,1 contribution,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Pity about the view,"This is a great hotel, with nice spacious rooms in a great location, on a fabulous beach, in a really nice town. But if you pay extra for the Ocean View, don't get stuck in room 101 like us, you'll be very disappointed. Yes you can see the ocean, if you lean out the balcony and look left. In a court of law I'm sure it could be proven that the room has an ocean view. But boy were we deflated when we saw it. At least we could still hear the sound of the ocean. Would still recommend this hotel. Staff are great.",July 2012,none,none,"Dear Irish TravellerMF  Thank you for your comments regarding your recent visit.
